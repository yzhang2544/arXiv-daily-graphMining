    "abstract": "Two-photon excitation in the near-infrared (NIR) of colloidal nanocrystalline silicon quantum dots (nc-SiQDs) with photoluminescence also in the NIR has the potential to open up new opportunities in the field of deep biological imaging. Spectra of the degenerate two-photon absorption (2PA) cross section of colloidal nc-SiQDs are measured using two-photon excitation over a spectral range $1.46 < \\hbar \\omega < 1.91$ eV (wavelength $850 > \\lambda > 650$ nm) above the two-photon band gap $E_g^{(QD)}/2$, and at a representative photon energy $\\hbar \\omega = 0.99$ eV ($\\lambda = 1250$ nm) below this gap. Two-photon excited photoluminescence (2PE-PL) spectra of nc-SiQDs with diameters $d = 1.8 \\pm 0.2$ and $d = 2.3 \\pm 0.3$ nm, each passivated with 1-dodecene and dispersed in toluene, are calibrated in strength against 2PE-PL from a known concentration of Rhodamine B dye in methanol. The 2PA cross section is observed to be smaller for the smaller diameter nanocrystals and the onset of 2PA is observed to be blueshifted from the two-photon indirect band gap of bulk Si, as expected for quantum confinement of excitons. The efficiencies of nc-SiQDs for bio-imaging using 2PE-PL are simulated in various biological tissues and compared to other quantum dots and molecular fluorophores and found to be superior at greater depths.

    "abstract": "The continuous scaling of semiconductor-based technologies to micron and sub-micron regimes has resulted in higher device density and lower power dissipation. Many physical phenomena such as self-heating or current leakage become significant at such scales, and mapping current densities to reveal these features is decisive for the development of modern electronics. However, advanced non-invasive technologies either offer low sensitivity or poor spatial resolution and are limited to two-dimensional spatial mapping. Here we use shallow nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond to probe Oersted fields created by current flowing within a multi-layered integrated circuit in pre-development. We show the reconstruction of the three-dimensional components of the current density with a magnitude down to $\\approx 10 \\,\\rm \\mu A / \\mu m^2$ and sub-micron spatial resolution capabilities at room temperature. We also report the localisation of currents in different layers and observe anomalous current flow in an electronic chip. Further improvements using decoupling sequences and material optimisation will lead to nA-current detection at sub-micron spatial resolution. Our method provides therefore a decisive breakthrough towards three-dimensional current mapping in technologically relevant nanoscale electronics chips. ",

    "abstract": "We numerically investigate the deterministic generation of a perfect soliton crystal (PSC) in an optical microresonator functionalized with a saturable absorber (SA). The SA allows the direct formation of a PSC from an initial, periodic Turing roll. It prevents passage through a chaotic state, which induces a stochastic nature as regards the number of generated dissipative Kerr solitons. We show that PSCs form deterministically, and the number is controlled by adjusting the input power and SA parameter. Our work provides a simple approach for obtaining a stable PSC that offers an ultra-high repetition rate and a high comb output power. ",

One chiral force originates from the circular polarization of the light, while remarkably the other is independent of the input polarization, even occurring for unpolarized light, and is not present in 2D structured light nor propagating plane waves. This latter chiral sorting mechanism allows for the enantioselective trapping of chiral particles into distinct rings in the transverse plane through conservative radial forces. ",

It is shown how higher-harmonic membrane modes can be excited selectively and efficiently by appropriate patterning of the transducer electrodes. When filling the half-space above the membrane with a liquid, the higher-harmonic modes induce acoustic pressure fields in the liquid with interference patterns that result in the formation of a single, strong trapping region located 50 - 100 um above the membrane, where a single suspended cell can be trapped in all three spatial directions. The trapping strength depends on the acoustic contrast between the cell and the liquid, and as a specific example it is shown by numerical simulation that by using a 60% iodixanol solution, a cancer cell can be held in the trap.

    "abstract": "The interaction of intense light with matter gives rise to competing nonlinear responses that can dynamically change material properties. Prominent examples are saturable absorption (SA) and two-photon absorption (TPA), which dynamically increase and decrease the transmission of a sample depending on pulse intensity, respectively. The availability of intense soft X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers (FEL) has led to observations of SA and TPA in separate experiments, leaving open questions about the possible interplay between and relative strength of the two phenomena. Here, we systematically study both phenomena in one experiment by exposing graphite films to soft X-ray FEL pulses of varying intensity, with the FEL energy tuned to match carbon 1s to $\\pi^*$ or 1s to $\\sigma^*$ transitions. It is observed for lower intensities that the nonlinear contribution to the absorption is dominated by SA attributed to ground-state depletion; for larger intensities ($>10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$), TPA becomes more dominant. The relative strengths of the two phenomena depend in turn on the specific transition driven by the X-ray pulse. Both observations are consistent with our real-time electronic structure calculations. Our results reveal the competing contributions of distinct nonlinear material responses to spectroscopic signals measured in the X-ray regime, demonstrating an approach of general utility for interpreting FEL spectroscopies.

OPT is able to achieve resolution at a few tens of microns over a large sample volume of several cubic centimeters. However, the reconstructed OPT images often suffer from artifacts caused by different kinds of physical miscalibration. This work focuses on the refractive index (RI) mismatch between the rotating object and the surrounding medium. We derive a 3D cone beam forward model to approximate the effect of RI mismatch and implement a fast and efficient reconstruction method to correct the induced seagull-shaped artifacts on experimental images of fluorescent beads.

    "abstract": "The Wavelength-shifting Optical Module (WOM) is a novel photosensor concept for the instrumentation of large detector volumes with single-photon sensitivity. The key objective is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio which is achieved by decoupling the photosensitive area of a sensor from the cathode area of its photomultiplier tube (PMT). The WOM consists of a transparent tube with two PMTs attached to its ends. The tube is coated with wavelength-shifting paint absorbing ultra-violet photons with nearly $100\\,\\%$ efficiency. Depending on the environment, e.g. air (ice), up to $73\\,\\%$ $(41\\,\\%)$ of the subsequently emitted optical photons can be captured by total internal reflection and propagate towards the PMTs where they are recorded. The optical properties of the paint, the geometry of the tube and the coupling of the tube to the PMTs have been optimized for maximal sensitivity based on theoretical derivations and experimental evaluations. Prototypes were built to demonstrate the technique and to develop a reproducible construction process. Important measurable characteristics of the WOM are the wavelength dependent effective area, the transit time spread of detected photons and the signal-to-noise ratio. The WOM outperforms bare PMTs especially with respect to the low signal-to-noise ratio with an increase of a factor up to 8.9 in air (5.2 in ice). Since the gain in sensitivity is mostly in the UV-regime, the WOM is an ideal sensor for Cherenkov and scintillation detectors. ",

The hybrid manipulation of optical dimensions of wavelength, time, and space enables the direct representation and processing of high-order tensors in optical domain. In the proof-of-concept experiment, processing of multi-channel images and videos is accomplished at the frequency of 20 GHz. A convolutional neural network is demonstrated on the processor, which achieves an accuracy of 97.9 percent on action recognition. ",

In most systems experimentally investigated to date, skyrmions emerge as classical objects. However, the discovery of skyrmions with nanometer length scales has sparked interest in their quantum properties. Quantum corrections to the classical magnetic textures have already been considered in the semiclassical regime. Here, we go beyond this limit by investigating quantum skyrmions in the deep quantum regime. We use density matrix renormalization group techniques to study two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and discover a broad region in the zero temperature phase diagram which hosts quantum skyrmion lattice ground states. We argue that this novel quantum skyrmion phase can be detected experimentally in the magnetization profile via local magnetic polarization measurements as well as in the spin structure factor measurable via neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we explore the resulting quantum skyrmion state, analyze its real space polarization profile and show that it is a non-classical state featuring entanglement between quasiparticle and environment mainly localized near the boundary spins of the skyrmion.
