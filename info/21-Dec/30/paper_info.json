    "title": "Dynamics and stability conditions of semiconductor lasers under external  optical feedback from both sides of the laser cavity",
    "abstract": "To increase the spectral efficiency of coherent communication systems, lasers with ever-narrower linewidths are required as they enable higher-order modulation formats with lower bit-error rates. In particular, semiconductor lasers are a key component due to their compactness, low power consumption, and potential for mass production. In field-testing scenarios their output is coupled to a fiber, making them susceptible to external optical feedback (EOF). This has a detrimental effect on its stability, thus it is traditionally countered by employing, for example, optical isolators and angled output waveguides. In this work, EOF is explored in a novel way with the aim to reduce and stabilize the laser linewidth. EOF has been traditionally studied in the case where it is applied to only one side of the laser cavity. In contrast, this work gives a generalization to the case of feedback on both sides. It is implemented using photonic components available via generic foundry platforms, thus creating a path towards devices with high technology-readiness level. Numerical results shows an improvement in performance of the double-feedback case with respect to the single-feedback case. In particularly, by appropriately selecting the phase of the feedback from both sides, a broad stability regime is discovered. This work paves the way towards low-cost, integrated and stable narrow-linewidth integrated lasers. ",

    "title": "Connecting steady-states of driven-dissipative photonic lattices with  spontaneous collective emission phenomena",
    "abstract": "Recent experimental advances enable the fabrication of photonic lattices in which the light propagates with non-trivial energy dispersions. When interfaced with quantum emitters, such systems yield strong collective spontaneous emission phenomena, such as perfect sub-radiance, in which the decay into the bath is completely suppressed, forming bound-states-in-the-continuum. Since such photonic lattices are generally lossy, an alternative way of probing them consists in coherently driving them to an steady-state from which photoluminescence can be extracted. Here, we formalize connections between these two seemingly different situations and use that intuition to predict the formation of non-trivial photonic steady-states in one and two dimensions. In particular, we show that subradiant emitter configurations are linked to the emergence of steady-state light-localization in the driven-dissipative setting, in which the light features the same form than the spontaneously formed bound-states-in-the-continuum. Besides, we also find configurations which leads to the opposite behaviour, an anti-localization of light, that is, it distributes over all the system except for the region defined between the driving lasers. These results shed light on the recently reported optically-defined cavities in polaritonic lattices, and can guide further experimental studies. ",

We then design a two-dimensional version of higher-order topological insulators (HOTI), by such rotation in a triangular photonic lattice with $\\mathcal{C}_3$ symmetry. This HOTI supports the hallmark zero-dimensional corner states and simultaneously the one-dimensional edge states. We also find that our photonic corner states carry chiral orbital angular momenta locked by valleys, whose wavefunctions are featured by the phase vortex (singularity) positioned at the maximal Wyckoff points. Moreover, when excited by a fired source with various frequencies, the valley topological states of both one-dimensional edges and zero-dimensional corners emerge simultaneously. Extendable to higher or synthetic dimensions, our work provides access to a chiral vortex platform for HOTI realisations in the THz photonic system. ",

    "abstract": "Active plasma resonance spectroscopy (APRS) refers to a class of plasma diagnostic methods that use the ability of plasma to resonate at or near the electron plasma frequency for diagnostic purposes. The planar multipole resonance probe (pMRP) is an optimized realization of APRS. It has a non-invasive structure and allows simultaneous measurement of electron density, electron temperature, and electron-neutral collision frequency. Previous work has investigated the pMRP through the Drude model and collision-less kinetic model. The Drude model misses important kinetic effects such as collision-less kinetic damping. The collision-less kinetic model is able to capture pure kinetic effects. However, it is only applicable to the low-pressure plasma. To further study the behavior of the pMRP, we develop a collisional kinetic model in this paper, which applies to arbitrary pressure. In this model, the kinetic equation is coupled to the Poisson equation under the electrostatic approximation. The real part of the general admittance is calculated to describe the spectral response of the probe-plasma system. Both collision-less kinetic damping and collisional damping appear in the spectrum. This model provides a possibility to calculate the electron density, electron temperature, and electron-neutral collision frequency from the measurements. ",

    "abstract": "Optical-frequency synthesizers are lasers stabilized and programmed from a microwave clock for applications, especially in fundamental measurements and spectroscopy, optical-communication links, and precision sensing of numerous physical effects. In a synthesizer, a frequency comb provides a reference grid across a broad spectrum and a frequency-tunable laser accomplishes synthesis by phase-lock to the comb. Optical synthesizers have matured to chip-scale with integrated photonics, however, the tunable laser and frequency comb fundamentally constrain the tuning range. Here, we present an optical synthesizer based on four-wave mixing (FWM) spectral translation of a tunable laser and a frequency comb. We implement both the spectral translation and the frequency comb by use of advanced microresonators. The intrinsic energy conservation of FWM ensures deterministic optical synthesis, and it allows a nearly arbitrary frequency tuning range by the dependence of resonant FWM on group-velocity dispersion, temperature, and tunable laser frequency. Moreover, we take advantage of highly efficient parametric amplification associated with spectral translation. We operate spectral translation across output ranges up to 200 THz, and we characterize it through ultraprecise optical-frequency metrology, demonstrating <0.1 Hz absolute accuracy and a fractional frequency precision of 4.7x10^(-13) in 1 s measurements. Our experiments introduce integrated-nonlinear-photonic circuits that enable complex intrinsic functionalities, such as our approach to optical-frequency synthesis with nearly limitless bandwidth. ",

Not only is classical transport capable of moving trajectories away from the core, but it can also furnish ionization probabilities of the same order as the quantum ones for intensities currently employed in experiments.

Devices with SiO2 upper cladding layer show strong tolerance to irradiation. Neutron irradiation leads to slight changes in the crystal symmetry in the Si cores of the optical devices and accelerated oxidization for devices without SiO2 cladding.

Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all-electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance (ESR), which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically-precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic scale.

The presence of this potential energy in quantum electrodynamics is at odds with the apparent absence of potential energy in classical electrodynamics. Although electrostatics permits the interpretation of electric energy either as potential energy possessed by matter or as energy possessed by the electric field, electrodynamics does not have the same freedom. We must attribute energy to the electromagnetic field if energy is to be conserved. Still, this does not rule out the possibility that, in addition to electromagnetic field energy, there is also electromagnetic potential energy possessed by matter. Indeed, if we take the matter to be represented by the Dirac field (in a classical precursor to quantum electrodynamics), then the symmetric energy-momentum tensor of matter contains potential energy.
