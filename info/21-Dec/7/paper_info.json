    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel high order explicit time discretization method for the acoustic wave equation with discontinuous coefficients. The space discretization is based on the unfitted finite element method in the discontinuous Galerkin framework which allows us to treat problems with complex interface geometry on Cartesian meshes. The strong stability and optimal $hp$-version error estimates both in time and space are established. Numerical examples confirm our theoretical results. ",

    "abstract": "We present regression and compression algorithms for lattice QCD data utilizing the efficient binary optimization ability of quantum annealers. In the regression algorithm, we encode the correlation between the input and output variables into a sparse coding machine learning algorithm. The trained correlation pattern is used to predict lattice QCD observables of unseen lattice configurations from other observables measured on the lattice. In the compression algorithm, we define a mapping from lattice QCD data of floating-point numbers to the binary coefficients that closely reconstruct the input data from a set of basis vectors. Since the reconstruction is not exact, the mapping defines a lossy compression, but, a reasonably small number of binary coefficients are able to reconstruct the input vector of lattice QCD data with the reconstruction error much smaller than the statistical fluctuation. In both applications, we use D-Wave quantum annealers to solve the NP-hard binary optimization problems of the machine learning algorithms. ",
