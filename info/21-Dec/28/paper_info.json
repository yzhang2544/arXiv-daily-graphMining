    "abstract": "We introduce an electronic structure based representation for quantum machine learning (QML) of electronic properties throughout chemical compound space. The representation is constructed using computationally inexpensive ab initio calculations and explicitly accounts for changes in the electronic structure. We demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of resulting QML models when applied to property labels such as total potential energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, ionization potential, and electron affinity, using as data sets for training and testing entries from the QM7b, QM7b-T, QM9, and LIBE libraries. For the latter, we also demonstrate the ability of this approach to account for molecular species of different charge and spin multiplicity, resulting in QML models that infer total potential energies based on geometry, charge, and spin as input.

    "abstract": "The development of efficient sources of single photons and entangled photon pairs emitting in the low-loss wavelength region around 1550 nm is crucial for long-distance quantum communication. Moreover, direct fiber coupling and electrical carrier injection are highly desirable for deployment in compact and user-friendly systems integrated with the existing fiber infrastructure. Here we present a detailed design study of circular Bragg gratings etched in InP slabs and operating in the telecom C-band. These devices enable the simultaneous enhancement of the X and XX spectral lines, with collection efficiency in NA=0.65 close to 90% for the wavelength range 1520-1580 nm and Purcell factor up to 15. We also investigate the coupling into SM fiber, which exceeds 70% in UHNA4. Finally, we propose a modified device design directly compatible with electrical carrier injection, reporting Purcell factors up to 20 and collection efficiency in NA=0.65 close to 70% for the whole telecom C-band.

The manufacturing quality is demonstrated with white-light interferometric data and microscope imaging. Neutron scattering experiment results are presented, showing agreement to refraction modelling.

A fluid model is used to obtain the DR for electrostatic wave and the right and the left circularly polarized electromagnetic waves with all relativistic effects included. This dispersion relation is solved numerically to investigation the unstable coupling among all waves. When the transverse velocity is small, only the FEL instability is found.

    "abstract": "Topological systems furnish a powerful way of localizing wave energy at edges of a structured material. Usually this relies on Bragg scattering to obtain bandgaps with nontrivial topological structures. However, this limits their applicability to low frequencies since that would require very large structures. A standard approach to address the problem is to add resonating elements inside the material to open gaps in the subwavelength regime. Unfortunately, one usually has no precise control on the properties of the obtained topological modes, such as their frequency or localization length. In this work, we propose a new construction to couple acoustic resonators such that acoustic modes are mapped exactly to the eigenmodes of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The relation between energy in the lattice model and the acoustic frequency is controlled by the characteristics of the resonators. This allows us to obtain Su-Schrieffer-Heeger topological modes at any given frequency, for instance in the subwavelength regime. We also generalize the construction to obtain well-controlled topological edge modes in alternative tunable configurations. ",

To increase the spectral efficiency of FSO links, transmission over spatial division multiplexing (SDM) can be exploited, where orthogonal light beams have to be shaped according to suitable amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles. In this work, we show that a programmable photonic circuits, consisting of a silicon photonic mesh of tunable Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) can be used as an adaptive multibeam receiver for a FSO communication link. The circuit can self-configure to simultaneously receive and separate, with negligible mutual crosstalk, signals carried by orthogonal FSO beams sharing the same wavelength and polarization. This feature is demonstrated on signal pairs either arriving at the receiver from orthogonal directions (direction-diversity) or being shaped according to different orthogonal spatial modes (mode-diversity), even in the presence of some mixing during propagation. The performance of programmable mesh as an adaptive multibeam receiver is assessed by means of data channel transmission at 10 Gbit/s a wavelength of 1550 nm, but the optical bandwidth of the receiver (>40 nm) allows its use at much higher data rates as well as in wavelength-division multiplexing SDM communication links.

    "abstract": "A highly efficient on-chip acousto-optic modulator, as a key component, occupies an exceptional position in microwave-to-optical conversion. Homogeneous thin-film lithium niobate is preferentially employed to build the suspended configuration forming the acoustic resonant cavity to improve the modulation efficiency of the device. However, the limited cavity length and complex fabrication recipe of the suspended prototype restrain further breakthrough in the modulation efficiency and impose challenges for waveguide fabrication. In this work, based on a nonsuspended thin-film lithium niobate-chalcogenide glass hybrid Mach-Zehnder interferometer waveguide platform, we propose and demonstrate a built-in push-pull acousto-optic modulator with a half-wave-voltage-length product as low as 0.03 V cm, presenting a modulation efficiency comparable to that of the state-of-the-art suspended counterpart. Based on the advantage of low power consumption, a microwave modulation link is demonstrated using our developed built-in push-pull acousto-optic modulator. The nontrivial acousto-optic modulation performance benefits from the superior photoelastic property of the chalcogenide membrane and the completely bidirectional participation of the antisymmetric Rayleigh surface acoustic wave mode excited by the impedance-matched interdigital transducer, overcoming the issue of amplitude differences of surface acoustic waves applied to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer two arms in traditional push-pull acousto-optic modulators.

These states have been explored in various systems where their emergence is either guaranteed by crystallographic symmetries or due to topological protection.

Here, we propose a new generic mechanism to realize bound states in the continuum that exist by first principles free of other resonances and are robust upon parameter tuning. The mechanism is based on the fundamental band in double-net metamaterials, which provides vanishing homogenized electromagnetic fields. We predict two new types of bound states in the continuum: i) generic modes confined to the metamaterial bulk, mimicking electronic acoustic waves in a hydrodynamic double plasma, and ii) topological surface bound states in the continuum.

It is assumed that the two hard X-ray photons emitted from an astrophysical source are scattered on a free electron and converted into a single soft photon of optical range. Using QED S-matrix formalism for the derivation of a cross-section of direct double Compton (DDC) and assuming detailed balance conditions we give an analytical expression for the cross-section of the IDC process. It is shown that at fixed energies of incident photons the inverse cross-section has no infra-red divergences and its behavior is completely defined by the spectral characteristics of the photon source itself, in particular, by the finite interaction time of radiation with an electron. Thus, even for the direct process, the problem of resolving infrared divergence actually refers to a real physical source of radiation in which photons are never actually plane waves. As a result the physical frequency profile of the scattered radiation for direct as well as inverse double Compton processes is a function of both the intensity and line shape of the incident photon field.

We find that the optimal bounded controls acquire the bang-interior and interior-bang form, with the bang part corresponding to the maximum allowed control value and the interior part to values between zero and the maximum. Then, we use numerical optimal control to obtain the switching times and the interior control values. We compare our results with those obtained using Gaussian STIRAP pulses, and find that the optimal method performs better, with the extent of improvement depending on the effective two-photon detuning and the size of incoherent losses. When we consider effective two-photon resonance, the improvement is more dramatic for larger incoherent losses, while when we take into account the effective two-photon detuning, the improvement is better for smaller incoherent losses. We also obtain how the transfer efficiency increases with increasing absolute value of the Fano factor. The present work is expected to find application in areas where the population transfer between two bound states through a continuum structure plays an important role, for example coherence effects, like population trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency, optical analogs for light waves propagating in waveguide-based photonic structures, and qubits coupled via a continuum of bosonic or waveguide modes.
