    "abstract": "We design a Multi-Transverse-Mode Optical Processor (MTMOP) on 220 nm thick Silicon Photonics exploiting the first two quasi-transverse electric modes (TE0 and TE1). The objective is to measure the optical phase, required for programming the optical processor, without use of conventional optical phase detection techniques (e.g., coherent detection). In the proposed design, we use a novel but simple building block that converts the optical phase to optical power. Mode TE0 carries the main optical signal while mode TE1 is for programming purposes. The MTMOP operation relies on the fact that the group velocity of TE0 and TE1 propagating through a mode-sensitive phase shifter are different. An unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) consists of a mode-sensitive and mode-insensitive phase shifters in the two arms. We set the bias of the phase shifters so that TE0 propagating in the two arms constructively interfere while this will not be the case for TE1. Hence, we detect the phase shift applied to TE0 by measuring the variation in the optical power of TE1. To the best of our knowledge, this design is the first attempt towards realizing a programmable optical processor with fully integrated programming unit exploiting multimode silicon photonics. ",

    "abstract": "Atomic devices such as atomic clocks and optically-pumped magnetometers rely on the interrogation of atoms contained in a cell whose inner content has to meet high standards of purity and accuracy. Glass-blowing techniques and craftsmanship have evolved over many decades to achieve such standards in macroscopic vapor cells. With the emergence of chip-scale atomic devices, the need for miniaturization and mass fabrication has led to the adoption of microfabrication techniques to make millimeter-scale vapor cells. However, many shortcomings remain and no process has been able to match the quality and versatility of glass-blown cells. Here, we introduce a novel approach to structure, fill and seal microfabricated vapor cells inspired from the century-old approach of glass-blowing. In particular we demonstrate opening and closing single-use zero-leak microfabricated valves, actuated exclusively by laser, and operating in the same way as the \"make-seals\" and \"break-seals\" found in the filling apparatus of traditional cells. Such structures are employed to fill cesium vapor cells at the wafer-level. The make-seal structure consists of a glass membrane that can be locally heated and deflected to seal a microchannel. The break-seal is obtained by breaching a silicon wall between cavities. This new approach allows adapting processes previously restricted to glass-blown cells. It can also be extended to vacuum microelectronics and vacuum-packaging of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices. ",

Let us consider an example from X-ray science. Nanoscale X-ray imaging is a crucial tool to enable a wide range of scientific explorations from materials science and biology to mechanical and civil engineering. The next-generation light sources will increase the X-ray beam brightness and coherent flux by 100 to 1,000 times. In order to image larger samples, the continuous frame rate of pixel array detectors must be increased, approaching 1 MHz, which requires several Tbps (aggregated) to transfer pixel data out to a data acquisition system. Using 65-nm CMOS technology, an optimistic raw data rate off such a chip is about 100-200 Gbps. However, a continuous 1 MHz detector with only $256 \\times 256$ pixels at 16-bit resolution, for example, will require 1,000 Gbps (i.e., 1 Tbps) bandwidth off the chip! It is impractical to have multiple high-speed transceivers running in parallel to provide such bandwidth and represents the first data bottleneck. New approaches are necessary to reduce the data size by performing data compression or AI-based feature extraction directly inside a detector silicon chip in a streaming manner before sending it off-chip.

The physical and chemical protection of the CSS layer could lead to reducing the mutual impact between analyte molecules and metal nanostructures. RPE plate was realized just by sputtering and chemical immersion processes, resulting in high productivity. We found a significant enhancement on the order of 10$^7$-fold for Raman scattering and 10$^2$-fold for fluorescence by RPE even without the proximity of metal nanostructures and analyte molecules. We confirmed the feasibility of RPE for biophotonic analysis. RPE worked for dye molecules in cells cultured on the CSS layer, enabling the enhanced fluorescence biosensing of intracellular signaling dynamics in HeLa cells. RPE also worked for biological tissues, enhancing Raman histological imaging of esophagus tissues with esophageal adventitia of a Wistar rat attached atop the CSS layer. We also investigated the wavelength dependency of RPE on the on- or off-resonant with the dye molecular transition dipoles with various molecular concentrations. The results suggested that the RPE occurred by remote resonant coupling between the localized surface plasmon of AgNIs and the molecular transition dipole of the analyte via the CSS structure. The RPE plate affords practical advantages for potential biophotonic analyses such as high productivity and biocompatibility. We thus anticipate that RPE will advance to versatile analytical tools in chemistry, biology, and medicine. ",

So far, the main approach for various optical manipulations has been the geometric design of the irradiated light, such as optical vortices and localized surface plasmons. On the other hand, luminescence from materials should also act as optical force, which we call luminescence-induced optical force (LiOF). LiOF occurs by designing an anisotropic dielectric environment surrounding an isotropic emitter. In this paper, as a model, we assumed a Fabry-Perot cavity structure in which a luminescent nanofilm is placed parallel to a metallic mirror. Then, we theoretically calculated the LiOF and revealed that the LiOF could drive the vibrational motion of the film. This mechanism will provide new insights into developing unconventional optomechanics. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive method for measuring magnetic flux signals caused by brain activity using sensor arrays located on or above the scalp. A common strategy for monitoring brain activity is to place sensors on a nearly uniform grid, or sensor array, around the head. By increasing the total number of sensors, higher spatial-frequency components of brain activity can be resolved as dictated by Nyquist sampling theory. Currently, there are few principled mathematical architectures for sensor placement aside from Nyquist considerations. However, global brain activity often exhibits low-dimensional patterns of spatio-temporal dynamics. The low-dimensional global patterns can be computed from the singular value decomposition and can be leveraged to select a small number of sensors optimized for reconstructing brain signals and localizing brain sources. Moreover, a smaller number of sensors which are systematically chosen can outperform the entire sensor array when considering noisy measurements. We propose a greedy selection algorithm based upon the QR decomposition that is computationally efficient to implement for MEG. We demonstrate the performance of the sensor selection algorithm for the tasks of signal reconstruction and localization. The performance is dependent upon source localization, with shallow sources easily identified and reconstructed, and deep sources more difficult to locate. Our findings suggest that principled methods for sensor selection can improve MEG capabilities and potentially add cost savings for monitoring brain-wide activity. ",

The minimum detectable electric field of 132 uV/cm (9.72 s detection) is realized in our system. With this atomic receiver, the phase-sensitive conversion of amplitude-modulated or frequency-modulated terahertz waves into optical signals is performed to realize the wireless communications with 8-state phase-shift-keying. The experimental results show that the atomic receiver has many advantages due to its quantum properties. Especially, the communications distance has the potential to be over 18 km. Furthermore, the atomic receiver can be used in the terahertz wireless-fiber link to directly convert the wireless signals into optical signals.

These integrated systems can be deployed over significantly longer distances, may be used in conjunction with live telecommunications, and can be significantly cheaper. However, they provide only a single time series representing strain over the entire length of fiber.

We investigate the quantum pathway interference visibility over an almost octave-spanning wavelength range of the fundamental femtosecond laser pulses and their second-harmonic. The photoemission shows a high visibility of 90% +/- 5%, with a remarkably constant distribution. Furthermore, by varying the relative intensity ratio of the two colors, we find that we can vary the visibility between 0 and close to 100%. A simple but highly insightful theoretical model allows us to explain all observations, with excellent quantitative agreements. We expect this work to be universal to all kinds of photo-driven quantum interference, including quantum control in physics, chemistry and quantum engineering. ",

These degrees of freedom also constitute the primary environments leading to dissipative effects in molecular quantum systems, but inclusion of functional signalling mediated by environments has not been widely studied in open quantum systems. Here we present an allostery-inspired quantum mechanical model where reversible quantum state transitions and environmental energy harvesting are both triggered and controlled by the environmental dynamics induced by a remote two-level system. By employing numerically exact methods based on matrix product state representations of the entire system-environment wave function, we directly demonstrate how the non-perturbative, non-Markovian nature of these dissipative dynamics reproduce a range of features known in biological allostery, potentially opening a path for the exploitation of dissipative signalling in future quantum technologies and nanomaterials.

In the RBM optimization, a zero-temperature quantum state is mapped onto a finite-temperature classical state of the extended Ising spins that constitute the RBM. We find that the quantum phase transition from the ordered phase to the disordered phase in the 1D TFI model by increasing the transverse field is clearly reflected in the behaviors of the optimized RBM parameters and hence in the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical RBM Ising system. The present finding of a correspondence between the neural-network parameters and quantum phases suggests that a careful investigation of the neural-network parameters may provide a new route to extracting nontrivial physical insights from the neural-network wave functions.

For heart attack patients, it is crucial to facilitate the decision of appropriate therapy by analyzing and quantifying their LGE CMR images. To achieve accurate quantification, LGE CMR images need to be processed in two steps: segmentation of the myocardium followed by classification of infarcts within the segmented myocardium. However, automatic segmentation is difficult usually due to the intensity heterogeneity of the myocardium and intensity similarity between the infarcts and blood pool. Besides, the slices of an LGE CMR dataset often suffer from spatial and intensity distortions, causing further difficulties in segmentation and classification. In this paper, we present a comprehensive 3-D framework for automatic quantification of LGE CMR images. In this framework, myocardium is segmented with a novel method that deforms coupled endocardial and epicardial meshes and combines information in both short- and long-axis slices, while infarcts are classified with a graph-cut algorithm incorporating intensity and spatial information. Moreover, both spatial and intensity distortions are effectively corrected with specially designed countermeasures. Experiments with 20 sets of real patient data show visually good segmentation and classification results that are quantitatively in strong agreement with those manually obtained by experts. ",
