    "abstract": "We theoretically and experimentally investigate the formation of dissipative coherent structures in Kerr nonlinear optical microresonators, whose integrated dispersion exceeds the free-spectral range. We demonstrate that the presence of any periodic modulation along the resonator's circumference, such as periodically varying dispersion, can excite higher-order comb structures. We explore the outcomes of coherent microcomb generation in both cases of anomalous and normal dispersion. We are able to access this regime in microresonators via the high peak power of synchronous pulse-driving. For solitons in anomalous dispersion, we observe the formation of higher-order phase-matched dispersive waves (`Kelly-like' sidebands), where the folded dispersion crosses the frequency comb grid. In normal dispersion, we see the coexistence of switching wave fronts with Faraday instability-induced period-doubling patterns, manifesting as powerful satellite microcombs highly separated either side of the core microcomb while sharing the same repetition rate. This regime of dispersion-modulated phase matching opens a dimension of Kerr cavity physics and microcomb generation, particularly for the spectral extension and tuneability of microcombs in normal dispersion.

    "abstract": "Complete dissociation dynamics of low-energy electron attachment to carbon disulfide have been studied using the velocity slice imaging (VSI) technique. The ion yields of S- and CS- fragment ions as the function of incident electron energy in the range 5 to 11 eV have been obtained. Two resonances for S- ions at around 6.2 eV and 7.7 eV and only one resonance for CS- ions at around 6.2 eV have been obtained in this energy range. The kinetic energy and the angular distributions of these fragment negative ions at different incident electron energies around these resonances have been measured. From the angular distribution of these fragment anions, we have found that the bending of the temporary negative ions causes a significant change in the angular distribution from the expected one. ",

The ion cloud has a layered structure of these ion bunches with different energies. The divergences of the ion bunch in the laser inclination direction and perpendicular to it are different in an oblique incidence laser. This indicates that the smaller the spot diameter of the laser pulse, the larger the divergence of the ion beam. In addition, theoretical formulas for the radius of the generated ion beam and the energy spectrum are derived, and they are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation results. ",

We prove that spin-momentum locking is a property that emerges from the geometry of the unit cell and does not require global rotation symmetries. We theoretically find, and confirm with Mueller polarimetry measurements, that spin-momentum locking is an approximate symmetry. The breakdown is ascribed to the elliptical projection of circularly polarized light into the planar surface and is maximal when surface waves are excited. ",

Here we review the recent advances in optical skyrmions within a unified framework. Starting from fundamental theories, including classification of skyrmionic states, we describe generation and topological control of different kinds of optical skyrmions in structured and time-dependent optical fields. We further highlight generalized classes of optical topological quasiparticles beyond skyrmions and outline the emerging applications, future trends, and open challenges. A complex vectorial field structure of optical quasiparticles with versatile topological characteristics emerges as an important feature in modern spin-optics, imaging and metrology, optical forces, structured light and topological and quantum technologies.

Whereas the ferromagnetic layer acts as a magnetic cavity, all metal layers control the frequencies and eigenmodes of acoustic vibrations. The here proposed design allows for achieving and tuning the spectral and spatial modes overlap between phonons and magnons that results in their strong resonant interaction. Realistic simulations for gold-nickel multilayers show that sweeping the external magnetic field should allow for observing resonantly enhanced interactions between individual magnon and phonon modes in a broad range of frequencies spanning from tens of GHz up to several hundreds of GHz, which can be finely tuned through the multilayer design. Our results would enable the systematic study and the deep understanding of resonantly enhanced magneto-elastic coupling between individual phonon and magnon modes up to frequencies of great contemporary fundamental and applied interest.

Next to optical quantum memories, most quantum repeater architectures also require multiplexed sources of entangled photon pairs, as well as photon detection that can distinguish between the multiplexed modes. We demonstrate the generation and characterization of frequency multiplexed photon pairs by employing cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal and a virtually-imaged phase array that allows mapping of spectral modes onto distinct spatial modes. Through coincidence measurements, we demonstrate non-classical correlations between energy-correlated photon pairs and a strong reduction of correlations between the non-correlated photons. Our investigation demonstrates that both our photon-pair source and the detection setup are suitable for creating a frequency multiplexed quantum repeater. ",

    "abstract": "The distribution of entanglement via satellite links will drastically extend the reach of quantum networks. Highly efficient entangled photon sources are an essential requirement towards overcoming high channel loss and achieving practical transmission rates in long-distance satellite downlinks. Here we report on an ultrabright entangled photon source that is optimized for long-distance free-space transmission. It operates in a wavelength range that is efficiently detected with space-ready single photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), and readily provides pair emission rates that exceed the detector bandwidth (i.e., the temporal resolution). To overcome this limitation, we demultiplex the photon flux into wavelength channels that can be handled by current single photon detector technology. This is achieved efficiently by using the spectral correlations due to hyper-entanglement in polarization and frequency as an auxiliary resource. Combined with recent demonstrations of space-proof source prototypes, these results pave the way to a broadband long-distance entanglement distribution network based on satellites. ",
