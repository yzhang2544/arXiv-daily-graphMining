We introduce the technique of Fourier transform chronometry, where the temporal envelope is acquired by measuring the frequency autocorrelation of the optical field in a linear interferometer. We apply our technique, which is the time-frequency conjugate measurement to Fourier-transform spectrometry, to experimentally measure the pulse envelope of classical and single photon light pulses.

    "abstract": "Optical control of polyatomic molecules promises new opportunities in precision metrology, fundamental chemistry, quantum information, and many-body science. Contemporary experimental and theoretical efforts have mostly focused on cycling photons via excitation of a single electron localized to an alkaline earth (group 2)-like metal center. In this manuscript, we consider pathways towards optical cycling in polyatomic molecules with multi-electron degrees of freedom, which arise from two or more cycling electrons localized to $p$-block post-transition metal and metalloid (group 13, 14, and 15) centers. We characterize the electronic structure and rovibrational branching of several prototypical candidates using ab initio quantum chemical methods. Despite increased internal complexity and challenging design parameters, we find several molecules possessing quasi-closed photon cycling schemes with highly diagonal, visible and near-infrared transitions. Furthermore, we identify new heuristics for engineering optically controllable and laser-coolable polyatomic molecules with multi-electron cycling centers. Our results help elucidate the interplay between hybridization, repulsion, and ionicity in optically active species and provide a first step towards using polyatomic molecules with complex electronic structure as a resource for quantum science and measurement.

    "title": "Resolution Limits of Resonant Sensors with Duffing Non-Linearity",
    "abstract": "The resolution of resonant sensors is fundamentally limited by the presence of noise. Thermomechanical noise, intrinsic to the resonator, sets the ultimate sensor performance when all other noise sources have been eliminated. For linear resonators, the sensing resolution can always be further improved by increasing the driving power. However, this trend cannot continue indefinitely, since at sufficiently high driving powers non-linear effects emerge and influence the noise performance. As a consequence, the resonator's non-linear characteristics play an inextricable role in determining its ultimate resolution limits. Recently, several works have studied the characteristic performance of non-linear resonators as sensors, with the counter intuitive conclusion that increasing the quality factor of a resonator does not improve its sensing resolution at the thermomechanical limit. In this work we further analyze the ultimate resolution limits, and describe different regimes of performance at integration times below and above the resonator's decay time. We provide an analytical model to elucidate the effects of Duffing non-linearity on the resolution of closed-loop sensors, and validate it using numerical simulations. In contrast to previous works, our model and simulations show that under certain conditions the ultimate sensing resolution of a Duffing resonator can be improved by maximizing its quality factor. With measurements on a nanomechanical membrane resonator, we experimentally verify the model and demonstrate that frequency resolutions can be achieved that surpass the previously known limits. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic reconfiguration of optical filters is the key to novel flexible RF photonic receivers and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Although silicon photonics (SiP) is a promising technology platform to realize such receivers, process variations and lack of in-situ tuning capability limits the adoption of SiP filters in widely-tunable RF photonic receivers. To address this issue, this work presents a first `in-situ' automatic reconfiguration algorithm and demonstrates a software configurable integrated optical filter that can be reconfigured on-the-fly based on user specifications. The presented reconfiguration scheme avoids the use of expensive and bulky equipment such as Optical Vector Network Analyzer (OVNA), does not use simulation data for reconfiguration, reduces the total number of thermo-optic tuning elements required and eliminates several time consuming configuration steps as in the prior art. This makes this filter ideal in a real world scenario where user specifies the filter center frequency, bandwidth, required rejection & filter type (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) and the filter is automatically configured regardless of process, voltage & temperature (PVT) variations. We fabricated our design in AIM Photonics' Active SiP process and have demonstrated our reconfiguration algorithm for a second-order filter with 3dB bandwidth of 3 GHz, 2.2 dB insertion loss and >30 dB out-of-band rejection using only two reference laser wavelength settings. Since the filter photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is fabricated using a CMOS-compatible SiP foundry, the design is manufacturable with repeatable and scalable performance suited for its integration with electronics to realize complex chip-scale RF photonic systems.

    "abstract": "A new injection scheme using the interference of two coaxial laser pulses is proposed for generating high quality beams in laser wakefield accelerators. In this scheme, a relatively loosely focused laser pulse drives the plasma wakefield, and a tightly focused laser pulse with similar intensity triggers interference ring pattern which creates onion-like multi sheaths in the plasma wakefield. Due to the wavefront curvature change after the focal position of the tightly focused laser, the innermost sheath of the wakefield expands, which slows down the effective phase velocity of the wakefield and triggers injection of plasma electrons. Particle-in-cell simulations show that high quality electron beams with low energy spread (a few per mill), high charge (hundred picocoulomb) and small emittance (sub millimeter milliradian) at the same time can be generated using moderate laser parameters for properly chosen phase differences between the two lasers.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the major role funneling dynamics plays in light-harvesting processes, we built some laser control strategies inspired from basic mechanisms such as interference and kicks, and apply them to the case of pyrazine. We are studying the internal conversion between the two excited states, the highest and directly reachable from the initial ground state being considered as a donor, and the lowest as an acceptor. The ultimate control objective is the maximum population deposit in the otherwise dark acceptor, from a two-step process: radiative excitation of the donor, followed by a conical-intersection-mediated funneling towards the acceptor. The overall idea is to first obtain the control field parameters (individual pulses leading frequency and intensity, duration and inter-pulse time delay) for tractable reduced dimensional models basically describing the conical intersection branching space. Once these parameters are optimized, they are fixed and used in full dimensional dynamics describing the electronic population transfer. In the case of pyrazine, the reduced model is 4 dimensional, whereas the full dynamics involve 24 vibrational modes. Within experimentally achievable electromagnetic field requirements, we obtain a robust control with about 60 % of the ground state population deposited in the acceptor state, while about 16 % remains in the donor. Moreover, we anticipate a possible transposition to the control of even larger molecular systems, for which only a small number of normal modes are active, among all the others acting as spectators in the dynamics.

    "abstract": "Using the quasi-equilibrium Helmholtz energy (qHE), defined as the thermodynamic work in a quasi-static process, we investigate the thermal properties of both an isothermal process and a transition process between the adiabatic and isothermal states (adiabatic transition). Here, the work is defined by the change in energy from a steady state to another state under a time-dependent perturbation. In particular, the work for a quasi-static change is regarded as thermodynamic work. We employ a system--bath model that involves time-dependent perturbations for the system and the system--bath interaction. Using the qHE, we evaluate the thermodynamic variables. We then employ the hierarchical equations of motion approach to rigorously evaluate the thermodynamics properties of both the system and the bath. We conduct numerical experiments for a three-stroke heat machine (a Kelvin-Planck cycle). These experiments involve an adiabatic transition field that describes the operation of an adiabatic wall between the system and the bath. Thermodynamic--work diagrams for external fields and their conjugate variables, similar to the $P$--$V$ diagram, are introduced to analyze the work done for the system in the cycle. We find that the thermodynamic efficiency of this machine is zero because the field for the isothermal processes acts as a heat engine, whereas that for the adiabatic wall acts as a refrigerator. This is a numerical manifestation of the Kelvin--Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that it is impossible for any substance to derive mechanical effects from a single heat source.

Recent research efforts have demonstrated the role of optical excitation and intense terahertz (THz) pulses in inducing a polar order and revealing a hidden phase transition in SrTiO3 (STO), respectively. Here we show that the surface of STO crystals at room temperature act as ultrafast sensors that enable sub-picosecond switching through the Kerr effect and multi-ps recording of polar THz intensity with spatial resolution below the diffraction limit through dipole alignment relaxation. The contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution achieved by in the STO sensor are significantly superior to those of present-day near-field THz sensors based on the linear Pockels effect, and more importantly, its ability to remain polarized for several picoseconds opens the door to a new strategy for building an ultrafast space-time THz memory.

    "abstract": "Battery interfaces help govern rate capability, safety/stability, cycle life, and self-discharge, but significant gaps remain in our understanding at atomic length scales that can be exploited to improve interfacial properties. In particular, Li partially plated on copper current collectors, relevant to the anodeless, lithium metal cell which is a holy grail of high density energy battery research, has recently been reported to undergo galvanic corrosion and exhibit short shelf lives. We apply large scale Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to examine the reaction between the electrolyte and Li|Cu junctions coated with thin, uniform electrolyte interphase (SEI) passivating films at two applied voltages. These novel DFT galvanic corrosion simulations show that electrolyte degradation preferentially occurs on Li-plated regions and should lead to thicker SEI films. Our simulations reveal similarities but also fundamental differences between traditional metal localized pitting and Li-corrosion mechanisms. Furthermore, using the recently proposed, highly reactive lithium hydride (LiH) component SEI as example, we distinguish between electrochemical and chemical degradation pathways which are partially responsible for self-discharge, with the chemical pathway found to exhibit slow kinetics. We also predict that electric fields should in general exist across natural SEI components like LiH, and across artificial SEI films like LiI and LiAlO(2) often applied to improve battery cycling. Underlying and unifying these predictions is a framework of DFT voltage/overpotential definitions which we have derived from electrochemistry disciplines like structural metal corrosion studies; our analysis can only be made using the correct electronic voltage definitions.

It only needs a small number of experimental measurements, achieving near optimal sample complexity: in ideal cases, a percent-level precision is obtained with $\\sim 10^3$ measurements independent of system size. Furthermore, the accuracy of our fidelity estimation improves with increasing system size. We numerically demonstrate our protocol for a variety of quantum simulator platforms such as itinerant particles on optical lattices, trapped ions, and Rydberg atoms.
