    "abstract": "Singularities of the Poynting vector field at resonant light scattering by nanoparticles are discussed and classified. It is shown that there are two generic types of them, namely (i) the singularities related to the vanishing of the magnetic (and/or electric) field at the singular points and (ii) the singularities related to the formation of standing waves in the proximity of the singular points. The connection of these types of singularities to the topology of the singular points and the space dimension (3D vs. 2D) is revealed. ",

The tracker system was tested using a positron beam of 200-822 MeV/c, and various tracking methods were examined to optimize spatial precision achievable at these energies. The achieved precision results combined with the intrinsic spatial resolution value obtained for a similar system using 120 GeV protons are used to estimate the tracking performance of electrons in the GeV energy range.

Self-heating at cryogenic temperatures has been reported to be a limiting mechanism for the noise, but cryogenic cooling strategies to mitigate it, for instance using liquid cryogens, have not been evaluated. Here, we report microwave noise measurements of a packaged two-stage HEMT amplifier immersed in normal and superfluid $^4$He baths and in vacuum from 1.6 - 80 K. We find that these liquid cryogens are unable to mitigate the thermal noise associated with self-heating. Considering this finding, we examine the implications for the lower bounds of cryogenic noise performance in HEMTs. Our analysis supports the general design principle for cryogenic HEMTs of maximizing gain at the lowest possible power. ",

The inactive space is treated using a correlated mean-field theory called one-body second-order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (OBMP2), which is derived using the canonical transformation and the cumulant approximation. Employing the downfolding technique, we arrive at the active-space Hamiltonian solved by VQE composing of the bare Hamiltonian and a potential caused by the internal-external interaction. Considering different systems with singlet and doublet ground states, we examine the accuracy in predicting both energy and density matrix (by evaluating dipole moment). Our approach can dramatically outperform the active-space VQE with uncorrelated Hartree-Fock reference due to the dynamical correlation outside the active space. Our framework is general and can be used for different types of UCC ansatz. ",

    "abstract": "Early detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an essential task for public health. The conventional culture-based methods for bacterial colony detection usually take >24 hours to get the final read-out. Here, we demonstrate a bacterial colony-forming-unit (CFU) detection system exploiting a thin-film-transistor (TFT)-based image sensor array that saves ~12 hours compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of this CFU detection system, a lensfree imaging modality was built using the TFT image sensor with a sample field-of-view of ~10 cm^2. Time-lapse images of bacterial colonies cultured on chromogenic agar plates were automatically collected at 5-minute intervals. Two deep neural networks were used to detect and count the growing colonies and identify their species. When blindly tested with 265 colonies of E. coli and other coliform bacteria (i.e., Citrobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae), our system reached an average CFU detection rate of 97.3% at 9 hours of incubation and an average recovery rate of 91.6% at ~12 hours. This TFT-based sensor can be applied to various microbiological detection methods. Due to the large scalability, ultra-large field-of-view, and low cost of the TFT-based image sensors, this platform can be integrated with each agar plate to be tested and disposed of after the automated CFU count. The imaging field-of-view of this platform can be cost-effectively increased to >100 cm^2 to provide a massive throughput for CFU detection using, e.g., roll-to-roll manufacturing of TFTs as used in the flexible display industry.

    "abstract": "Inverse source approaches have shown their relevance for several applications in the past years. They rely on the solution of an ill-posed problem where near-field/current data is reconstructed starting from far-field (or less informative field) information. Standard strategies, including the physically constrained ones using Love conditions, result in linear systems to be pseudoinverted which are still ill-conditioned due to the lack of information from the evanescent fields. In this work we present a generalized pseudoinverse for those problems that allows the inclusion of extra constraints from the evanescent field space, when available. This is obtained by dropping some of the standard Moore-Penrose (MP) requirements and using the resulting degrees of freedom to obtain a generalized pseudoinverse that shows favorable performance in several cases of practical interest.

However, nonparaxial wave propagations in photonic lattices break the paradigm of the quantum-optical analogy. Here, we reveal that nonparaxiality exerts stretched and compressed forces on the energy spectrum in the celebrated Aubry-Andre-Harper model. By exploring the mini-gaps induced by the finite size of the different effects of nonparaxiality, we experimentally present that the expansion of one band gap supports the adiabatic transfer of boundary states while Landau-Zener transition occurs at the narrowing of the other gap, whereas identical transport behaviors are expected for the two gaps under paraxial approximation. Our results not only serve as a foundation of future studies of dynamic state transfer but also inspire applications leveraging nonparaxial transitions as a new degree of freedom. ",

In this conceptual study, we show that a unique separation of atomic layers for simulated data is possible when considering a low acceleration voltage. We also introduce an adaptation for estimating the illuminating probe.

A strong electric field screening effect is observed at low frequencies due to charge noise on the surface. We quantitatively measure its frequency dependence, and overcome this screening by mechanically oscillating the tip for imaging DC fields. Our scanning NV electrometry achieved an AC E-field sensitivity of 26 mV um^(-1) Hz^(-1/2), a DC E-field gradient sensitivity of 2 V um^(-2) Hz^(-1/2), and sub-100 nm resolution limited by the NV-sample distance.

We discover abundant topological edge and corner states emerging in our acoustic systems due to the rich edge and corner boundaries inside the fractals. Interestingly, the numbers of the edge and corner states scale the same as the bulk states with the system size and the exponents coincide with the Hausdorff fractal dimension of the Sierpi\\'nski carpet.

    "abstract": "There are considerable interests in automatic stroke lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance (MR) images in the medical imaging field, as strokes are the main cause of various cerebrovascular diseases. Although deep learning-based models have been proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen sites is difficult due to not only the large intersite discrepancy among different scanners, imaging protocols, and populations but also the variations in stroke lesion shape, size, and location. Thus, we propose a U-net--based segmentation network termed SG-Net to improve unseen site generalization for stroke lesion segmentation on MR images. Specifically, we first propose masked adaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize intersite discrepancies, standardizing input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated style by dynamically learning affine parameters from the input. Then, we leverage a gradient reversal layer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant representation, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction with MAIN. Finally, inspired by the \"pseudosymmetry\" of the human brain, we introduce a simple, yet effective data augmentation technique that can be embedded within SG-Net to double the sample size while halving memory consumption. As a result, stroke lesions from the whole brain can be easily identified within a hemisphere, improving the simplicity of training. Experimental results on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) dataset, which includes MR images from 9 different sites, demonstrate that under the \"leave-one-site-out\" setting, the proposed SG-Net substantially outperforms recently published methods in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons.
