    "title": "The modified fundamental equations of quantum mechanics",
    "abstract": "The Schrodinger equation, Klein-Gordon equation (KGE), and Dirac equation are believed to be the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics. Schrodinger's equation has a defect in that there are no negative kinetic energy (NKE) solutions. Dirac's equation has positive kinetic energy (PKE) and NKE branches. Both branches should have low-momentum, or nonrelativistic, approximations: One is the Schrodinger equation, and the other is the NKE Schrodinger equation. The KGE has two problems: It is an equation of the second time derivative so that the calculated density is not definitely positive, and it is not a Hamiltonian form. To overcome these problems, the equation should be revised as PKE- and NKE-decoupled KGEs. The fundamental equations of quantum mechanics after the modification have at least two merits. They are unitary in that all contain the first time derivative and are symmetric with respect to PKE and NKE. This reflects the symmetry of the PKE and NKE matters, as well as, in the author's opinion, the matter and dark matter of our universe. The problems of one-dimensional step potentials are resolved by utilizing the modified fundamental equations for a nonrelativistic particle. ",

By means of bifurcation and linear stability analysis of the homogeneous solutions, we discriminate distinctive soliton forming mechanisms and corresponding dynamics, depending on pump and signal group velocity dispersions (GVDs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the dynamics of pure quadratic solitons. In addition, we discuss how to extend soliton existing regime and easily access quadratic soliton by introducing modulation instabilities through the adjustment of pump and signal GVDs. Our study will benefit the theoretical cavity design and experimental realization for pure quadratic solitons. ",

A lithographically patterned thin wire at the center of the notch area in the coplanar waveguide realizes a millimeter-scale ODMR detection area (1.5 x 2.0 mm^2) and gigahertz-broadband characteristics with low reflection (about 8%). The ODMR signal intensity in the detection area is quantitatively predictable by numerical simulation. Using this chip device, we demonstrate a uniform ODMR signal intensity over the detection area for cells, tissue, and worms. The present demonstration of a chip-based microwave architecture will enable scalable chip integration of ODMR-based quantum sensing technology into various bioassay platforms. ",

The platform is based on a high-finesse, micrometer-scale fiber Fabry-Perot cavity, which can be widely tuned using piezoelectric positioners. A mechanical resonator can be positioned within the cavity in the object-in-the-middle configuration by a second set of positioners. A high level of stability is achieved without sacrificing either performance or tunability, through the combination of a stiff mechanical design, passive vibration isolation, and an active Pound-Drever-Hall feedback lock incorporating a reconfigurable digital filter. The stability of the cavity length is demonstrated to be better than a few picometers over many hours both at room temperature and at 4 K. ",

    "abstract": "We study non-classical pathways and quantum interference in enhanced ionisation of diatomic molecules in strong laser fields using machine learning techniques. Quantum interference provides a bridge, which facilitates intramolecular population transfer. Its frequency is higher than that of the field, intrinsic to the system and depends on several factors, for instance the state of the initial wavepacket or the internuclear separation. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA), we investigate the effect of multiple parameters at once and find optimal conditions for enhanced ionisation in static fields, and controlled ionisation release for two-colour driving fields. This controlled ionisation manifests itself as a step-like behaviour in the time-dependent autocorrelation function. We explain the features encountered with phase-space arguments, and also establish a hierarchy of parameters for controlling ionisation via phase-space Wigner quasiprobability flows, such as specific coherent superpositions of states, electron localisation and internuclear-distance ranges.

    "abstract": "Quantum cascade laser (QCL) frequency combs have revolutionized mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy by their high brightness and fast temporal resolution, and are a promising technology for fully-integrated and cost-effective sensors. As for other integrated comb sources such as micro-combs and interband cascade laser, QCLs have a comb spacing of several GHz, which is adequate for measurements of wide absorbing structures, typically found in liquid or solid samples. However, high-resolution gas-phase spectra require spectral interleaving and frequency calibration. We developed a frequency calibration scheme for fast interleaved measurements with combs featuring multi-GHz spacing. We then demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy with 600 kHz accuracy in single-shot 54-ms measurements over 40 cm$^{-1}$ using two QCLs at 7.8 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m. This work is an important contribution towards fast fingerprinting of complex molecular mixtures in the MIR. Moreover, the calibration scheme could be used with micro-combs for spectroscopy and ranging, both in comb-swept and comb-calibrated setups. ",

    "abstract": "Spectroscopic x-ray detectors (SXDs) are poised to play a substantial role in the next generation of medical x-ray imaging. Evaluating their performance in terms of the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) requires normalization of the frequency-dependent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by that of an ideal SXD. We provide mathematical expressions of the SNR of ideal SXDs for quantification and detection tasks and tabulate their numeric values for standardized tasks. We propose using standardized RQA-series x-ray spectra. We define ideal SXDs as those that (1) have an infinite number of infinitesimal energy bins, (2) do not distort the incident distribution of x-ray photons in the spatial or energy domains, and (3) do not decrease the frequency-dependent SNR of the incident distribution of x-ray quanta. We derive analytic expressions for the noise power spectrum (NPS) of such ideal detectors for detection and quantification tasks. We tabulate the NPS of ideal SXDs for RQA x-ray spectra for detection and quantification of aluminum, PMMA, iodine, and gadolinium basis materials. Our analysis shows that a single matrix determines the noise power of ideal SXDs in detection and quantification tasks, including basis material decomposition and line-integral estimation for pseudo-mono-energetic imaging. This NPS matrix is determined by the x-ray spectrum incident on the detector and the mass-attenuation coefficients of the set of basis materials. Combining existing tabulated values of the mass-attenuation coefficients of basis materials with standardized RQA x-ray spectra enabled tabulating numeric values of the NPS matrix for selected spectra and tasks. The numeric values and mathematical expressions of the NPS of ideal SXDs reported here can be used to normalize measurements of the frequency-dependent SNR of SXDs for experimental study of the task-dependent DQE.

For miniaturized laser devices, whispering gallery resonator lasers are a well-suited platform, offering low thresholds and small linewidths, however, many realizations suffer from the lack of reliable tuning. Rare-earth ion-doped lithium niobate offers a way to solve this issue. Here we present a single-frequency laser based on a neodymium-doped lithium niobate whispering gallery mode resonator that is tuned via the linear electro-optic effect. Using a special geometry, we suppress higher-order transverse modes and hence ensure single-mode operation. With an applied voltage of just $68\\,$V, we achieve a tuning range of $3.5\\,$GHz. The lasing frequency can also be modulated with a triangular control signal. The freely running system provides a frequency and power stability of better than $\\Delta\\nu =20\\,$MHz and 6%, respectively, for a 30 minute period. This concept is suitable for full integration with existing photonic platforms based on lithium niobate. ",

Implementing $n$-fusion, for $n \\ge 3$, is in principle not much harder than $2$-fusions (Bell-basis measurements) in solid-state qubit memories. If we allow even $3$-fusions at the nodes, we find---by developing a connection to a modified version of the site-bond percolation problem---that despite lossy (hence probabilistic) link-level entanglement generation, and probabilistic success of the fusion measurements at nodes, one can generate entanglement between end parties Alice and Bob at a rate that stays constant as the distance between them increases. We prove that this powerful network property is not possible to attain with any quantum networking protocol built with Bell measurements and multiplexing alone. We also design a two-party quantum key distribution protocol that converts the entangled states shared between two nodes into a shared secret, at a key generation rate that is independent of the distance between the two parties.

    "abstract": "We report on the realization of a long-haul radio frequency (RF) transfer scheme by using multiple-access relay stations (MARSs). The proposed scheme with independent link noise compensation for each fiber sub-link effectively solves the limitation of compensation bandwidth for long-haul transfer. The MARS can have the capability to share the same modulated optical signal for the front and rear fiber sub-links, simplifying the configuration at the repeater station and enabling the transfer system to have the multiple-access capability. At the same time, we for the first time theoretically model the effect of the MARS position on the fractional frequency instability of the fiber-optic RF transfer, demonstrating that the MARS position has little effect on system's performance when the ratio of the front and rear fiber sub-links is around $1:1$. We experimentally demonstrate a 1 GHz signal transfer by using one MARS connecting 260 and 280 km fiber links with the fractional frequency instabilities of less than $5.9\\times10^{-14}$ at 1 s and $8.5\\times10^{-17}$ at 10,000 s at the remote site and of $5.6\\times10^{-14}$ and $6.6\\times10^{-17}$ at the integration times of 1 s and 10,000 s at the MARS. The proposed scalable technique can arbitrarily add the same MARSs in the fiber link, which has great potential in realizing ultra-long-haul RF transfer. ",
