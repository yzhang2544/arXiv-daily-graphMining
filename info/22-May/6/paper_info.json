    "abstract": "In this paper we extend the rank-reduced coupled-cluster formalism to the calculation of non-iterative energy corrections due to quadruple excitations. There are two major components of the proposed formalism. The first is an approximate compression of the quadruple excitation amplitudes using the Tucker format. The second is a modified functional used for evaluation of the corrections which gives exactly the same results for the exact amplitudes, but is less susceptible to errors resulting from the aforementioned compression. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the computational cost of the proposed method scales as the seventh power of the system size. Using reference results for a set of small molecules, the method is calibrated to deliver relative accuracy of a few percent in energy corrections. To illustrate the potential of the theory we calculate the isomerization energy of \\emph{ortho}/\\emph{meta} benzyne (C$_6$H$_4$) and the barrier height for the Cope rearrangement in bullvalene (C$_{10}$H$_{10}$). The method retains a near-black-box nature of the conventional coupled-cluster formalism and depends on only one additional parameter that controls the accuracy. ",

A microwave complex permittivity measurement technique based on a high-quality-factor whispering-gallery-mode resonator with a microfluidic chip allows small amounts of dielectric liquids to be investigated with high accuracy. An existing technique based on a sapphire resonator does not provide for a low-concentration detection limit for substances with low molecular weight. Here, we present an advanced technique based on a quartz dielectric resonator. The detection limit obtained for glucose in water solution was found to be about one order of magnitude lower for the quartz resonator cell than for the sapphire-resonator-based measurement cell. The limit is about or lower than the concentration of glucose in human blood. This fact means that the technique can be used as the sensor for investigations of biological solutions in the microwave range. A study of glucose, lactalbumin, and bovine serum albumin was successfully performed in the Ka -band using the developed sensor. ",

Using legacy optimizers for both applications, the impact of including of OQML based atomic forces on optimization outcome has been explored. Numerical results for randomly sampled small organic query molecules indicate systematic improvement of equilibrium and transition state geometries as training set sizes increase. For geometry optimizations, we have considered 5'989 randomly chosen instances of relaxation paths of 5'500 constitutional isomers (sum formula: C$_7$H$_{10}$O$_2$) from the QM9-database. Using the resulting OQML models with an LBFGS optimizer reproduces the minimum geometry with an RMSD of 0.15\\r{A}. Training on 3812 instances drawn at random from 200 transition state search trajectories from the QMrxn20 data-set, out-of-sample S$_\\mathrm{N}$2 transition state geometries have been obtained using OQML based forces within the QST2 algorithm with an RMSD of 0.3 \\r{A}. For the converged equilibrium and transition state geometries subsequent vibrational normal mode frequency analysis deviates from MP2 reference results on average 39 and 41 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. The number of steps until convergence is typically larger for OQML than for DFT based forces. However, the success rate for reaching convergence increases systematically with training set size, indicating OQML's considerable potential applicability. ",

    "abstract": "We present a design strategy for selecting the effective polarizability distribution for a metasurface aperture needed to form a desired radiation pattern. A metasurface aperture consists of an array of subwavelength metamaterial elements, each of which can be conceptualized as a radiating, polarizable dipole. An ideal polarizability distribution can be determined by using a holographic approach to first obtain the necessary aperture fields, which can then be converted to a polarizability distribution using equivalence principles. To achieve this ideal distribution, the polarizability of each element would need to have unconstrained magnitude and phase; however, for a single, passive, metamaterial resonator the magnitude and phase of the effective polarizability are inextricably linked through the properties of the Lorentzian resonance, with the range of phase values restricted to a span of at most 180 degrees. Here, we introduce a family of mappings from the ideal to the available polarizability distributions, easily visualized by plotting both polarizabilities in the complex plane. Using one of these mappings it is possible to achieve highly optimized beam patterns from a metasurface antenna, despite the inherent resonator limitations. We introduce the mapping technique and provide several specific examples, with numerical simulations used to confirm the design approach. ",

We identify quantum simulation as the most relevant application in this regard and we qualitatively outline different risk trajectories.

One possibility is that it gives rise to gravity. In the optical-mechanical analogy in general relativity, relativistic light deflection is treated as refraction in an optical medium of varying density gradient. We now model the optical medium analogue of spacetime as a real graviton conjugate interlinking all masses. Gravitons in local mass systems are assumed to be organized in coherent quantum states overlapping with those of particles within spacetime structures. With the Hubble redshift, however, gravitons acquire longer wavelengths as they are shifted to less coherent states. Assuming that the momentum and energy lost from gravitons is transferrable to particles, mutual screening by masses then gives rise to an attractive force with a magnitude consistent with gravity. Some possible cosmological implications of the model are discussed. ",

On the other hand and because of the restrictions on the communication systems in these ranges such as power, path losses, and attenuation, the present RF antennas can't be used for millimeter and THz applications. The needed antennas should have low-profile, high-gain, acceptable technology, high efficiency and low cost to compensate for these ranges restrictions. Although there are some antenna designs for millimeter and sub THz ranges through the last decay, the antenna designs in these ranges still under investigation and studies to complete the vision of the proposed designs for the aforementioned applications. Thus, they cannot be carried by the optimum response and efficiency for these applications. This thesis aims to introduce a comprehensive study of the main applications that occupy these ranges of frequencies.

As a result of reduced dimensionality and enhanced anisotropy, the quasi-1D structure gives rise to novel properties and promising applications such as photodetectors. However, it remains an open question whether performance crossover will occur when the channel material is downsized. Here we report on the fabrication and testing of photodetectors based on exfoliated quasi-1D BiSeI thin wires. Compared with the device on bulk crystal, a significantly enhanced photoresponse is observed, which is manifested by a series of performance parameters, including ultrahigh responsivity (7 x 10$^4$ A W$^{-1}$), specific detectivity (2.5 x 10$^{14}$ Jones) and external quantum efficiency (1.8 x 10$^7$%) when $V_{\\textrm {ds}}$ = 3 V, $\\lambda$ = 515 nm and $P$ = 0.01 mW cm$^{-2}$. The conventional photoconductive effect is unlikely to account for such a superior photoresponse, which is ultimately understood in terms of the increased specific surface area and the photogating effect caused by trapping states. This work provides a perspective for the modulation of optoelectronic properties and performance in quasi-1D materials. ",

We present a dilation based algorithm to simulate non-unitary operations using probabilistic quantum computing with only one ancilla qubit. We utilize the singular-value decomposition (SVD) to decompose any general quantum operator into a product of two unitary operators and a diagonal non-unitary operator, which we show can be implemented by a diagonal unitary operator in a 1-qubit dilated space. While dilation techniques increase the number of qubits in the calculation, and thus the gate complexity, our algorithm limits the operations required in the dilated space to a diagonal unitary operator, which has known circuit decompositions. We use this algorithm to prepare random sub-normalized two-level states on a quantum device with high fidelity. Furthermore, we present the accurate non-unitary dynamics of two-level open quantum systems in a dephasing channel and an amplitude damping channel computed on a quantum device. The algorithm presented will be most useful for implementing general non-unitary operations when the SVD can be readily computed, which is the case with most operators in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era.
