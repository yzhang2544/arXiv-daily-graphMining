    "abstract": "The accurate measurement of complex liquid permittivity in a frequency range provides important information on liquid properties in comparison to single frequency permittivity investigations. The multifrequency microwave characterization technique based on a single quartz whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator with a microfluidic chip are proposed, developed, and demonstrated. This technique allows the complex permittivity of small volumes of liquid to be measured at six resonant frequencies in the 30-40 GHz frequency range. The calibration is performed by simulating the measurement cell and by plotting the calibration nomogram charts for all six investigated frequencies. The novel approach is applied in studies of the complex permittivity of the L-lysine in water solutions. The results open up possibilities to investigate the complex permittivity of biological liquids at several frequencies and to further develop the microwave dielectrometry of small liquid volumes in a certain frequency range using the quasi-optical nature of a single high-Q WGM resonator.

    "title": "Sound diffusion with spatiotemporally modulated acoustic metasurfaces",
    "abstract": "Traditional sound diffusers are quasi-random phase gratings attached to reflecting surfaces whose purpose is to augment the spatiotemporal incoherence of the acoustic field scattered from reflective surfaces. This configuration allows one to cover a large reflecting surface by periodically tiling the diffuser unit cells to cover a large area while reducing undesirable specular reflection for incident plane waves. However, the periodic arrangement of the unit cells leads to coherent constructive and destructive interference in the scattered field in some directions which is undesirable for achieving acoustic diffusivity. The spatial uniformity of acoustic energy scattered from conventional diffusers constructed in this way is a fundamental limitation of the traditional approach which is not easily overcome when one wishes to cover large reflecting surfaces. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal modulation of the surface acoustic admittance of an acoustic diffuser as a new approach to improve the sound diffusion. We develop a semi-analytical model that employs Fourier series expansion to determine the scattered sound field from a surface admittance consisting of a quadratic residue diffuser (QRD) design whose individual well admittances are modulated with a traveling wave with modulation frequency, $\\omega_{\\mrm{m}}$, amplitude, $Y_\\mrm{m}$, and a wavenumber that matches the unit cell length, $\\Lambda$. We observe significant improvement in diffusion performance due to the fact that the spatiotemporal modulation scatters sound into additional frequency--wavenumber pairs associated with harmonics of the modulation frequency and their diffraction orders. The semi-analytical model results are verified using time-domain finite element model. ",

    "abstract": "From the earth's crust to the human brain, remitted waves are used for sensing and imaging in a diverse range of diffusive media. Separating the source and detector increases the penetration depth of remitted light, yet rapidly decreases the signal strength, leading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we experimentally and numerically show that wavefront shaping a laser beam incident on a diffusive sample enables an order of magnitude remission enhancement, with a penetration depth of up to 10 transport mean free paths. We develop a theoretical model which predicts the maximal-remission enhancement. Our analysis reveals a significant improvement in the sensitivity of remitted waves, to local changes of absorption deep inside diffusive media. This work illustrates the potential of coherent wavefront control for non-invasive diffuse-wave imaging applications, such as diffuse optical tomography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. ",

    "abstract": "Combined studies on fluorescence quantum yield in coenzymes NADH and FAD in water-methanol, water-ethanol and water-propylene glycol mixtures and on time-resolved fluorescence of the same molecules under excitation at 450 and 355~nm by means of the TCSPC method have been carried out. The dependence of quantum yield in NADH on alcohol concentration was found to be similar in methanol and ethanol and different from that in propylene glycol. The behavior of quantum yield in FAD was found to be almost independent of the type of alcohol and exhibited a dramatic 5--6 times increase with alcohol concentration. A model describing molecular excited state relaxation dynamics in pico- and nanosecond time domain was developed on the basis on the quantum mechanical theory and used for analysis of the experimental results. In particular, the model provided a new insight into the nature of the Decay Associated Spectra (DAS) phenomenon. The analysis of the role of pico- and nanosecond quenching in NADH suggested that the picosecond decay in methanol and ethanol likely does not occur through electron transfer in the stacking configuration of the nicotinamide and adenine moieties, but through other mechanisms. However in propylene glycol the picosecond quenching in NADH depended strongly on propylene glycol concentration and sharp increase of the measured quantum yield was associated with the contribution of both picosecond and nanosecond quenching mechanisms. The picosecond quenching to FAD was found to depend significantly on the any alcohol concentration suggesting that it gives a profound contribution to the rise of the measured quantum yield with alcohol concentration. This conclusion supports the established mechanism of the fluorescence quenching in FAD through electron transfer reaction in the $\\pi$-stacked conformation between isoalloxazine and adenine moieties.

    "abstract": "High-energy spin-polarized electron, positron, and $\\gamma$-photon beams have many significant applications in the study of material properties, nuclear structure, particle physics, and high-energy astrophysics. Thus, efficient production of such polarized beams attracts a broad spectrum of research interests. This is driven mainly by the rapid advancements in ultrashort and ultraintense laser technology. Currently available laser pulses can achieve peak intensities in the range of $10^{22}-10^{23}$ Wcm$^{-2}$, with pulse durations of tens of femtoseconds. The dynamics of particles in laser fields of the available intensities is dominated by quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the interaction mechanisms have reached regimes spanned by nonlinear multiphoton absorbtion (strong-field QED processes). In strong-field QED processes, the scattering cross sections obviously depend on the spin and polarization of the particles, and the spin-dependent photon emission and the radiation-reaction effects can be utilized to produce the polarized particles. An ultraintense laser-driven polarized particle source possesses the advantages of high-brilliance and compactness, which could open the way for the unexplored aspects in a range of researches. In this work, we briefly review the seminal conclusions from the study of the polarization effects in strong-field QED processes, as well as the progress made by recent proposals for production of the polarized particles by laser-beam or laser-plasma interactions.

One of the most important wave mode for such scattering is the electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) mode. Within the quasi-linear diffusion framework, the cyclotron resonance of relativistic electrons with EMIC waves results in very fast electron precipitation to the atmosphere. However, wave intensities often exceed the threshold for nonlinear resonant interaction, and such intense EMIC waves have been shown to transport electrons away from the loss cone due to the force bunching effect. In this study we investigate if this transport can block electron precipitation. We combine test particle simulations, low-altitude ELFIN observations of EMIC-driven electron precipitation, and ground-based EMIC observations. Comparing simulations and observations, we show that, despite of the low pitch-angle electrons being transported away from the loss cone, the scattering at higher pitch angles results in the loss cone filling and electron precipitation.

Moreover, by introducing the radiative resistance to the circuit theory, the dipole moment, extinction spectrum, and the near-field enhancement of nanorod have been derived analytically and confirmed numerically.

The lower and upper vibrational polaritons are of mixed light-matter hybrid character, whereas the intermediate state is purely photonic in nature. The VPCIs provide effective population transfer channels between singly-excited vibrational polaritons, which manifest in rich interference patterns in rotational densities. Spectroscopically, three bright singly-excited states are identified, when an external infrared laser field couples to both a molecular and a cavity mode. The non-trivial VPCI topology manifests as pronounced multi-peak progression in the spectral region of the upper vibrational polariton, which is traced back to the emergence of rovibro-polaritonic light-matter hybrid states. Experimentally ubiquitous spontaneous emission from cavity modes induces a dissipative reduction of intensity and peak broadening, which mainly influences the purely photonic intermediate state peak as well as the rovibro-polaritonic progression.

All function is directly attributed to single molecules. We show that this leaves out many important thermodynamic couplings between different variables. A more recent alternative picture for the nerve pulse is of thermodynamic nature. It considers the nerve pulse as a soliton, i.e., a macroscopic excited region with properties that are influenced by thermodynamic variables including voltage, temperature, pressure and chemical potentials of membrane components. All thermodynamic variables are strictly coupled. We discuss the consequences for medical treatment in a view where one can compensate a maladjustment of one variable by adjusting another variable. For instance, one can explain why anesthesia can be counteracted by hydrostatic pressure and decrease in pH, suggest reasons why lithium over-dose may lead to tremor, and how tremor is related to alcohol intoxication. Lithium action as well as the effect of ethanol and the anesthetic ketamine in bipolar patients may fall in similar thermodynamic patterns. Such couplings remain obscure in a purely molecular picture.

    "title": "Physics-guided Terahertz Computational Imaging",
    "abstract": "Visualizing information inside objects is an ever-lasting need to bridge the world from physics, chemistry, biology to computation. Among all tomographic techniques, terahertz (THz) computational imaging has demonstrated its unique sensing features to digitalize multi-dimensional object information in a non-destructive, non-ionizing, and non-invasive way. Applying modern signal processing and physics-guided modalities, THz computational imaging systems are now launched in various application fields in industrial inspection, security screening, chemical inspection and non-destructive evaluation. In this article, we overview recent advances in THz computational imaging modalities in the aspects of system configuration, wave propagation and interaction models, physics-guided algorithm for digitalizing interior information of imaged objects. Several image restoration and reconstruction issues based on multi-dimensional THz signals are further discussed, which provides a crosslink between material digitalization, functional property extraction, and multi-dimensional imager utilization from a signal processing perspective.

    "title": "Scaling theory of wave confinement in classical and quantum periodic  systems",
    "abstract": "Functional defects in periodic media confine waves - acoustic, electromagnetic, electronic, spin, etc. - in various dimensions, depending on the structure of the defect. While defects are usually modelled by a superlattice with a typical band-structure representation of energy levels, determining the confinement associated with a given band is highly non-trivial and no analytical method is known to date. Therefore, we propose a rigorous method to classify the dimensionality of the confinement. Starting from the confinement energy and the mode volume, we use finite-size scaling to find that ratios of these quantities to certain powers yield the confinement dimensionality of each band. This classification has negligible additional computational costs compared to a band structure calculation and is valid for any type of wave in both quantum and classical regimes, and any dimension. In the quantum case, we illustrate our method on electronic confinement in 2D hexagonal BN with a nitrogen vacancy, which confirms the previous results. In the classical case, we study a three-dimensional photonic band gap cavity superlattice, where we identify novel acceptor-like behavior. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the in-plane optical phonon modes of current-carrying single-layer graphene whose coupling to the $\\pi$ electron gas is strong. Such modes are expected to undergo a frequency shift compared to the non-current-carrying state due to the non-equilibrium occupation of the Dirac cone electronic eigen-states with the flowing $\\pi$ electron gas. Large electron-phonon coupling (EPC) can be identified by an abrupt change in the slope of the phonon mode dispersion known as the Kohn anomaly, which mainly occurs for (i) the in-plane longitudinal/transverse optical (LO/TO) modes at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center ($\\Gamma$ point), and (ii) the TO modes at the BZ corners ($K$ points). We show that the breaking of the rotational symmetry by the DC current results in different frequency shifts to the $\\Gamma$-TO and $\\Gamma$-LO modes. More specifically, the DC current breaks the TO-LO mode degeneracy at the $\\Gamma$ point which ideally would be manifested as the splitting of the Raman G peak. ",

    "abstract": "In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inhomogeneity in the main magnetic field used for imaging, referred to as off-resonance, can lead to image artifacts ranging from mild to severe depending on the application. Off-resonance artifacts, such as signal loss, geometric distortions, and blurring, can compromise the clinical and scientific utility of MR images. In this review, we describe sources of off-resonance in MRI, how off-resonance affects images, and strategies to prevent and correct for off-resonance. Given recent advances and the great potential of low field and/or portable MRI, we also highlight the advantages and challenges of imaging at low field with respect to off-resonance. ",
