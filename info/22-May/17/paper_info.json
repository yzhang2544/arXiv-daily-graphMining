    "abstract": "Optical spectroscopic sensors are powerful tools for analysing gas mixtures in industrial and scientific applications. Whilst highly sensitive spectrometers tend to have a large footprint, miniaturized optical devices usually lack sensitivity or wideband spectroscopic coverage. By employing a widely tunable, passively stable fiber Fabry-Perot cavity (FFPC), we demonstrate an absorption spectroscopic device that continuously samples over several tens of terahertz. Both broadband scans using cavity mode width spectroscopy to identify the spectral fingerprints of analytes and a fast, low-noise scan method for single absorption features to determine concentrations are exemplary demonstrated for the oxygen A-band. The novel scan method uses an injected modulation signal in a Pound-Drever-Hall feedback loop together with a lock-in measurement to reject noise at other frequencies. The FFPC-based approach provides a directly fiber coupled, extremely miniaturized, light-weight and robust platform for analyzing small analyte volumes that can straightforwardly be extended to sensing at different wavelength ranges, liquid analytes and other spectroscopic techniques with only little adjustments of the device platform.

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate enhanced spectral broadening of femtosecond optical pulses af-ter propagation through silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowire waveguides integrated with two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) films. Owing to the strong mode overlap between the SOI nanowires and the GO films with a high Kerr nonlinearity, the self-phase modulation (SPM) process in the hybrid waveguides is significantly enhanced, resulting in greatly improved spectral broadening of the femtosecond optical pulses. A solution-based, transfer-free coating method is used to integrate GO films onto the SOI nanowires with precise control of the film thickness. Detailed SPM measurements using femtosecond optical pulses are carried out, achieving a broadening factor of up to ~4.3 for a device with 0.4-mm-long, 2 layers of GO. By fit-ting the experimental results with theory, we obtain an improvement in the waveguide nonlin-ear parameter by a factor of ~3.5 and the effective nonlinear figure of merit (FOM) by a factor of ~3.8, relative to the uncoated waveguide. Finally, we discuss the influence of GO film length on the spectral broadening and compare the nonlinear optical performance of different integrated waveguides coated with GO films. These results confirm the improved nonlinear optical per-formance for silicon devices integrated with 2D GO films. ",

Here, we have designed and fabricated a monolithic quantum cascade ring laser coupled to an active waveguide that allows for robust, deterministic and controllable unidirectional operation. Spontaneous emission injection through the active waveguide enables dynamical switching between the clockwise and counterclockwise states of the ring laser with as little as 1.6% modulation of the electrical input. We show that this behavior stems from a perturbation in the bistable dynamics of the ring laser. In addition to switching and bistability, our novel coupler design for quantum cascade ring lasers offers an efficient mechanism for outcoupling and light detection. ",

We determine the ionization time separation between interfering pairs of electron orbits by performing a differential Fourier analysis on the measured momentum spectrum. We identify electron holograms formed by trajectory pairs whose ionization times are separated by less than a single quarter cycle, between a quarter cycle and half cycle, between a half cycle and three fourths of a cycle, and a full cycle apart. We compare our experimental results to the predictions of the Coulomb quantum orbit strong-field approximation (CQSFA), with significant success. We also time-filter the CQSFA trajectory calculations to demonstrate the validity of the technique on spectra with known time correlations. As a general analysis technique, the filter can be applied to all energy- and angularly-resolved datasets to recover time correlations between interfering electron pathways, providing an important tool to analyze any strong-field ionization spectra.

However, current chiral nanophotonic based strategies are intrinsically limited because they rely on far-field optical measurements that are sensitive to a much larger near-field volume, than that influenced by the chiral molecules. Consequently, they depend on detecting small changes in far-field optical response restricting detection sensitivities. Here we exploit an intriguing phenomenon, plasmonic circularly polarised luminescence (PCPL), which is an incisive local probe of near-field chirality. This allows chiral detection of monolayer quantities of a de novo designed peptide, which is not achieved with a far-field response. Our work demonstrates that by leveraging the capabilities of nanophotonic platforms with the near-field sensitivity of PCPL, optimal biomolecular detection performance can be achieved, opening new avenues for nanometrology.

    "abstract": "Non-perturbative and phase-sensitive light-matter interactions have led to the generation of attosecond pulses of light and the control electrical currents on the same timescale. Traditionally, probing these effects via high harmonic generation has involved complicated lasers and apparatuses to generate the few-cycle and high peak power pulses needed to obtain and measure spectra that are sensitive to the phase of the light wave. Instead, we show that nonlinear effects dependent on the carrier-envelope phase can be accessed in solid state crystals with simple low-energy frequency combs that we combine with high-sensitivity demodulation techniques to measure harmonic spectral modulations. Central to this advance is the use of a scalable 100 MHz Erbium-fiber frequency comb at 1550 nm to produce 10 nJ, 20 fs pulses which are focused to the TW/cm2 level. In a single pass through a 500 {\\mu}m ZnO crystal this yields harmonic spectra as short as 200 nm. With this system, we introduce a technique of carrier-envelope amplitude modulation spectroscopy (CAMS) and use it to characterize the phase-sensitive modulation of the ultraviolet harmonics with 85 dB signal-to-noise ratio. We further verify the non-perturbative nature of the harmonic generation through polarization gating of the driving pulse to increase the effects of the carrier-envelope phase. Our work demonstrates robust and ultra-sensitive methods for generating and characterizing harmonic generation at 100 MHz rates that should provide advantages in the study of attosecond nonlinear processes in solid state systems. Additionally, as a simple and low-noise frequency comb, this broadband source will be useful for precision dual-comb spectroscopy of a range of physical systems across the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions (200 - 650 nm).

Here, we demonstrate quantum interference driven by multiple photons in the emission spectroscopy of nitrogen ions that are resonantly pumped by ultrafast infrared laser pulses. In the spectral domain, Fano resonance is observed in the emission spectrum, where a laser-assisted dynamic Stark effect creates the continuum. In the time domain, the fast-evolving emission is measured, revealing the nature of free-induction decay (FID) arising from quantum radiation and molecular cooperativity. These findings clarify the mechanism of coherent emission of nitrogen ions pumped with MIR pump laser and are likely to be universal. The present work opens a route to explore the important role of quantum interference during the interaction of intense laser pulses with materials near multiple photon resonance. ",

This treatment often violates symmetry, thereby deteriorating the convergence of fidelity to the exact solution, and ultimately resulting in deeper circuits. We demonstrate that symmetry-projection can provide a simple yet effective solution to this problem, by keeping the quantum state in the correct symmetry space, to reduce the overall gate operations.

This approach requires extra unitary transformations to rotate the state of interest so that the measurement of a fragment's Ising form would be equivalent to measurement of the fragment for the unrotated state. These extra rotations allow one to perform a fewer number of measurements by grouping more terms into the measurable fragments with a lower overall estimator variance. However, previous estimations of the number of measurements did not take into account non-unit fidelity of quantum gates implementing the additional transformations. Through a circuit fidelity reduction, additional transformations introduce extra uncertainty and increase the needed number of measurements. Here we consider a simple model for errors introduced by additional gates needed in schemes involving grouping of commuting Pauli products. For a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians, we confirm that the numbers of measurements in schemes using non-local qubit rotations are still lower than those in their local qubit rotation counterparts, even after accounting for uncertainties introduced by additional gates.

We provide a detailed scheme to utilize excitations of such cooperative modes consisting of arrays of electromagnetic multipoles to form an atomic Huygens' surface, with complete $2\\pi$ phase control of transmitted light and almost no reflection, allowing nearly arbitrary wavefront shaping. In the numerical examples, this is achieved by controlling the atomic level shifts of Sr with off-resonant ${^3P}_J\\rightarrow {^3D}_1$ transitions, which results in a simultaneous excitation of arrays of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles or magnetic dipoles.

    "title": "Quantum Receiver Enhanced by Adaptive Learning",
    "abstract": "Quantum receivers aim to effectively navigate the vast quantum-state space to endow quantum information processing capabilities unmatched by classical receivers. To date, only a handful of quantum receivers have been constructed to tackle the problem of discriminating coherent states. Quantum receivers designed by analytical approaches, however, are incapable of effectively adapting to diverse environment conditions, resulting in their quickly diminishing performance as the operational complexities increase. Here, we present a general architecture, dubbed the quantum receiver enhanced by adaptive learning (QREAL), to adapt quantum receiver structures to diverse operational conditions. QREAL is experimentally implemented in a hardware platform with record-high efficiency. Combining the QREAL architecture and the experimental advances, the error rate is reduced up to 40% over the standard quantum limit in two coherent-state encoding schemes. ",
