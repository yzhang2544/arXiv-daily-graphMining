    "abstract": "The classic self-referenced frequency comb acts as an unrivaled ruler for precision optical metrology in both time and frequency. Two decades after its invention, the frequency comb is now used in numerous active sensing applications. Many of these applications, however, are limited by the tradeoffs inherent in the rigidity of the comb output and operate far from quantum-limited sensitivity. Here we demonstrate an agile programmable frequency comb where the pulse time and phase are digitally controlled with +/- 2 attosecond accuracy. This agility enables quantum-limited sensitivity in sensing applications since the programmable comb can be configured to coherently track weak returning pulse trains at the shot-noise limit. To highlight its capabilities, we use this programmable comb in a ranging system, reducing the detection threshold by ~5,000-fold to enable nearly quantum-limited ranging at mean pulse photon number of 1/77 while retaining the full accuracy and precision of a rigid frequency comb. Beyond ranging and imaging, applications in time/frequency metrology, comb-based spectroscopy, pump-probe experiments, and compressive sensing should benefit from coherent control of the comb-pulse time and phase.

    "abstract": "An electro-optic dual comb system based on chirped-pulse waveforms is used to simultaneously acquire temporally magnified rapid passage signals and normal spectral line shapes from the back-transformation to the time domain. Multi-heterodyne THz wave generation and detection is performed with the difference frequency mixing of two free-running lasers. The method is used to obtain THz spectra of formic acid in the 10 cm-1 to 20 cm-1 (300 GHz to 600 GHz) region over a range of pressures. The method is widely applicable across other spectral regions for investigations of the transient dynamics and spectroscopy of molecular systems. ",

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) coupled to quantum dots (QDs), trapped atoms and ions, and point defects have been proposed as quantum transduction platforms, yet the requisite coupling rates and cavity lifetimes have not been experimentally established. Although the interaction mechanism varies, small acoustic cavities with large zero-point motion are required for high efficiencies. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through electro- and opto-mechanical characterization of tightly focusing, single-mode Gaussian SAW cavities at ~3.6 GHz on GaAs in the quantum regime, with mode volumes approaching 6{\\lambda}^3. Employing strain-coupled single InAs QDs as optomechanical intermediaries, we measure single-phonon optomechanical coupling rates g_0 > 2{\\pi} x 1 MHz, implying zero-point displacements >1 fm. In semi-planar cavities, we obtain quality factors >18,000 and finesse >140. To demonstrate operation at mK temperatures required for quantum transduction, we use a fiber-based confocal microscope in a dilution refrigerator to perform single-QD resonance fluorescence sideband spectroscopy showing conversion of microwave phonons to optical photons with sub-natural linewidths. These devices approach or meet the limits required for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. ",

    "abstract": "High precision spectroscopy of the low-lying dielectronic resonances in fluorine-like nickel ions were determined by employing the merged electron-ion beam at the heavy-ion storage ring CSRm. The measured dielectronic resonances are identified by comparing with the most recent relativistic calculation utilizing the FAC code. The first resonance at about 86 meV due to the dielectronic recombination via (2s2p6[2S1/2]6s)J=1 intermediate state was recognized. The experimental determination of the resonance position at 86 meV reaches an uncertainty of 4 meV, which allows precise determination of the 2s22p5[2P3/2] - 2s2p6[2S1/2] transition energy. The Rydberg binding energy of the 6s electron in the (2s2p6[2S1/2]6s)J=1 state is calculated by the multi-configurational Dirac-HartreeFock and stabilization methods. The determined transition energies are 149.056(4)exp(10)theo and 149.032(4)exp(6)theo, respectively. Moreover, the transition energy has also been calculated by fully relativistic and ab initio approaches. Individual theoretical contributions are evaluated by employing the core-Hartree and Kohn-Sham screening potentials, respectively. High-order QED and correlation effects contribute prominently to the total transition energy. The present DR precision spectroscopy study at the CSRm paves the way for future precision measurements of atomic energy levels with heavier highly charged ions. ",

    "abstract": "Phase transitions and the associated symmetry breaking are at the heart of many physical phenomena. Coupled systems with multiple interacting degrees of freedom provide a fertile ground for emergent dynamics that is otherwise inaccessible in their solitary counterparts. Here we show that coupled nonlinear optical resonators can undergo self-organization in their spectrum leading to a first-order phase transition. We experimentally demonstrate such a spectral phase transition in time-multiplexed coupled optical parametric oscillators. We switch the nature of mutual coupling from dispersive to dissipative and access distinct spectral regimes of the parametric oscillator dimer. We observe abrupt spectral discontinuity at the first-order transition point which can pave the way for the realization of novel transition-edge sensors. Furthermore, we show how non-equilibrium phase transitions can lead to enhanced sensing, where the applied perturbation is not resolvable by the underlying linear system. Our results can pave the way for sensing using nonlinear driven-dissipative systems leading to performance enhancements without sacrificing sensitivity. ",

With the insertion of the grating as a tunable spectrum filter, the laser operates at a stable dissipative soliton state with a 3.84 ps duration. Replacing the grating with a mirror, NLPs with double-scale intensity autocorrelation trace is ultimately attained. Numerical simulations are performed in detail and demonstrated that with the absence of a spectrum filter, the stable state cannot be established but form the random pulse cluster. The random pulse cluster achieves dynamic stability with suitable feedback, and the NLP is ultimately generated. The NLP here is directly evolved by the initial noise, and no other states occur during its evolution. These explorations could deepen the understanding of NLP and enrich the complex dynamics of the ANDi ultrafast fiber laser. ",

To localize the nanowire, we employ a deep learning analysis of the scattering of topologically structured light, which is highly sensitive to the nanowire's position.

    "abstract": "Macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as observed in superfluids and superconductors, have led to promising technological advancements and some of the most important tests of fundamental physics. At present, quantum detection of light is mostly relegated to the microscale, where avalanche photodiodes are very sensitive to distinguishing single-photon events from vacuum but cannot differentiate between larger photon-number events. Beyond this, the ability to perform measurements to resolve photon numbers is highly desirable for a variety of quantum information applications including computation, sensing, and cryptography. True photon-number resolving detectors do exist, but they are currently limited to the ability to resolve on the order of 10 photons, which is too small for certain proposals. In this work, we extend photon measurement into the mesoscopic regime by implementing a detection scheme based on multiplexing highly quantum-efficient transition-edge sensors to accurately resolve photon numbers between zero and 100. We then demonstrate the use of our system by implementing a quantum random number generator with no inherent bias. This method is based on sampling a coherent state in the photon-number basis and is robust against environmental noise, phase and amplitude fluctuations in the laser, loss and detector inefficiency as well as eavesdropping. Beyond true random number generation, our detection scheme serves as a means to implement quantum measurement and engineering techniques valuable for photonic quantum information processing. ",

The axion haloscope using a resonant cavity has provided the most sensitive search method in the microwave region. However, experimental searches have been limited to relatively low mass regions mainly due to the reduced cavity volume at high masses. As an effective approach for high-mass axion searches, a unique cavity design featuring multiple identical cells divided by equidistant thin metal partitions in a single cylindrical cavity was proposed and successfully demonstrated. This report reviews the characteristics of the multiple-cell cavity design and discusses the various advantages it offers for high-mass axion searches. ",

    "abstract": "Computing a matrix permanent is known to be a classically intractable problem. This paper presents the first polynomial time quantum algorithm for computing permanents of arbitrary $N$-dimensional square matrices with multiplicative error and additive error protocols. We transformed the well-known classical algorithm, Ryser's formula, into sums of quantum overlap integrals to develop the quantum algorithm. This requires $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(N^{3})$ evaluations of the real part of the quantum overlap integrals for real and complex matrices, respectively, with polynomial depth quantum circuits of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits. The existence of the polynomial time multiplicative error estimation of a matrix permanent would strongly imply that quantum computers can access the #P-hard problem. Our quantum algorithm attains the milestone of opening a new direction in quantum computing and computational complexity theory. It could resolve crucial computational complexity issues like locating the bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) relative to the polynomial hierarchy, which has been a big complexity question. Depending on the size of a matrix norm of interest, we can also obtain an exponentially small additive error estimation and better estimation against Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The additive error protocol is practically implementable in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Moreover, our quantum algorithm directly shows the computational complexity connection between the matrix permanent and the real-time partition function of the quantum Ising Hamiltonian. ",

We inject into the fiber a combination of three coherent continuous waves, which we call Fourier modes, and a random noise. We enhance the noise-driven modulation instability process against the coherent one by boosting the input noise power level to speed up the evolution to the thermalization. The distributions of the Fourier modes power along the fiber length are recorded thanks to a multi-heterodyne time-domain reflectometer. At low input noise levels, we observe up to four recurrences. Whereas, at higher noise levels, the Fourier modes fade into the noise-driven modulation instability spectrum revealing that the process reached an irreversible thermalized state. ",

Here, we design and demonstrate a three-dimensional photonic crystal that realizes a higher-order Dirac semimetal phase. Numerical results on the band structure show that the designed three-dimensional photonic crystal is able to host two four-fold Dirac points, the momentum-space projections of which at an edge are connected by higher-order hinge states. The higher-order topology can be characterised with the calculation of the \\chi(6) topological invariant at different values of k_z. An experiment at microwave frequencies is also presented to measure the hinge state dispersion.

Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) light will then protect most states while detection light is scattered from atoms in the auxiliary state, which is made immune to the EIT protection by angular momentum selection rules and carefully chosen light polarization.
