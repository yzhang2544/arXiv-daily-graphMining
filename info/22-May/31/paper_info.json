    "abstract": "We demonstrate a hermetically sealed packaging system for integrated photonic devices at cryogenic temperatures with plug-and-play functionality. This approach provides the ability to encapsulate a controlled amount of gas into the optical package allowing helium to be used as a heat-exchange gas to thermalize photonic devices, or condensed into a superfluid covering the device. This packaging system was tested using a silicon-on-insulator slot waveguide resonator which fills with superfluid $^4$He below the transition temperature. To optimize the fiber-to-chip optical integration 690 tests were performed by thermally cycling optical fibers bonded to various common photonic chip substrates (silicon, silicon oxide and HSQ) with a range of glues (NOA 61, NOA 68, NOA 88, NOA 86H and superglue). This showed that NOA 86H (a UV curing optical adhesive with a latent heat catalyst) provided the best performance under cryogenic conditions for all the substrates tested. The technique is relevant to superfluid optomechanics experiments, as well as quantum photonics and quantum optomechanics applications. ",

    "abstract": "The advent of optical frequency standards with ultimate uncertainties in the low 1x10$^{-18}$ requires femtosecond frequency combs to support a similar level of resolution in the spectral transfer and the computation of optical frequency ratios. The related experimental challenges grow together with the number of optical frequencies to be measured simultaneously, as in many cases the comb's optical power does not allow reliable beatnote counting or tracking in all the spectral regions of interest. Here we describe the use of a track-and-hold amplifier to implement the gated detection, a previously proposed technique for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the beatnote between a low-power tooth of the frequency comb and a continuous wave laser. We demonstrate a 12dB improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of beatnotes involving a broadband-spanning optical comb as compared to traditional detection schemes. Our approach enables reliable and cycle-slip-free spectral purity transfer and reduces the system sensitivity to power drops in the comb spectrum. Being based on a single chip, it is robust, versatile and easily embedded in more complex experimental schemes.

Thereby, we are able to excite and probe a sample, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, with RF and optical signals simultaneously and specifically measure the fluorescence of the sample fully through the fiber. At our targeted frequency-range around 2.9 GHz the facet of the fiber-core is in the near-field of the RF-guiding silver-structure, which comes with the advantage of an optimal RF-intensity decreasing rapidly with the distance. By creating a silver structure on the cladding of the optical fiber we achieve the minimal possible distance between an optically excited and detected sample and an antenna structure without affecting the optical performance of the fiber. This allows us realizing a high RF-amplitude at the sample's position when considering an endoscope solution with integrated optical and RF access. The capabilities of the endoscope are quantified by optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements of a NV-doped microdiamond that we probe as a practical use case. We demonstrate a magnetic sensitivity of our device of 17.8 nT/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ per when measuring the ODMR exclusively through our fiber and compare the sensitivity to a measurement using a confocal microscope. Moreover, such an endoscope could be used as a powerful tool for measuring a variety of fluorescent particles that can otherwise only be measured with bulky and large optical setups. Furthermore, our endoscope points toward precise distance measurements based on Rabi oscillations. ",

In this study, a computational method alongside the experiment is provided for the optical mode decomposition into cavity eigenmodes with justified approximations.

To this end, we demonstrate wave steering, wave focusing, and self-bending propagation. Our results show that the proposed nonlinear metasurface provides an effective and efficient platform to achieve significant SHG, and separate different harmonic components for wavefront control of individual harmonics.

    "abstract": "This paper presents our investigation into the modification of a finite-width internal gravity wave beam arising from triadic resonance instability. We present both experimental and weakly non-linear modelling to examine this instability mechanism, in which a primary wave beam generates two secondary wave beams of lower frequencies and shorter length scales. Through a versatile experimental set-up, we examine how this instability develops over hundreds of buoyancy periods. Unlike predictions from previous zero-dimensional weakly non-linear theory, we find that the approach to a saturated equilibrium state for the triadic interactions is not monotonic; rather, the amplitudes and structures of the constituent beams continue to modulate without ever reaching a steady equilibrium. To understand this behaviour we develop a weakly non-linear approach to account for the spatio-temporal evolution of the amplitudes and structures of the beams over slow time-scales and long distances, and explore the consequences using a numerical scheme. Through this approach, we establish that the evolution of the instability is remarkably sensitive to the spatio-temporal triadic configuration for the system and how part of the observed modulations can be attributed to a competition between the linear growth rate of the secondary wave beams and the finite residence time of the triadic perturbations within the underlying primary beam.

Current realizations of photonic cavities with topological boundaries are often limited by outcoupling issues or poor directionality and require complex design and fabrication that hinder operation at small wavelengths. Here we propose a topological cavity design based on interface states between two one-dimensional photonic crystals with distinct Zak phases and demonstrate a lithography-free, single-mode perovskite laser emitting in the green. Few monolayers of solution processed all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite quantum dots are used as ultrathin gain medium. The topological laser has planar design with large output aperture, akin to vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and is robust against variations of the thickness of the gain medium, from deeply subwavelength to thick quantum dot films. This experimental observation also unveils the topological nature of VCSELs, that is usually overlooked in the description of conventional Fabry-Perot cavity lasers. The design simplicity and topological characteristics make this perovskite quantum dot laser architecture suitable for low-cost and fabrication tolerant vertical emitting lasers operating across the visible spectral region.

    "abstract": "Although quantum computation (QC) is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building and manipulating more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required qubits is necessary to make QC practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot provide useful predictions. We propose to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets, we calculate vibrational frequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation. Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available in near-term quantum computers.

Conventional schemes based on e.g. phase retrieval are troubled with low speed, complicated system, poor robustness, etc. Here, we devise an intelligent processor composed of photonic and electronic neurons for measuring the OAM spectrum in an accurate, fast and direct manner. Specifically, cascaded optical layers extract invisible topological charge (TC) information from incoming light and a shallow electronic layer predicts the exact OAM spectrum. Compared with existing alternatives, the integration of optical-computing in the system promises us a compact single-shot measurement scheme with high detection speed and energy efficiency (optical operations / electronic operations ~10^3), neither necessitating reference wave nor repetitive steps. Results show our processor is endowed with salient generalization ability and robustness against diverse structured light and adverse effects. Besides, it exhibits exceptional performance (mean squared error ~10^(-5)) on unseen experimental data though trained on a fully simulated dataset, which sharply eases the workload on collecting massive labelled experimental training set. We further raise a model interpretation paradigm to reveal the underlying physical mechanisms in hybrid deep learning system, in distinct to conventional black-box neural networks.

The proposed scheme relies on the well-established fact that the Wigner function at a given point $(x,p)$ in phase space is proportional to the expectation value of the parity operator relative to that point. In this work, we show that parity-even and parity-odd motional states can be mapped to two distinct internal states of the atom by using state-dependent trapping potentials. The Wigner function can thus be measured point-by-point in phase space with a single, direct measurement of the internal state population. Numerical simulations show that the scheme is robust in that it applies not only to deep, harmonic potentials but also to shallower, anharmonic traps. ",

    "title": "Measurement and control of a superconducting quantum processor with a  fully-integrated radio-frequency system on a chip",
    "abstract": "We describe a digital microwave platform called Presto, designed for measurement and control of multiple quantum bits (qubits) and based on the third-generation radio-frequency system on a chip. Presto uses direct digital synthesis to create signals up to 9 GHz on 16 synchronous output ports, while synchronously analyzing response on 16 input ports. Presto has 16 DC-bias outputs, 4 inputs and 4 outputs for digital triggers or markers, and two continuous-wave outputs for synthesizing frequencies up to 15 GHz. Scaling to a large number of qubits is enabled through deterministic synchronization of multiple Presto units. A Python application programming interface configures a firmware for synthesis and analysis of pulses, coordinated by an event sequencer. The analysis integrates template matching (matched filtering) and low-latency (184 - 254 ns) feedback to enable a wide range of multi-qubit experiments. We demonstrate Presto's capabilities with experiments on a sample consisting of two superconducting qubits connected via a flux-tunable coupler. We show single-shot readout and active reset of a single qubit; randomized benchmarking of single-qubit gates showing 99.972% fidelity, limited by the coherence time of the qubit; and calibration of a two-qubit iSWAP gate.
