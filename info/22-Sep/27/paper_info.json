    "abstract": "In most cases the ultrafast dynamics of resonantly excited molecules are considered, and almost always computed in the molecular frame, while experiments are carried out in the laboratory frame. Here we provide a formalism in terms of a lab frame density matrix which connects quantum dynamics in the molecular frame to those in the laboratory frame, providing a transparent link between computation and measurement. The formalism reveals that in any such experiment, the molecular frame dynamics vary for molecules in different orientations and that certain coherences which are potentially experimentally accessible are rejected by the orientation-averaged reduced vibronic density matrix. Instead, Molecular Angular Distribution Moments (MADMs) are introduced as a more accurate representation of experimentally accessible information. Furthermore, the formalism provides a clear definition of a molecular frame quantum tomography, and specifies the requirements to perform such a measurement enabling the experimental imaging of molecular frame vibronic dynamics. Successful completion of such a measurement fully characterizes the molecular frame quantum dynamics for a molecule at any orientation in the laboratory frame. ",

    "abstract": "A mid-infrared laser-based sensor is designed and demonstrated for trace detection of benzene, acetylene, and carbon dioxide at ambient conditions. The sensor is based on a distributed feedback quantum cascade lase and a multidimensional liner (DFB-QCL) emitting near 14.84 um. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a multidimensional linear regression algorithm are employed to enable interference-free measurements of the target species. The laser wavelength was tuned over 673.8-675.1 cm-1 by a sine-wave injection current (1 kHz scan rate). Minimum detection limits of 0.11, 4.16, and 2.96 ppm were achieved for benzene, acetylene, and carbon dioxide, respectively. The developed sensor is insensitive to interference from overlapping absorbance spectra, and its performance was demonstrated by measuring known mixture samples prepared in the lab. The sensor can be used to detect tiny leaks of the target species in petrochemical facilities and to monitor air quality in residential and industrial areas. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), which utilize a two-dimensional (2D) optical resonance inside a photonic crystal for lasing, feature various outstanding functionalities such as single-mode high-power operation and arbitrary control of beam polarizations. Although most of the previous designs of PCSELs employ spatially uniform photonic crystals, it is expected that lasing performance can be further improved if it becomes possible to optimize the spatial distribution of photonic crystals. In this paper, we investigate the structural optimization of PCSELs via quantum annealing towards high-power, narrow-beam-divergence operation with linear polarization. The optimization of PCSELs is performed by the iteration of the following three steps: (1) time-dependent 3D coupled-wave analysis of lasing performance, (2) formulation of the lasing performance via a factorization machine, and (3) selection of optimal solution(s) via quantum annealing. By using this approach, we successfully discover an advanced PCSEL with a non-uniform spatial distribution of the band-edge frequency and injection current, which simultaneously enables higher output power, a narrower divergence angle, and a higher linear polarization ratio than conventional uniform PCSELs. Our results potentially indicate the universal applicability of quantum annealing, which has been mainly applied to specific types of discrete optimization problems so far, for various physics and engineering problems in the field of smart manufacturing.

Even when only a static interaction is implemented, through synchronized inputs from connected neurons, the spiking mode of photonic neurons can be spontaneously and adaptively changed between the Class-I and Class-II modes classified by A.

This spontaneous spiking-mode shift induces a significant change in the spiking frequency despite the all neurons having the same natural spiking frequency, which encourages the generation of chimera states.

In the context of broadband mid-infrared spectroscopy, state-of-the-art ultrafast Fourier-transform infrared spectrometers, in particular dual-comb spectrometers, have improved the measurement rate up to a few Mspectra/s, which is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. Time-stretch infrared spectroscopy, an emerging ultrafast frequency-swept mid-infrared spectroscopy technique, has shown a record-high rate of 80 Mspectra/s with an intrinsically higher signal-to-noise ratio than Fourier-transform spectroscopy by more than the square-root of the number of spectral elements. However, it can measure no more than ~30 spectral elements with a low resolution of several cm-1. Here, we significantly increase the measurable number of spectral elements to more than 1,000 by incorporating a nonlinear upconversion process. The one-to-one mapping of a broadband spectrum from the mid-infrared to the near-infrared telecommunication region enables low-loss time-stretching with a single-mode optical fiber and low-noise signal detection with a high-bandwidth photoreceiver. We demonstrate high-resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of gas-phase methane molecules with a high resolution of 0.017 cm-1. This unprecedentedly high-speed vibrational spectroscopy technique would satisfy various unmet needs in experimental molecular science, e.g., measuring ultrafast dynamics of irreversible phenomena, statistically analyzing a large amount of heterogeneous spectral data, or taking broadband hyperspectral images at a high frame rate.

Terahertz imaging is a growing field of research which can provide complementary information to techniques using other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiation, terahertz passes through many everyday materials, such as plastics, cloth and card. Compared with images formed using lower frequencies, terahertz images have superior spatial resolution due to the shorter wavelength, while compared to x-rays and gamma rays, terahertz radiation is non-ionising and safe to use. The tutorial begins with the basic principles of terahertz to optical conversion in alkali atoms before discussing how to construct a model to predict the fluorescent spectra of the atoms, on which the imaging method depends. We discuss the practical aspects of constructing an imaging system, including the subsystem specifications. We then review the typical characteristics of the imaging system including spatial resolution, sensitivity andbandwidth. We conclude with a brief discussion of some potential applications ",

Among numerous candidate kinetic mechanisms, ion-acoustic instabilities driven by the relative drift between ions and electrons, or electric current, have long been hypothesized to play a critical role in dissipating magnetic energy in collisionless plasmas. But their effectiveness and even existence during reconnection remain elusive due to ion Landau damping and difficulties in resolving the Debye length scale in the laboratory. Here we report a sudden onset of ion-acoustic bursts measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of anti-parallel magnetically driven reconnection in high-Z plasmas at low beta in a novel platform using high-power lasers. The ion-acoustic bursts are followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These observations are successfully reproduced by 1D and 2D Particle-in-Cell simulations in which ion-acoustic instabilities, driven by electron jet currents in the reconnection exhaust, grow rapidly to form electrostatic double layers. These double layers induce an electron two-stream instability that generates electron acoustic bursts, during which electrons are heated and accelerated in accordance with the experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate the importance of ion and electron acoustic dynamics during magnetic reconnection when ion Landau damping is ineffective, a condition applicable to a range of astrophysical plasmas including near-Earth space, stellar flares, and black hole accretion engines.

We here present a 64x32 pixel (256x128 SPAD) dToF imager that overcomes these limitations by using pixels with embedded histogramming, which lock onto and track the return signal. This reduces the size of output data frames considerably, enabling maximum frame rates in the 10 kFPS range or 100 kFPS for direct depth readings. The sensor offers selective readout of pixels detecting surfaces, or those sensing motion, leading to reduced power consumption and off-chip processing requirements.

We demonstrate that the determination of $J_c$ is increasingly sensitive with growing disorder of qubits in the combinatorial optimization problems. In addition, the values of appropriate $J_c$, where the values of $p$ are at a maximum, increase with decreasing $\\Delta_s$.

By investigating spin-dependent electron transport using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, the spin polarization in a two-terminal setup is demonstrated to approach unity if the rate of dephasing is sufficiently small and the average chemical potential of the two leads is within an appropriate range of values, which is narrow because of the high frequency of the cavity mode. To obtain a wider range of energies for a large spin polarization, we propose to combine the CISS in chiral molecules with the light-matter interactions.

For instance, the cooperative decay of quantum emitters into a common radiation mode can lead to superradiance, where the emission rate of the ensemble is larger than the sum of the rates of the individual emitters. Here, we report experimental evidence of super spontaneous four-wave mixing (super SFWM), an analogous effect for the generation of photon pairs in a parametric nonlinear process on an integrated photonic device. We study this phenomenon in an array of microring resonators on a silicon photonic chip coupled to bus waveguides. We measured a cooperative pair generation rate that always exceeds the incoherent sum of the rates of the individual resonators. We investigate the physical mechanisms underlying this collective behaviour, clarify the impact of loss, and address the aspects of fundamental and technological relevance of our results. ",
