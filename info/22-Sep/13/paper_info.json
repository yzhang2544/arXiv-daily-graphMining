This interferometer consists of customized prisms and waveplates assembled as a quasi-monolithic unit to realize a miniaturized system. The interferometer design adopts a common-mode rejection scheme to provide a high rejection ratio to common environmental noise. Experimental tests in vacuum show a displacement sensitivity level of 11 pm/rtHz at 100mHz, and as low as 0.6pm/rtHz above 1Hz.

    "abstract": "To achieve the physics goals of future colliders, it is necessary to develop novel, radiation-hard silicon sensors for their tracking detectors. We target the replacement of hybrid pixel detectors with Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (DMAPS) that are radiation-hard, monolithic CMOS sensors. We have designed, manufactured and tested the MALTA series of sensors, which are DMAPS in the 180 nm TowerJazz CMOS imaging technology. MALTA have a pixel pitch well below current hybrid pixel detectors, high time resolution (< 2 ns) and excellent charge collection efficiency across pixel geometries. These sensors have a total silicon thickness of between 50-300 $\\mu$m, implying reduced material budgets and multiple scattering rates for future detectors which utilize such technology. Furthermore, their monolithic design bypasses the costly stage of bump-bonding in hybrid sensors and can substantially reduce detector costs. This contribution presents the latest results from characterization studies of the MALTA2 sensors, including results demonstrating the radiation tolerance of these sensors. ",

However, traditional control of emission from quantum light sources relies on the use of multiple bulky optical elements or nanostructured resonators with limited functionalities, constraining the potential of multi-dimensional tailoring. Here we introduce the use of an ultrathin polarisation-beam-splitting metalens for the arbitrary structuring of quantum emission at room temperature. Owing to the complete and independent polarisation and phase control at a single meta-atom level, the designed metalens enables simultaneous imaging of quantum emission from ultra-bright defects in hexagonal boron nitride and imprinting of an arbitrary wavefront onto orthogonal polarisation states of the sources. The hybrid quantum metalens enables simultaneous manipulation of multiple degrees of freedom of a quantum light source, including directionality, polarisation, and orbital angular momentum. The demonstrated arbitrary wavefront shaping of quantum emission in multiple degrees of freedom could unleash the full potential of solid-state SPEs for their use as high-dimensional quantum sources for advanced quantum photonic applications.

Four scenarios with different combinations of EGAM initial amplitudes and linear EGAM growth rates are designed to delineate the effects of linear EGAM drive and finite EGAM amplitude on DW nonlinear dynamic evolution. In presence of the linear EPs drive, the soliton propagation is enhanced, due to the generation of small radial scale structures. Two conservation laws of the nonlinear system are derived, including the energy conservation law. It is found that the energy of DW always decreases and that of EGAM always increases, leading to regulation of DW by EGAM. ",

    "abstract": "The interaction of magnetic dipole (MD) emitters and common photonic cavities are usually weak, which is partially due to the low magnetic near field enhancements of the cavities. Here, we show that whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of a subwavelength dielectric cavity can not only greatly boost the emission rate of a MD emitter but also bring efficient couplings between coherent MD emitters. In a WGM cavity, the maximal emission rate ({\\gamma}max) of a single emitter occurs at an antinode of the field pattern. The emission of the MD emitter can also be greatly affected by another coherent one depending on the magnetic field response of the WGM. The maximal contribution can also reach {\\gamma}max. Notably, the cooperative emission rate of the coherent MD emitters does not decay with distance in the considered range due to the high-quality feature of a WGM. In contrast to the emission, the absorption of an emitter is hardly affected by the coherent couplings between emitters mediated by a WGM. The difference between the performances of emission and absorption is highly related to the excitation behaviors of WGMs. Our results are important for enhanced magnetic light-matter interactions. ",

Great efforts have been made to continuously expand the number of DOFs, and a maximal number of six has been achieved recently. However, the realization of 'holy grail' goal with eight DOFs (full free parameters) has been proven as a great challenge so far. Here, we show that by cascading two layer metasurfaces and utilizing the gradient descent optimization algorithm, a spatially varying Jones matrix with eight DOFs is constructed and verified numerically and experimentally in optical frequencies. Such ultimate control unlocks new opportunities to design optical functionalities that are unattainable with previously known methodologies and may find wide potential applications in optical fields.

Yet, the charge of the produced beam is tens of pC per Joule of laser energy, still limiting its use for a wider range of applications. The possibility of generating high charge beam while keeping a good beam quality, stays to be explored. Moreover, despite previous studies focused on separate physical processes such as beam loading which affects the uniformity of the acceleration field and thus the energy spread of the trapped electrons, repulsive force from the rear spike of the bubble which reduces the transverse momentum $p_\\perp$ of the trapped electrons and results in small beam emmittance, and the laser evolution when travelling in plasma. A more general investigation of the plasma density parameters on the final beam properties is required. In this work, we demonstrate that the current profile of the injected electron beam is directly correlated with the density transition parameters, which further affects the beam charge and energy spread. By fine-tuning the plasma density parameters, high-charge (up to several hundreds of pC) and low-energy-spread (around 1\\% FWHM) electron beams can be obtained. All these results are supported by large-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. ",

The tiled substrates composed of both active and passive areas allow to pattern the mask of the integrated active passive photonic device at once using a single continuous photolithography process. The interface loss of tiled substrate is measured as low as 0.26 dB. Thanks to the stability provided by this approach, a four-channel waveguide amplifier is realized in a straightforward manner, which shows a net gain of ~5 dB at 1550-nm wavelength and that of ~8 dB at 1530-nm wavelength for each channel. The robust low-loss optical interface for passive/active photonic integration will facilitate large-scale high performance photonic devices which require on-chip light sources and amplifiers. ",

This places requirements on developing colored covers with a trade-off between efficiency and aesthetics, providing a new stage for the large-scale application of structural color technologies. Here in this study, we have investigated the theoretic feasibility of employing the photonic glass, a random packing of monodisperse dielectric microspheres, as the colored cover for solar energy harvesting. Based on numerous optical simulations, we have evaluated the color and average solar transmissivity (AST) of the photonic glasses with varying parameters. Results show that using non-absorbing microspheres with relatively high refractive index, about 3 {\\mu}m thick photonic glasses could enable colors with lightness over 50 while keeping AST at around 80%. Besides, we demonstrate that due to the short-range structural correlation, photonic glasses could generate purple, blue, cyan, light green, and grey colors, but cannot help with yellow and red color hues. Finally, the effects of several enhancement methods are clarified, and possible ways for expanding the color range are demonstrated. These results provide a comprehensive guide to the practical implementations of structural color using photonic glasses, particularly in the colorization of solar energy materials. ",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art CMOS technology has started to adopt three-dimensional (3D) integration approaches, enabling continuous chip density increment and performance improvement, while alleviating difficulties encountered in traditional planar scaling. This new device architecture, in addition to the efforts required for extracting the best material properties, imposes a challenge of reducing the thermal budget of processes to be applied everywhere in CMOS devices, so that conventional processes must be replaced without any compromise to device performance. Ultra-violet laser annealing (UV-LA) is then of prime importance to address such a requirement. First, the strongly limited absorption of UV light into materials allows surface-localized heat source generation. Second, the process timescale typically ranging from nanoseconds (ns) to microseconds ({\\mu}s) efficiently restricts the heat diffusion in the vertical direction. In a given 3D stack, these specific features allow the actual process temperature to be elevated in the top-tier layer without introducing any drawback in the bottom-tier one. In addition, short-timescale UV-LA may have some advantages in materials engineering, enabling the nonequilibrium control of certain phenomenon such as crystallization, dopant activation, and diffusion. This paper reviews recent progress reported about the application of short-timescale UV-LA to different stages of CMOS integration, highlighting its potential of being a key enabler for next generation 3D-integrated CMOS devices.

The renormalization program is an essential part of the calculation of the scattering amplitudes, where the infinities of the calculated masses of the elementary particles are subtracted for the progressive calculation of the higher-order perturbative terms. The mathematical structure of the mass term from quantum field theories expressed in the form of infinities suggests that there exists a finite dynamical mass in the limit when the input mass parameter approaches zero. The Lagrangian recovers symmetry at the same time as the input mass becomes zero, whereas the self-energy diagrams acquire a finite dynamical mass of the quantum fields in the 4-dimensional space when the dimensional regularization method of renormalization is utilized. The complex forms of the QCD and QED interaction potentials are obtained by replacing the fixed mass and coupling constants in the Yukawa potential with the scale-dependent running coupling constant and the corresponding dynamical mass. The derived QCD potential predicts quark confinement and deconfinement, and the QED potential derived by the same method predicts the sharply rising delta function potential near the contact distance between the electron and positron.

Variational quantum algorithms are particularly promising since they are comparatively noise tolerant and aim to achieve a quantum advantage with only a few hundred qubits. Furthermore, they are applicable to a wide range of optimization problems arising throughout the natural sciences and industry. To demonstrate the possibilities for the aeroscience community, we give a perspective on how variational quantum algorithms can be utilized in computational fluid dynamics. We discuss how classical problems are translated into quantum algorithms and their logarithmic scaling with problem size. As an explicit example we apply this method to Burgers' Equation in one spatial dimension. We argue that a quantum advantage over classical computing methods could be achieved by the end of this decade if quantum hardware progresses as currently envisaged and emphasize the importance of joining up development of quantum algorithms with application-specific expertise to achieve real-world impact.

    "abstract": "Excitability, encountered in numerous fields from biology to neurosciences and optics, is a general phenomenon characterized by an all-or-none response of a system to an external perturbation. When subject to delayed feedback, excitable systems can sustain multistable pulsing regimes, which are either regular or irregular time sequences of pulses reappearing every delay time. Here, we investigate an excitable microlaser subject to delayed optical feedback and study the emergence of complex pulsing dynamics, including periodic, quasiperiodic and irregular pulsing regimes. This work is motivated by experimental observations showing these different types of pulsing dynamics. A suitable mathematical model, written as a system of delay differential equations, is investigated through an in-depth bifurcation analysis. We demonstrate that resonance tongues play a key role in the emergence of complex dynamics, including non-equidistant periodic pulsing solutions and chaotic pulsing. The structure of resonance tongues is shown to depend very sensitively on the pump parameter. Successive saddle transitions of bounding saddle-node bifurcations constitute a merging process that results in unexpectedly large locking regions, which subsequently disconnect from the relevant torus bifurcation curve; the existence of such unconnected regions of periodic pulsing is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. As we show, the transition to unconnected resonance regions is due to a general mechanism: the interaction of resonance tongues locally at an extremum of the rotation number on a torus bifurcation curve. We present and illustrate the two generic cases of disconnecting and of disappearing resonance tongues. Moreover, we show how a maximum and a minimum of the rotation number appears naturally when two torus bifurcation curves undergo a saddle transition (where they connect differently). ",

    "title": "Experimentally-realizable $\\mathcal{PT}$ phase transitions in  reflectionless quantum scattering",
    "abstract": "A class of above-barrier quantum-scattering problems is shown to provide an experimentally-accessible platform for studying $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Schr\\\"odinger equations that exhibit spontaneous $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking despite having purely real potentials. These potentials are one-dimensional, inverted, and unstable and have the form $V(x) = - \\lvert x\\rvert^p$ ($p>0$), terminated at a finite length or energy to a constant value as $x\\to \\pm\\infty$. The signature of unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is the existence of reflectionless propagating states at discrete real energies up to arbitrarily high energy. In the $\\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, there are no such solutions. In addition, there exists an intermediate mixed phase, where reflectionless states exist at low energy but disappear at a fixed finite energy, independent of termination length. In the mixed phase exceptional points (EPs) occur at specific $p$ and energy values, with a quartic dip in the reflectivity in contrast to the quadratic behavior away from EPs. $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking phenomena have not been previously predicted in a quantum system with a real potential and no reservoir coupling. The effects predicted here are measurable in standard cold-atom experiments with programmable optical traps. The physical origin of the symmetry-breaking transition is elucidated using a WKB force analysis that identifies the spatial location of the above-barrier scattering. ",
