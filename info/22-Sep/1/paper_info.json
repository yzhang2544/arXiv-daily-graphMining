    "abstract": "Experiments performed using optical trapping assays constitute an important means of accurately measuring the molecular forces generated by molecular motor proteins. We investigate, using theory and stochastic simulations, the transport properties of cargo transported by dynein molecular motors - both singly and in teams - in a harmonic potential, which mimics the variable force experienced by cargo in an optical trap. In particular, we investigate the role of the dynein catch bond in altering the transport properties of cellular cargo - as quantified through the biologically relevant measures of run lengths, detachment forces and first passage time. Our results suggest that even for cargo transported by a single motor, catchbonding may play a role depending on the force scale which marks the onset of the catch bond. For cargo transported by multiple motors, emergent collective effects due to catchbonding can result in non-trivial re-entrant phenomena for average first passage times and detachment forces as function of the stall force and the motor velocity.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate comprehensive numerical studies on a hybrid III-V/Si-based waveguide system, serving as a platform for efficient light coupling between an integrated III-V quantum dot emitter to an on-chip quantum photonic integrated circuit defined on a silicon substrate. We propose a platform consisting of a hybrid InP/Si waveguide and an InP-embedded InAs quantum dot, emitting at the telecom C-band near 1550 nm. The platform can be fabricated using the existing semiconductor processing technologies. Our numerical studies reveal nearly 86% of the optical field transfer efficiency between geometrically-optimized InP/Si and Si waveguides, considering propagating field modes along a tapered geometry. The coupling efficiency of a dipole emitting to the hybrid InP/Si waveguide is evaluated to ~60%, which results in more than 50% of the total on-chip optical field transfer efficiency from the dipole to the Si waveguide. We also consider the off-chip outcoupling efficiency of the propagating photon field along the Si waveguide by examining the normal to the chip plane and in-plain outcoupling configurations. In the former case, the outcoupling amounts to ~26% when using the circular Bragg grating outcoupler design. In the latter case, the efficiency reaches up to 10%. Finally, we conclude that the conceptual device's performance is weakly susceptible to the transferred photon wavelength, offering a broadband operation within the 1.5-1.6 {\\mu}m spectral range. ",

    "abstract": "Acoustic mixing of droplets is a promising way to implement biosensors that combine high speed and minimal reagent consumption. To date, this type of droplet mixing is driven by a volume force resulting from the absorption of high-frequency acoustic waves in the bulk of the fluid. Here, we show that the speed of these sensors is limited by the slow advection of analyte to the sensor surface due to the formation of a hydrodynamic boundary layer. We eliminate this hydrodynamic boundary layer by using much lower ultrasonic frequencies to excite the droplet, which drives a Rayleigh streaming that behaves essentially like a slip velocity. Three-dimensional simulations show that this provides a threefold speedup compared to Eckart streaming. Experimentally, we shorten a SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay from 20 min to 40 s. ",

    "abstract": "Microcavities have long been recognized as indispensable elements in quantum photonic research due to their usefulness for enhanced light extraction and light-matter interaction. A conventional high-Q cavity structure typically allows only a single optical transition to be tuned into resonance with a specific mode. The transition to a more advanced double-cavity structure, however, introduces new and interesting possibilities such as enhancing two spectrally close optical transitions at the same time with two distinct cavity modes. Here, we investigate a cavity structure composed of a monolithic planar cavity enclosed between two semiconductor distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) and a top dielectric mirror deposited on a fiber tip. While the bottom cavity is formed by the two DBRs, the mirror on the fiber tip and the top DBR of the semiconductor chip create a second tunable cavity. These coupled cavities exhibit mode hybridization when tuned into resonance and their splitting can be adjusted to match with the spectral separation of closely spaced optical transitions by a suitable sample design. Furthermore, we report on the simultaneous resonance tuning of the exciton and biexciton transition of a semiconductor quantum dot, each to a separate mode of the open fiber-based double cavity. Decay time measurements at simultaneous resonance showed a Purcell-factor of $F_P^X$=1.9$\\pm$0.4 for the exciton transition. ",

    "abstract": "Light scattering within scattering media presents a substantial obstacle to optical transmission. A speckle pattern with random amplitude and phase distribution is observed when coherent light travels through strong scattering media. Fortunately, wavefront shaping has been successfully employed with a spatial light modulator to recover intensity targets after scattering media, such as a sharp focus point or specified two-dimensional patterns. There have, however, been few studies that attempted to separately manipulate the amplitude and phase of the focusing field. In this paper, we propose a feedback-based wavefront shaping method to generate complex optical fields through scattering medium. A reliable phase retrieval approach is introduced to provide the complex feedback information, i.e., the amplitude and phase of the focusing field. Accordingly, in order to modulate the speckle field into a desired complex structured optical field, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to find the best phase map. To demonstrate the proposed method's high performance, experimental tests have been carried out. High fidelity is demonstrated in the generation of diverse complex light fields, both in amplitude and phase. Our findings may facilitate the manipulation of light field through scattering medium, and are anticipated to further promote future applications such as optogenetics, vortex optical communication, and optical trapping through scattering media.

    "abstract": "To achieve Ampere-class electron beam accelerators the pulse delivery rate need to be much higher than the typical photo injector repetition rate of the order of a few kilohertz. We propose here an injector which can, in principle, generate electron bunches at the same rate as the operating RF frequency. A conduction-cooled superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity operating in the CW mode and housing a field emission element at its region of high axial electric field can be a viable method of generating high-repetition-rate electron bunches. In this paper, we report the development and experiments on a conduction-cooled Nb3Sn cavity with a niobium rod intended as a field emitter support. The initial experiments demonstrate 0.4 MV/m average accelerating gradient, which is equivalent of peak gradient of 3.2 MV/m. The measured RF cavity quality factor is 1.4 x 10$^8$ slightly above our goal. The achieved field gradient is limited by the relatively low input RF power and by the poor coupling between the external power supply and the RF cavity. With ideal coupling the field gradient can be as high as 0.6 MV/m still below our goal of about 1 MV/m. ",

Here we develop a scheme to create an arbitrary SU(2) lattice gauge field for photons in the synthetic frequency dimension using an array of dynamically modulated ring resonators. The photon polarization is taken as the spin basis to implement the matrix-valued gauge fields. Using a non-Abelian generalization of the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian as a specific example, we show that the measurement of the steady-state photon amplitudes inside the resonators can reveal the band structures of the Hamiltonian, which show signatures of the underlying non-Abelian gauge field. These results provide opportunities to explore novel topological phenomena associated with non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in photonic systems. ",

    "abstract": "Measuring the expectation value of the molecular electronic Hamiltonian is one of the challenging parts of the variational quantum eigensolver. A widely used strategy is to express the Hamiltonian as a sum of measurable fragments using fermionic operator algebra. Such fragments have an advantage of conserving molecular symmetries that can be used for error mitigation. The number of measurements required to obtain the Hamiltonian expectation value is proportional to a sum of fragment variances. Here, we introduce a new method for lowering the fragments' variances by exploiting flexibility in the fragments' form. Due to idempotency of the occupation number operators, some parts of two-electron fragments can be turned into one-electron fragments, which then can be partially collected in a purely one-electron fragment. This repartitioning does not affect the expectation value of the Hamiltonian but has non-vanishing contributions to the variance of each fragment. The proposed method finds the optimal repartitioning by employing variances estimated using a classically efficient proxy for the quantum wavefunction. Numerical tests on several molecules show that repartitioning of one-electron terms lowers the number of measurements by more than an order of magnitude. ",

By implementing two different algorithms, a global breadth-first search that searches the entire cluster state and an incremental version that traverses a narrow sub-section of the cluster state, we analyze the tradeoff between the accuracy of finding viable paths and the speed at which this operation can be performed, which constrains the overall photonic clock cycle of the system.
