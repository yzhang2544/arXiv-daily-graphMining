    "title": "Binary Volume Acoustic Holograms",
    "abstract": "In recent years high-resolution 3D printing has enabled a diverse range of new, low-cost, methods for ultrasonic wave-front shaping. Acoustic holograms, particularly, allow for the generation of arbitrary, diffraction limited, acoustic fields at MHz frequencies from single element transducers. These are phase plates that function as direct acoustic analogues to thin optical holograms. In this work it is shown that, by using multiple polymer 3D printing, acoustic analogues to 'thick' or volume optical holograms can also be generated. First, an analytic approach for designing a volume hologram that diffracts a set of input fields onto a desired set of output fields is briefly summarised. Next, a greedy optimisation approach based on random downhill binary search able to account for the constraints imposed by the chosen fabrication method is introduced. Finally, an experimental test-case designed to diffract the field generated by a 2.54 cm, planar, PZT transducer onto 8 distinct patterns dependent on the direction of the incident field is used to validate the approach and the design method. Field scans of the 8 target fields demonstrate that acoustic analogues of optical volume holograms can be generated using multi-polymer printing and that these allow the multiplexing of distinct fields onto different incident field directions.

    "title": "Pouch cells with 15% silicon calendar-aged for 4 years",
    "abstract": "Small amounts of high-capacity silicon-based materials are already used in the anode of commercial Li-ion batteries, helping increase their energy density. Despite their remarkable storage capability, silicon continuously reacts with the electrolyte, accelerating time-dependent cell performance fade. Nevertheless, very limited information is available on the specific consequences of this reactivity for the calendar aging of Li-ion cells. Here, we analyze aging effects on 450 mAh pouch cells containing 15 wt% of Si (and 73 wt% graphite) after storage at 21 oC for four years. We show that severe losses of Si capacity occurred due to particle isolation when cells were stored at high states of charge (SOC), but not when cells were fully discharged prior to storage. Impedance rise was also significantly higher when cells were kept at high SOCs and was mostly due to phenomena taking place at the cathode; the continuous electrolyte reduction at the anode did not lead to a major increase in bulk electrode resistance. A series of post-test characterization provided additional information on the effects of time and SOC on the calendar aging of Si-containing cells. Our study highlights the many challenges posed by Si during calendar aging and can inform future studies in the field. ",

The modes have a continuum spectrum in the infinite system-size limit and can exhibit the non-Hermitian skin effect. In contrast to the conventional non-Hermitian skin modes under the fixed-end open-boundary condition, the modes concerned exhibit a strongly size-dependent spectrum that gradually converges to the non-Bloch-band dispersion. The modes correspond to the poles of the $S$ matrix, and are closely related to the lasing. We demonstrate these properties in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian photonic crystal with gain having a point-(pseudo)gap topology. ",

    "abstract": "Strong electromagnetic pulses (EMP) are generated from intense laser interactions with solid-density targets, and can be guided by the target geometry, specifically through conductive connections to the ground. We present an experimental characterization, by time- and spatial-resolved proton deflectometry, of guided electromagnetic discharge pulses along wires including a coil, driven by 0.5 ps, 50 J, 1e19 W/cm2 laser pulses. Proton-deflectometry data allows to time-resolve first the EMP due to the laser-driven target charging and then the return EMP from the ground through the conductive target stalk. Both EMPs have a typical duration of tens of ps and correspond to currents in the kA-range with electric-field amplitudes of multiple GV/m. The sub-mm coil in the target rod creates lensing effects on probing protons, due to both magnetic- and electric-field contributions. This way, protons of 10 MeV-energy range are focused over cm-scale distances. Experimental results are supported by analytical modelling and high-resolution numerical particle-in-cell simulations, unraveling the likely presence of a surface plasma, which parameters define the discharge pulse dispersion in the non-linear propagation regime.

Quantum time crystals with discretely broken time-translation symmetry have been demonstrated in trapped atomic ions, atoms and spins while continuously broken time-translation symmetry has been observed in an atomic condensate inside an optical cavity. Here we report that a classical nanophotonic structure, a two-dimensional array of plasmonic metamolecules supported on flexible nanowires, can be driven to a state possessing all key features of a continuous time crystal: continuous coherent illumination by light resonant with the metamolecules' plasmonic modes triggers a spontaneous phase transition to a state in which transmissivity oscillations result from a many-body interaction among the metamolecules and which is characterized by long range order in space and time. As the state can be manipulated optically, the phenomenon is of interest to topological and non-Hermitian physics and application in frequency conversion, memory, modulation, nonreciprocity and amplification.

We report on the successful launching of single silica nanoparticles with a minimum radius of 43 nm, which is enabled by the low stiction to the launching surface. Nanoparticles with radii of 43 nm and 71.5 nm are launched with a high flux and small angular spread of $\\sim \\pm 10^\\circ$, which allows for trapping in a tightly focused optical tweezer within a couple of minutes. The measured velocities are significantly smaller than 1 m/s. The demonstrated launching method allows for controlled loading of dry nanoparticles with radii as small as 43 nm into optical traps in (ultra-)high vacuum, although we anticipate that loading of smaller sizes is equally feasible.

However, the flow regime is usually maintained at low Reynolds numbers, to prevent the onset of turbulence features in the flow, that would degrade wavefront quality. We show here how bringing the fluid temperature to the thermo-optical null point, close to the water/ice transition in the case of water, allows one to mitigate the optical consequences of hydrodynamic instabilities, by bleaching optically the temperature inhomogeneities within the flow. This optical process, dubbed 'index-leveling', opens the door to a highly efficient forced-flow, weakly turbulent face-cooling regime that should be instrumental to boost the kilowatt capabilities of next generation high-power lasers.

An outstanding challenge in optical antenna design lies in achieving high radiation efficiency, ultra-compact footprint and broad radiation angle simultaneously, as required for dense 2D OPAs with a broad steering range. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally new concept of a nanophotonic antenna based on near-field phase-engineering. By introducing a specific near-field phase factor in the Fraunhofer transformation, the far-field beam is widened beyond the diffraction limit for a given aperture size. We use transversally interleaved subwavelength grating nanostructures to control the near-field phase. The antenna reaches a radiation efficiency of 82%, a compact footprint of 3.1 um * 1.75 um and an ultra-broad far-field beam width of 52{\\deg} and 62{\\deg} in the longitudinal and transversal direction, respectively. This unprecedented design performance is achieved with a single-etch grating nanostructure in a 300-nm SOI platform. ",

Comprehensive spectroscopic (core level and valence band XPS, FTIR, Raman) and microscopic (AFM and STEM) characterizations confirm the growth of BN thin films on GaN. Optically, we observed that BN/GaN heterostructure is second-harmonic generation active. Moreover, we fabricated the BN/GaN heterostructure-based Schottky diode that demonstrates rectifying characteristics, lower turn-on voltage, and an improved breakdown capability (234 V) as compared to GaN (168 V), owing to the higher breakdown electrical field of BN. Our approach is an early step towards bridging the gap between wide and ultrawide-bandgap materials for potential optoelectronics as well as next-generation high-power electronics. ",

To overcome these difficulties, a machine-learning potential (MLP) was examined in this work for modeling LBS glasses using DeepMD. The glass structures obtained by this MLP possessed fourhold-coordinated boron ($^4$B) confirmed well with the experimental data and abundance of three-membered rings. The models were energetically more stable compared with those constructed with a functional force-field even though both the models included reasonable $^4$B. The results confirmed MLP to be superior to model the boron-containing glasses and address the inherent shortcomings of the AIMD and CMD.

We propose a quantum reservoir processor to harness quantum dynamics in computational tasks requiring both classical and quantum inputs. This analog processor comprises a network of quantum dots in which quantum data is incident to the network and classical data is encoded via a coherent field exciting the network. We perform a multitasking application of quantum tomography and nonlinear equalization of classical channels. Interestingly, the tomography can be performed in a closed-loop manner via the feedback control of classical data. Therefore, if the classical input comes from a dynamical system, embedding this system in a closed loop enables hybrid processing even if access to the external classical input is interrupted. Finally, we demonstrate preparing quantum depolarizing channels as a novel quantum machine learning technique for quantum data processing. ",
