    "abstract": "Optical Ising machines promise to solve complex optimization problems with an optical hardware acceleration advantage. Here we study the ground state properties of a nonlinear optical Ising machine realized by spatial light modulator, Fourier optics, and second harmonic generation in a nonlinear crystal. By tuning the ratio of the light intensities at the fundamental and second harmonic frequencies, we experimentally observe two distinct ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transitions: a second-order phase transition where the magnetization changes to zero continuously and a first-order phase transition where the magnetization drops to zero abruptly as the effective temperature increases. Our experimental results are corroborated by a numerical simulation based on the Monte Carlo Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the physical mechanism for the distinct phase transitions can be understood with a mean-field theory. Our results showcase the great flexibility of the nonlinear optical Ising machine, which may find important potential applications in solving combinatorial optimization problems. ",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) proton planning with only transmission beams (TBs) has limitations in normal tissue sparing. The single-energy spread-out Bragg peaks (SESOBPs) of FLASH dose rate have been demonstrated feasible for proton FLASH planning. A hybrid inverse optimization method was developed to combine the TBs and SESOBPs (TB-SESOBP) for FLASH planning. The SESOBPs were generated from spreading out the BPs by pre-designed general bar ridge filters and placed at the central target by range shifters to obtain a uniform dose within the target. The SESOBPs and TBs were fully sampled field-by-field allowing automatic spot selection and weighting in the optimization process. The TB-SESOBP plans were validated in comparison with the TB only (TB-only) plans and the plans with the combination of TBs and BPs (TB-BP) regarding 3D dose and dose rate distributions for five lung cases. Comparing to the TB-only plans, the mean spinal cord D1.2cc drastically reduced 41%, the mean lung V7Gy and V7.4Gy moderately reduced by up to 17% and the target dose homogeneity slightly increased in the TB-SESOBP plans. Comparable dose homogeneity was achieved in both TB-SESOBP and TB-BP plans. Besides, prominent improvements were achieved in lung sparing for the cases of relatively large targets by the TB-SESOBP plans comparing to the TB-BP plans. The targets were fully covered with the FLASH dose rate in all the three plans. For the OARs, V40Gy/s = 100% was achieved by the TB-only plans while V40Gy/s > 85% was obtained by the other two plans. We have demonstrated that the hybrid TB-SESOBP planning was feasible to achieve FLASH dose rate for proton therapy. The hybrid TB-SESOBP planning has great potential in improving OAR sparing while maintaining high target dose homogeneity, and can be potentially implemented for adaptive radiotherapy. ",

Experiments in these domains often address molecular vibrations in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region, thus generating the need for spectrally pure and accurate MIR laser sources. Quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) have emerged as flexible sources of coherent radiation available over a wide range of MIR frequencies. Here, we demonstrate a robust approach for the simultaneous linewidth narrowing, frequency stabilisation, and absolute frequency referencing of MIR QCLs all of which are prerequisites for precise spectroscopic experiments. Following upconversion of its radiation to the visible domain, we implement a phase lock of the QCL to a linewidth-narrowed optical frequency comb which is referenced to a remote SI-traceable primary frequency standard via a fibre link for absolute frequency calibration. To achieve a reliable frequency counting of the beat note between the QCL and the OFC, we employ redundant tracking oscillators and demonstrate a frequency instability of $5\\times10^{-13}$ at 1 s and $2\\times10^{-14}$ at 1000 s integration time, limited by the accuracy of our remote reference.

Their realisation requires multiport beam splitters, which has been a long-standing challenge in free-space and integrated optics. Here, we propose a new type of multiport interferometers suitable for implementation on optical chips. Their prospective advantages over the standard directional-coupler architectures: an arbitrary number of arms, planar architecture and two orders of magnitude reduction in footprint, are achieved by the layout based exclusively on the finite modulated photonic lattices. The inverse design of photonic lattices is facilitated by restricting the light propagation to periodic patterns. The corresponding interferometer model predicts the maximum $1/\\sqrt{N}$ sensitivity scaling with the number of arms $N$. While the presented design solutions are ubiquitous to all implementations, the advantages are discussed in both the low and high refractive-index contrast platforms. Finally, we provide an outlook on the possibilities for the interferometer applications in distributed classical and quantum measurements. ",

    "abstract": "Due to limitations in available sensor technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) lack an active sensing capability to measure turbulence, gusts, or other unsteady aerodynamic phenomena. Conventional in situ anemometry techniques fail to deliver in the harsh and dynamic multirotor environment due to form factor, resolution, or robustness requirements. To address this capability gap, a novel, fast-response sensor system to measure a wind vector in two dimensions is introduced and evaluated. This system, known as `MAST' (for MEMS Anemometry Sensing Tower), leverages advances in microelectromechanical (MEMS) hot-wire devices to produce a solid-state, lightweight, and robust flow sensor suitable for real-time wind estimation onboard a UAV. The MAST uses five pentagonally-arranged microscale hot-wires to determine the wind vector's direction and magnitude. The MAST's performance was evaluated in a wind tunnel at speeds up to 5~m/s and orientations of 0 - 360 degrees. A neural network sensor model was trained from the wind tunnel data to estimate the wind vector from sensor signals. The average error of the sensor is 0.14 m/s for speed and 1.6 degrees for direction. Furthermore, 95% of measurements are within 0.36 m/s error for speed and 5.0 degree error for direction. With a bandwidth of 570 Hz determined from square-wave testing, the MAST stands to greatly enhance UAV wind estimation capabilities and enable capturing relevant high-frequency phenomena in flow conditions.

Using theoretical analysis and fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that relativistic topological waves can be generated via Cherenkov and Doppler resonances in the interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with near-critical-density plasmas. At the self-magnetized plasma-plasma interface, a new slow-wave branch appears. Its phase velocity is much smaller than the group velocity of the laser pulse and the electron beam velocity. Therefore, the Cherenkov resonance condition can be easily satisfied. Furthermore, since electrons undergo betatron oscillations, Doppler resonances may also occur and are responsible for the excitation of several frequency-shifted branches observed in our simulations. After the passage of the laser pulse, we observe a fast remnant mode with relativistic amplitude and frequency close to the local plasma frequency. This mode continues to accelerate electrons further for many tens of laser periods even after the laser pulse has left the plasma. ",

The time-dependent Schroedinger equation is solved to calculate the ATI energy spectrum, and a qualitative understanding of the electron motion after ionization is explored using a classical model that solves Newton's equation of motion. Results are presented for Gaussian and Airy laser pulses with identical spectral intensities, but differing spectral phases. The simulations show that the third order spectral phase of the Airy pulse, which alters the temporal envelope of the electric field, causes changes to the timing of ionization and the dynamics of the rescattering process. Specifically, the use of Airy pulses in the ATI process results in a shift of the Keldysh plateau cutoff to lower energy due to a decreased pondermotive energy of the electron in the laser field. A reduced electron yield is also observed for the low-energy direct electrons liberated by an Airy pulse. Additionally, the side lobes of the Airy laser pulse change the number and timing of rescattering events, which results in changes to the high-order ATI plateau. ",

However, predicting molecular spectra accurately is computationally difficult because of the presence of entanglement between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Although quantum computers promise to reduce this computational cost, existing quantum approaches rely on combining signals from individual eigenstates, an approach that is difficult to scale because the number of eigenstates grows exponentially with molecule size. Here, we introduce a method for scalable analog quantum simulation of molecular spectroscopy, by performing simulations in the time domain. Our approach can treat more complicated molecular models than previous ones, requires fewer approximations, and can be extended to open quantum systems with minimal overhead. We present a direct mapping of the underlying problem of time-domain simulation of molecular spectra to the degrees of freedom and control fields available in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. We experimentally demonstrate our algorithm on a trapped-ion device, exploiting both intrinsic electronic and motional degrees of freedom, showing excellent quantitative agreement for a single-mode vibronic photoelectron spectrum of SO$_2$.

    "abstract": "A critical consideration in the design of next generation gravitational wave detectors is isolation from seismic vibrations that introduces various coherent and incoherent noises to the interferometers at different frequencies. We present the results of a detailed low frequency ambient seismic noise characterization (0.1--10~Hz) at Gingin High Optical Power Facility in Western Australia using a seismic array. The dominant noise sources below 1~Hz is microseism (0.06--1~Hz), strongly correlated with swell and sea heights measured by nearby buoy stations. Above 1~Hz, the seismic spectrum is dominated by wind induced seismic noise with a diurnal variation that prevents characterizing the background anthropogenic noise sources based on their daily power variations. We use f-k beamforming to distinguish between coherent and incoherent wind induced seismic noise. This allows the separation of some anthropogenic noise from wind induced noise based on the temporal variation of spatio-spectral properties. We show that the seismic coherency is reduced by wind induced seismic noise for wind speeds above 6~m/s. Furthermore, there are several spectral peaks between 4--9~Hz associated with the interaction of wind with a 40~m tall tower among which one at 4.2~Hz is strongest and coherent. By comparing our results with the properties of seismic noise at Virgo, we demonstrate that while the secondary microseism noise level is two orders of magnitude higher in Gingin (0.2~Hz), the anthropogenic noise level is three orders of magnitude lower between 2 and 4~Hz due to the absence of nearby road traffic. It is also at least one order of magnitude lower between 4 and 10~Hz due to the sparse population in Gingin. ",
