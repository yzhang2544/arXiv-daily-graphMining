    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we present high spatial resolution focusing of electromagnetic waves at telecommunication wavelengths ({\\lambda}0 = 1.55 {\\mu}m) by using high-refractive index mesoscale dielectrics placed at the end of an optical fiber. Our approach exploits photonic nanojets (PNJs) to achieve high-intensity, spatially narrow focal spots. The response of the device is evaluated in detail considering 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) configurations using high-index mesoscale cylindrical and spherical dielectrics, respectively, placed on top of an optical fiber. It is shown how the PNJs can be shifted towards the output surface of the mesoscale high-index dielectric by simply truncating its 2D/3D cylindrical/spherical output profile. With this setup, a PNJ with a high transversal resolution is obtained using the 2D/3D engineered mesoscale dielectric particles achieving a Full-Width at Half-Maximum of FWHM = 0.28{\\lambda}0 (2D truncated dielectric), and FWHMy = 0.17{\\lambda}0 and FWHMx = 0.21{\\lambda}0 (3D truncated dielectric). The proposed structure may have potential in applications where near-field high spatial resolution is required, such as in sensing and imaging systems. ",

    "abstract": "Pedal wavemakers that generate surface gravity waves through bed orbital motion have been shown to produce particle-excursion patterns that mimic deep-water wave behaviour but in finite-depth channels. In this article, we report that gravity waves in a general viscous fluid can resonate through the action of pedal wavemakers. We analyse the linear response of waves in an infinite channel in terms of the displacement amplitude, frequency, and wavelength of the bottom action. We show that the system behaves as a long-pass filter in space and a high-pass filter in time with a sharp resonance affected by viscosity. Furthermore, we propose a protocol to design deep gravity waves with an on-demand wavelength in a finite-depth water channel. Our theoretical framework agrees with numerical simulations using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Our results thus quantify the performance of pedal wavemakers and provide essential formulas for industrial and computational applications of the pedal wavemaking technique, useful both in hydraulics and coastal engineering problems.

    "abstract": "Mode-locked lasers play a key role in modern science and technology. Not only do they lay the foundation for ultrafast optics and play a central role in nonlinear optics, but also they have important applications in imaging, telecommunications, sensing, and computing. While substantial efforts have focused on mode-locking the spectral modes of lasers, relatively little attention has been paid to mode-locking their temporal modes. However, temporal mode-locking presents ample opportunities to develop new technologies and to study the intersection of nonlinear, non-Hermitian, and topological phenomena, which, in recent years, has been a priority for the field of topological physics. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally realize topological temporal mode-locking in a laser cavity with time-delayed intracavity couplings. These couplings introduce non-Hermitian point-gap topology into the temporal modes of our laser and conspire with an effective nonlocal nonlinearity to generate mode-locked temporal structures in our laser cavity, whose form can be tailored by suitably engineering the underlying couplings. We harness this approach to realize a nonlinearity-driven non-Hermitian skin effect, and we show that the topological temporal modes of our laser are robust against disorder-induced localization. The flexibility and programmability of our topological temporal mode-locking scheme reveals new opportunities to study nonlinear and non-Hermitian topological phenomena in mode-locked photonic resonators and could enable new applications of mode-locked lasers to sensing and optical computing.

    "abstract": "Phonon polariton modes in layered anisotropic heterostructures are a key building block for modern nanophotonic technologies. The light-matter interaction for evanescent excitation of such a multilayer system can be theoretically described by a transfer matrix formalism. This method allows to compute the imaginary part of the p-polarized reflection coefficient Im$(r_{pp})$, which is typically used to analyze the polariton dispersion of the multilayer structure, but lacks the possibility to access the layer-resolved polaritonic response. We present an approach to compute the layer-resolved polariton resonance intensity in aribtrarily anisotropic layered heterostructures, based on calculating the Poynting vector extracted from a transfer matrix formalism. Our approach is independent of the experimental excitation conditions, and fulfills an empirical conservation law. As a test ground, we study two state-of-the-art nanophotonic multilayer systems, covering strong coupling and tunable hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in twisted \\MoO~double layers. Providing a new level of insight into the polaritonic response, our method holds great potential for understanding, optimizing and predicting new forms of polariton heterostructures in the future. ",

Here, we discuss a complementary picture, in which we describe the propagation and scattering of light in the atomic medium, which provides a complex susceptibility and scatterers. This ``optical picture'' is valid in the linear-optics regime for disordered samples and is mainly relevant at low density, when the susceptibility and scattering cross-section can be computed from simple textbook formulas. In this picture, superradiance is a dispersion effect due to a single scattering event dressed by an effective refractive index, whereas subradiance is due to multiple scattering. We present numerical and experimental data supporting our interpretation. ",

    "abstract": "The Fenna-Mathews-Olson (FMO) complex present in green sulphur bacteria are known to mediate the transfer of excitation energy between light-harvesting chlorosomes and membrane-embedded bacterial reaction centres. Due to high efficiency of such transport process, it is an extensively studied pigment-protein complex system with the eventual aim of modelling and engineering similar dynamics in other systems and use it for real time application. Some studies have attributed the enhancement of transport efficiency to wave-like behaviour and non-Markovian quantum jumps resulting in long lived and revival of quantum coherence, respectively. Since dynamics in these systems resides in quantum-classical regime, quantum simulation of such dynamics will help in exploring the subtle role of quantum features in enhancing the transport efficiency which has remained unsettled. Discrete quantum simulation of the FMO complex dynamics can help in efficient engineering of the heat bath and controlling the environment with the system. In this work, using the discrete quantum simulation framework we quantify and show that the non-Markovian memory effects are present in specific site-pairs when internal structures and environmental effects are in favour of faster transport. As a consequence, our study lean towards the connection between non-Markovianity in the quantum jumps with the enhancement of transport efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of MRI and patient data on the prediction of knee osteoarthritis (OA) incidence using different deep learning architectures. Knee OA incidence within 24 months was predicted using the intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (IW-TSE) sequence of 593 patients from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. To extract a region of interest containing the knee joint from the IW-TSE sequence, a U-Net model was trained and used to segment bone on a dual echo steady state (DESS) sequence. Subsequently, IW-TSE and DESS sequences were registered and the DESS segmentations were transformed to the corresponding IW-TSE scans. The performance of MRI-based features in the prediction of knee OA incidence was tested using three different deep learning architectures: a residual network (ResNet), a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), and a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE). To evaluate the predictive performance of MRI-based features alone, the outputs of ResNet, DenseNet, and CVAE were coupled with patient data (i.e., age, gender, BMI) and used as input to a Logistic Regression (LR) Classifier. Knee OA was defined based on visual MRI and X-ray-based OA features. The ResNet and DenseNet showed similar results, with both methods having the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values up to 0.6269. The best performing OA detection model was CVAE with an AUC of 0.6699 when combined with patient data and an AUC of 0.6689 when used alone as input to the LR classifier. The results showed that three deep learning algorithms have similar metrics when using IW-TSE MRIs and their performance increased with the inclusion of patient data, which shows the strong influence of variables such as age, gender, and BMI on the detection of knee OA.

    "abstract": "The formalism of the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) is an effective tool to simultaneously increase the accuracy and the efficiency of the predictions of quasiclassical trajectory methods in the simulation of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics. The GQME expresses correlation functions in terms of a non-Markovian equation of motion, involving memory kernels which are typically fast-decaying and can therefore be computed by short-time quasiclassical trajectories. In this paper we study the approximate solution of the GQME, obtained by calculating the kernels with two methods, namely Ehrenfest mean-field theory and spin mapping. We test the approaches on a range of spin-boson models with increasing energy bias between the two electronic levels and place a particular focus on the long-time limits of the populations. We find that the accuracy of the predictions of the GQME depends strongly on the specific technique used to calculate the kernels. In particular, spin mapping outperforms Ehrenfest for all systems studied. The problem of unphysical negative electronic populations affecting spin mapping is resolved (at least in these cases) by coupling the method with the master equation. Conversely, Ehrenfest in conjunction with the GQME can predict negative populations, despite the fact that the populations calculated from direct dynamics are positive definite. ",

In this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to PNR QND using quadratic (i.e., $\\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinear interactions. We show that the coherent pump field driving a phase-mismatched optical parametric amplifier (OPA) experiences displacements conditioned on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations. A measurement of the pump displacement thus provides a QND measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized for deterministically generating Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states only with additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for fault-tolerant QIP in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND schemes into a more traditional context by highlighting analogies between the phase-mismatched optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity QED systems, by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in near-term $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear nanophotonics, highlighting the rich potential of OPA as a universal tool for ultrafast non-Gaussian quantum state engineering and quantum computation.

Quantum effects are explicitly included throughout, both in (a) defining network components via projection operators, and (b) in determining the role of coherences in rate processes. As examples, the methodology is applied to model cases, two versions of the V-level system, and to the spin-boson model, wherein the role of the environment and of internal system properties in determining the rates is examined.
