    "abstract": "Random lasers are promising in the spectral regime, wherein conventional lasers are unavailable, with advantages of low fabrication costs and applicability of diverse gain materials. However, their practical application is hindered by high threshold powers, low power efficiency, and difficulties in light collection. Here, we demonstrate a power-efficient easy-to-fabricate non-resonant laser using a deep hole on a porous gain material. The laser action in this counterintuitive cavity was enabled by nonresonant feedback from strong diffuse reflections on the inner surface. Additionally, significant enhancements in slope efficiency, threshold power, and directionality were obtained from cavities fabricated on a porous Nd:YAG ceramic. ",

    "abstract": "Balanced homodyne interferometry is a well-known detection technique that allows for sensitive characterization of light fields. Conventionally a homodyne interferometer is operated by locking the relative phase of a reference beam to the signal beam by means of an active feedback loop. A less often used method is to perform a slow continuous modulation of the reference beam arm length that corresponds to averaging all relative phases during the measurement.Here we show theoretically and experimentally that this quadrature averaging can be advantageous in estimating the parameters of a resonant optical cavity. We demonstrate that the averaging turns the transduction function, from cavity frequency fluctuations into the interferometer signal, into a simple function of the laser detuning that, notably, does not depend on the parameters of possible non-resonant channels present in the system. The method needs no active feedback and gives results that are easy to interpret. Moreover, the phase-averaged measurement allows to characterize the absolute magnitude of a cavity frequency modulation. ",

    "abstract": "Recent theory of the light-induced medium magnetization (inverse Faraday effect, IFE) performed by a transversely-limited circularly-polarized light beam [Phys. Rev. B 91, 020411 (2015)] predicts the existence of a \"demagnetization current\" (DC) at the beam periphery which, apparently, acts oppositely to the light-induced rotational motion of the charge carriers inside the beam and thus reduces the IFE by the factor of 2. In this note, taking the longitudinal component of the beam into account, we show that the peripheral DC is two times higher than was calculated before. Nevertheless, this circumstance does not cancel the IFE because the DC, as a sort of Stokes-drift current in plasma [Phys. Rev. E 105, 065208 (2022)], is accompanied by the additional \"magnetization current\" of the opposite direction. ",

    "abstract": "We propose further development of the resonant mode coupling approximation for the calculation of optical spectra of stacked periodic nanostructures in terms of the scattering matrix. We previously showed that given the resonant input and output vectors as well as background scattering matrices of two subsystems, one can easily calculate those for the combined system comprising two subsystems. It allows us to write a resonant approximation for the combined system and speed up calculation significantly for typical calculation problems. The main drawback of this approach is that the background matrix in such approximation was considered constant which is not always sufficient if the energy range of interest is relatively wide. The aim of this article is to solve this problem by utilizing more complicated approximations for the background matrices. In particular, we show that consideration of energy-dependent correction terms for the background matrices remarkably reduces the resonant energies' calculation error. Here we first consider a linear approximation, and although it is not suitable for large energy ranges, it is used as a base for a piecewise-linear approximation which allows one to keep the approximation error negligibly small with only a few sample points. Moreover, interpolation of the background matrices allows one to apply resonant mode coupling approximation in almost arbitrary large energy ranges. We also consider approximation of background matrices by an arbitrary matrix function and propose a technique to derive the resonant poles in this case. The methods described here could be considered as an alternative approach for calculation of optical spectra stacked systems. ",

    "abstract": "High resolution polarization maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are on high demand, since the discovery of primordial B-Modes in the polarization patterns would confirm the inflationary phase of the Universe that would have taken place before the emission of the CMB. Transition Edge Sensors (TES) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) are the predominant detector technologies of cryogenic detector array based CMB instruments that search for primordial B-Modes. In this paper we propose another type of cryogenic detector to be used for CMB survey: A magnetic microbolometer (MMB) that is based on a paramagnetic temperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study of neutrino mass. A complete simulation framework was developed that accounts for the electrical and thermal properties of the bolometer and that can be used to obtain its responsivity and bandwidth, as well as estimating noise. A brief proof of concept case study is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurements and reliable microfabrication processes, to assess the suitability of metallic magnetic sensors in CMB experiments. The results show that MMBs provide a promising technology for CMB polarization measurements as their sensitivity can be tuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneously maintaining a low time response to avoid degradation of the point-source response of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabrication techniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a change of detector technology would even come with very low cost. ",

We found no correspondence with observations. Since the implications of the new time dilation/contraction and frequency shift are blatantly paradoxical, we do not expect to find one.

We analyze the trade-off between measurement imprecision and back-action noise and show that optical detection beyond the standard quantum limit can be achieved. We predict that, with state-of-the-art squeezed light sources, laser recoil heating reduction of at least $60\\%$ can be attained by squeezing a single Gaussian mode with an appropriate incidence direction.
