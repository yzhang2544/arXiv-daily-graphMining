    "abstract": "Photophoretic forces could levitate thin 10 centimeter-scale structures in Earth$'$s stratosphere indefinitely. We develop models of the thermal transpiration lofting force on a bilayer sandwich structure under stratospheric conditions driven by radiative fluxes in the thermal-infrared and solar-band. Similar structures have been levitated in the laboratory. Lofting is maximized when the layers are separated by an air gap equal to the mean free path (MFP), when about half of the layers$'$ surface area consists of holes with radii < MFP, and when the top layer is solar-transmissive and infrared-emissive while the bottom layer is solar-absorptive and infrared-transmissive. We describe a preliminary design of a 10 cm diameter device that combines a levitating structure made of two membranes 2 $\\mu$m apart with the support structure required for stiffness and orientation control. We limit the design to components that could be fabricated with available methods. Structural analysis suggests that the device would have sufficient strength to withstand forces that might be encountered in transport, deployment, and flight. Our models predict a payload capacity of about 300 mg at 25 km altitude and our analysis suggests it could support bidirectional radio communication at over 10 Mb/s and could have limited navigational abilities. Such devices could be useful for atmospheric science or telecommunications, and similar devices might be useful on Mars. Structures a few times larger might have payloads of a few grams. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To propose COMPaS, a learning-free Convolutional Network, that combines Deep Image Prior (DIP) with transform-domain sparsity constraints to reconstruct undersampled Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data without previous training of the network. Methods: COMPaS uses a U-Net as DIP for undersampledMRdata in the image domain. Reconstruction is constrained by data fidelity to k-space measurements and transform-domain sparsity, such as Total Variation (TV) or Wavelet transform sparsity. Two-dimensional MRI data from the public FastMRI dataset with Cartesian undersampling in phase-encoding direction were reconstructed for different acceleration rates (R) from R = 2 to R = 8 for single coil and multicoil data. Performance of the proposed architecture was compared to Parallel Imaging with Compressed Sensing (PICS). Results: COMPaS outperforms standard PICS algorithms by reducing ghosting artifacts and yielding higher quantitative reconstruction quality metrics in multicoil imaging settings and especially in single coil k-space reconstruction. Furthermore, COMPaS can reconstruct multicoil data without explicit knowledge of coil sensitivity profiles. Conclusion: COMPaS utilizes a training-free convolutional network as a DIP in MRI reconstruction and transforms it with transform-domain sparsity regularization. It is a competitive algorithm for parallel imaging and a novel tool for accelerating single coil MRI. ",

We propose and demonstrate a QND measurement scheme for the spin states of laser-trapped atoms. On $^{171}$Yb atoms held in an optical dipole trap, a transition that is simultaneously cycling, spin-state selective, and spin-state preserving is created by introducing a circularly polarized beam of control laser to optically dress the spin states in the excited level, while leaving the spin states in the ground level unperturbed. We measure the phase of spin precession of $5\\times10^{4}$ atoms in a bias magnetic field of 20 mG. This QND approach reduces the optical absorption detection noise by $\\sim$19 dB, to a level of 2.3 dB below the atomic quantum projection noise. In addition to providing a general approach for efficient spin-state readout, this all-optical technique allows quick switching and real-time programming for quantum sensing and quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "Compact, high-speed electro-optic phase modulators play a vital role in various large-scale applications including phased arrays, quantum and neural networks, and optical communication links. Conventional phase modulators suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between device length and optical loss that limits their scaling capabilities. High-finesse ring resonators have been traditionally used as compact intensity modulators, but their use for phase modulation have been limited due to the high insertion loss associated with the phase change. Here, we show that high-finesse resonators can achieve a strong phase change with low insertion loss by simultaneous modulation of the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, to the same extent i.e. $\\frac{\\Delta n}{\\Delta k} \\sim 1$. To implement this strategy, we utilize a hybrid platform that combines a low-loss SiN ring resonator with electro-absorptive graphene (Gr) and electro-refractive WSe$_2$. We achieve a phase modulation efficiency ($V_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cdot L_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$) of 0.045 V $\\cdot$ cm with an insertion loss (IL$_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$) of 4.7 dB for a phase change of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians, in a 25 $\\mu$m long Gr-Al$_2$O$_3$-WSe$_2$ capacitor embedded on a SiN ring of 50 $\\mu$m radius. We find that our Gr-Al$_2$O$_3$-WSe$_2$ capacitor can support an electro-optic bandwidth of 14.9 $\\pm$ 0.1 GHz. We further show that the $V_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cdot L_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ of our SiN-2D platform is at least an order of magnitude lower than that of electro-optic phase modulators based on silicon, III-V on silicon, graphene on silicon and lithium niobate. This SiN-2D hybrid platform provides the impetus to design compact and high-speed reconfigurable circuits with graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers that can enable large-scale photonic systems.

    "abstract": "For all-optical communication and information processing, it is necessary to develop all-optical logic gates based on photonic structures that can directly perform logic operations. All-optical logic gates have been demonstrated based on conventional waveguides and interferometry, as well as photonic crystal structures. Nonetheless, any defects in those structures will introduce high scattering loss, which compromises the fidelity and contrast ratio of the information process. Based on the spin-valley locking effect that can achieve defect-immune unidirectional transmission of topological edge states in valley photonic crystals (VPCs), we propose a high-performance all-optical logic OR gate based on a VPC structure. By tuning the working bandwidth of the two input channels, we prevent interference between the two channels to achieve a stable and high-fidelity output. The transmittance of both channels is higher than 0.8, and a high contrast ratio of 28.8 dB is achieved. Moreover, the chirality of the logic gate originated from the spin-valley locking effect allows using different circularly polarized light as inputs, representing \"1\" or \"0\", which is highly desired in quantum computing. The device's footprint is small, allowing high-density on-chip integration. In addition, this design can be experimentally fabricated using current nanofabrication techniques and will have potential applications in optical communication, information processing, and quantum computing.

In this study, we present the design, simulation, and experimental demonstration of compact and ultra-broadband silicon photonic filters with adiabatic waveguides. We first develop an optimization algorithm for coupled adiabatic waveguide structures, and use it to design individual, single-cutoff spectral filters. These single-cutoff filters are 1x2 port devices that optimally separate a broadband signal into short-pass and long-pass outputs, within a specified device length. We control the power roll-off and extinction ratio in these filters using the adiabaticity parameter. Both outputs of the filters operate in transmission, making it possible to cascade multiple filters in different configurations. Taking advantage of this flexibility, we cascade two filters with different cutoff wavelengths on-chip, and experimentally demonstrate band-pass operation. The independent and flexible design of these band edges enables filters with bandwidths well over 100 nm. Experimentally, we demonstrate band-pass filters with passbands ranging from 6.4 nm up to 96.6 nm. Our devices achieve flat-band transmission in all three of the short-pass, band-pass, and long-pass outputs with less than 1.5 dB insertion loss and extinction ratios of over 15 dB. These ultra-broadband filters can enable new capabilities for multi-band integrated photonics in communications, spectroscopy, and sensing applications. ",

    "abstract": "Should it be a pebble hitting water surface or an explosion taking place underwater, concentric surface waves inevitably propagate. Except for possibly early times of the impact, finite amplitude concentric water waves emerge from a balance between dispersion or nonlinearity resulting in solitary waves. While stability of plane solitary waves on deep and shallow water has been extensively studied, there are no analogous analyses for concentric solitary waves. On shallow water, the equation governing soliton formation -- the nearly concentric Korteweg-de Vries -- has been deduced before without surface tension, so we extend the derivation onto the surface tension case. On deep water, the envelope equation is traditionally thought to be the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger type originally derived in the Cartesian coordinates. However, with a systematic derivation in cylindrical coordinates suitable for studying concentric waves we demonstrate that the appropriate envelope equation must be amended with an inverse-square potential, thus leading to a Gross-Pitaevskii equation instead. Properties of both models for deep and shallow water cases are studied in detail, including conservation laws and the base states corresponding to axisymmetric solitary waves. Stability analyses of the latter lead to singular eigenvalue problems, which dictate the use of analytical tools. We identify the conditions resulting in the transverse instability of the concentric solitons revealing crucial differences from their plane counterparts. Of particular interest here are the effects of surface tension and cylindrical geometry on the occurrence of transverse instability. ",

Highly confined silicon photonics promises extreme scale and functional integration. However, the optical modes of silicon nanowire waveguides and optical fibres are very different, making efficient fibre-chip coupling a challenge. Vertical grating couplers, the dominant coupling method today, have limited optical bandwidth and are naturally out-of-plane. Here we demonstrate a new method that is low-loss, broadband, easily manufacturable, and naturally planar. We adiabatically couple a tapering silicon nanowire waveguide to a conic nanotapered optical fibre, measuring transmission between 2.0 and 2.2 micron wavelength. The silicon chip is fabricated at a commercial foundry and then post-processed to release the tapering nanowires. We estimate an optimal per-coupler transmission of -0.48 dB (maximum; 95% confidence interval [+0.46, -1.68] dB) and a 1-dB bandwidth of 295 nm . With automated measurements, we quantify the device tolerance to lateral misalignment, measuring a flat response within +/- 0.968 micron.

    "abstract": "Non-adiabatic chemical reactions involving continuous circularly polarized light (cw CPL) have not attracted as much attention as dynamics in unpolarized/linearly polarized light. However, including circularly (in contrast to linearly) polarized light allows one to effectively introduce a complex-valued time-dependent Hamiltonian, which offers a new path for control or exploration through the introduction of Berry forces. Here, we investigate several inexpensive semiclassical approaches for modeling such nonadiabatic dynamics in the presence of a time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonian, beginning with a straightforward instantaneous adiabatic fewest-switches surface hopping (IA-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and time), continuing to a standard Floquet fewest switches surface hopping (F-FSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position and frequency), and ending with an exotic Floquet phase-space surface hopping (F-PSSH) approach (where the electronic states depend on position, frequency, and momentum). Using a set of model systems with time-dependent complex-valued Hamiltonians, we show that the Floquet phase-space adiabats are the optimal choice of basis as far as accounting for Berry phase effects and delivering accuracy. Thus, the F-PSSH algorithm sets the stage for modeling nonadiabatic dynamics under strong externally pumped circular polarization in the future. ",

We implemented these quantum circuits on IBM quantum processors, using a single qubit to represent independent photons traveling through the LIGO interferometer and two entangled qubits to illustrate the improved sensitivity that LIGO has achieved by using non-classical states of light. The one-qubit interferometer illustrates how projection noise in the measurement of independent photons corresponds to phase sensitivity at the standard quantum limit. In the presence of technical noise on a real quantum computer, this interferometer achieves the sensitivity of 11\\% above the standard quantum limit. The two-qubit interferometer demonstrates how entanglement circumvents the limits imposed by the quantum shot noise, achieving the phase sensitivity 17\\% below the standard quantum limit.

That is, interference is not completely well-defined for states with different 3d-space geometries, even if their linear combination is. The dissociation into 3d-space geometries still allows for interference at small scales, but precludes it at macro scales. It grants the possibility of classical-looking macroscopic objects, including measuring devices. Counting the 3d-space geometries automatically gives the Born rule. But the wavefunction collapse turns out to be even more ad-hoc. Fortunately, the dissociation entails a kind of absolute decoherence, making the wavefunction collapse unnecessary. This naturally leads to a new version of the many-worlds interpretation, while solving its major problems: 1) the classical-3d-space states form an absolute preferred basis, 2) at any instant, the resulting branches look like classical worlds, with objects in the 3d-space, 3) the 3d-space geometries converge at the Big-Bang, favoring branching towards the future, 4) macro-branches stop interfering, even though micro-branches can interfere, 5) the coefficients $\\Psi[\\gamma,\\phi]$ become real by absorbing the complex phases in the global U(1) gauge, 6) the ontology is a state vector uniquely dissociable into many gauged classical-3d-space states, each of them counting as a world by having local beables (the classical fields), 7) the density of the classical-3d-space states automatically obeys the Born rule.

    "title": "Collective Excitation of Spatio-Spectrally Distinct Quantum Dots Enabled  by Chirped Pulses",
    "abstract": "For a scalable photonic device producing entangled photons, it is desirable to have multiple quantum emitters in an ensemble that can be collectively excited, despite their spectral variability. For quantum dots, Rabi rotation, the most popular method for resonant excitation, cannot assure a universal, highly efficient excited state preparation, because of its sensitivity to the excitation parameters. In contrast, Adiabatic Rapid Passage (ARP), relying on chirped optical pulses, is immune to quantum dot spectral inhomogeneity. Here, we advocate the robustness of ARP for simultaneous excitation of the biexciton states of multiple quantum dots. For positive chirps, we find that there is also regime of phonon advantage that widens the tolerance range of spectral detunings. Using the same laser pulse we demonstrate the simultaneous excitation of energetically and spatially distinct quantum dots. Being able to generate spatially multiplexed entangled photon pairs is a big step towards the scalability of photonic devices. ",

    "title": "Strong effects of fast collisions between pulsed optical beams in a  linear medium with weak cubic loss",
    "abstract": "We investigate fast collisions between pulsed optical beams in a linear medium with weak cubic loss that arises due to nondegenerate two-photon absorption. We introduce a perturbation method with two small parameters and use it to obtain general formulas for the collision-induced changes in the pulsed-beam's shape and amplitude. Moreover, we use the method to design and characterize collision setups that lead to strong localized and nonlocalized intensity reduction effects. The values of the collision-induced changes in the pulsed-beam's shape in both setups are larger by one to two orders of magnitude compared with the values obtained in previous studies of fast two-pulse collisions. Furthermore, we show that for nonlocalized setups, the graph of the collision-induced amplitude shift vs the difference between the first-order dispersion coefficients for the two pulsed-beams has two local minima. This finding represents the first observation of a deviation of the graph from the common funnel shape that was obtained in all previous studies of fast two-pulse collisions in the presence of weak nonlinear loss. The predictions of our perturbation theory are in good agreement with results of numerical simulations with the perturbed linear propagation model, despite the strong collision-induced effects. Our results can be useful for multisequence optical communication links and for reshaping of pulsed optical beams. ",
