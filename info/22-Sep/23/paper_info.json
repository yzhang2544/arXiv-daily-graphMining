    "abstract": "This work presents a detailed analysis of the photothermionic-photovoltaic hybrid solar device. The electrons in this hybrid device gain energy from both the solar photons and thermophotons generated within the device, and hence the device has the potential to offer a voltage boost compared to individual photothermionic or photovoltaic devices. We show that the gap size between the photothermionic emitter and the photovoltaic collector crucially affects the device performance due to the strong dependence of the electronic and photonic coupling strengths on this gap size. We also investigate how the current matching constraint between the thermionic and photovoltaic stages can affect the hybrid solar device performance by studying different hybrid device configurations. Moreover, the hybrid devices are compared with the single photothermionic solar device with a metallic collector. Interestingly, we observe that the addition of a photovoltaic stage meant to enable the hybrid device to capture the entire terrestrial solar spectrum does not necessarily lead to higher overall conversion efficiency.

    "abstract": "Photonic-based low-phase-noise microwave generation with real-time frequency tuning is crucial for a broad spectrum of subjects, including next-generation wireless communications, radar, metrology, and modern instrumentation. Here, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, narrow-bandwidth dual-wavelength microlasers are generated from nearly degenerate polygon modes in a high-Q active lithium niobate microdisk. The high-Q polygon modes formation with independently controllable resonant wavelengths and free spectral ranges is enabled by the weak perturbation of the whispering gallery microdisk resonators using a tapered fiber. The stable beating signal confirms the low phase-noise achieved in the tunable laser. Owing to the high spatial overlap factors between the two nearly degenerate lasing modes as well as that between the two lasing modes and the pump mode, gain competition between the two modes is suppressed, leading to stable dual-wavelength laser generation and in turn the low noise microwave source. The measured microwave signal shows a linewidth of ~6.87 kHz, a phase noise of ~-123 dBc/Hz, and an electro-optic tuning efficiency of -1.66 MHz/V. ",

Wide range offset locks are desirable, as they increase the span of usable frequencies in an experiment. Here, we experimentally realize a wide-range offset lock using a beat-note setup combined with electro-optic phase modulation. By using frequency down-conversion of the beat note and locking to sidebands generated by electro-optic modulation, we achieve an offset range of $\\pm$ 220.1 GHz with offset frequency fluctuations under 0.1 Hz, enabling an optical heterodyne offset lock with the largest known range of any such lock.

    "abstract": "Beam diagnostics are crucial for smooth accelerator operations. Many techniques rely on instrumentation in which the beam properties are significantly affected by the measurement. Novel approaches aim to use Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation (ChDR) for non-invasive diagnostics. Unlike regular Cherenkov Radiation, the charged particles do not have to move inside of the medium, but it is sufficient for them to move in its vicinity as long as they are faster than the speed of light in the medium. Changes to the beam properties due to ChDR measurements are consequently negligible. To examine ChDR emission under different conditions, we placed a fused silica radiator in the DESY II Test Beam. We observed a linear increase in ChDR intensity for electron and positron momenta between 1 GeV/c and 5 GeV/c. Additionally, we found that electrons produce significantly more ChDR than positrons for increasing particle momenta. The results suggest a need for further research into the ChDR generation by electrons and positrons and may find application in the design of future beam diagnostic devices. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging class of optical device capable of converting a set of input spatial light modes to a new target set of output modes. This operation represents a linear optical transformation - a much sought after capability in photonics. MPLCs have potential applications in both the classical and quantum optics domains, in fields ranging from optical communications, to optical computing and imaging. They consist of a series of diffractive optical elements (the 'planes'), typically separated by free-space. The phase delays imparted by each plane are determined by the process of inverse-design, most often using an adjoint algorithm known as the wavefront matching method (WMM), which optimises the correlation between the target and actual MPLC outputs. In this work we investigate high mode capacity MPLCs to create arbitrary spatial mode sorters and linear optical circuits. We focus on designs possessing low numbers of phase planes to render these MPLCs experimentally feasible. To best control light in this scenario, we develop a new inverse-design algorithm, based on gradient ascent with a specifically tailored objective function, and show how in the low-plane limit it converges to MPLC designs with substantially lower modal cross-talk and higher fidelity than achievable using the WMM. We experimentally demonstrate several prototype few-plane high-dimensional spatial mode sorters, operating on up to 55 modes, capable of sorting photons based on their Zernike mode, orbital angular momentum state, or an arbitrarily randomized spatial mode basis. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these proof-of-principle prototypes, and describe future improvements. Our work points to a bright future for high-dimensional MPLC-based technologies. ",

In order to accurately characterize the timing performance of this new sensors, several read-out boards, based on discrete active components, have been designed, assembled, and tested. The same electronics is also suitable for the characterization of similar pixel sensors whenever timing performance in the range and below 10-ps is a requirement. This paper describes the general characteristics needed by front-end electronics to exploit solid state sensors with high timing capabilities and in particular illustrates the performance of the developed electronics in the test and characterization of fast 3D silicon sensors.

These include a lack of explaining underlying quantum concepts of quantum 2.0 technology, framing quantum science and technology as spooky and enigmatic, framing quantum technology narrowly in terms of public good and having a strong focus on quantum computing. To date, no research has yet assessed whether these potential issues are actually present in popular communication about quantum science. In this content analysis, we have examined the presence of these potential issues in 501 TEDx talks with quantum science and technology content. Results show that while most experts (70%) explained at least one underlying quantum concept (superposition, entanglement or contextuality) of quantum 2.0 technology, only 28% of the non-experts did so. Secondly, the spooky/enigmatic frame was present in about a quarter of the talks. Thirdly, a narrow public good frame was found, predominantly by highlighting the benefits of quantum science and technology (found in over 6 times more talks than risks). Finally, the main focus was on quantum computing at the expense of other quantum technologies. In conclusion, the proposed frames are indeed found in TEDx talks, there is indeed a focus on quantum computing, but at least experts explain underlying quantum concepts often. ",

Important as it is, a scheme for direct measuring operator size on a quantum computer is still absent. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm for direct measuring the operator size and its distribution based on Bell measurement. The algorithm is verified with spin chains and meanwhile, the effects of Trotterization error and quantum noise are analyzed. It is revealed that saturation of operator size growth can be due to quantum chaos itself or be a consequence of quantum noises, which make a distinction between quantum integrable and chaotic systems difficulty on noisy quantum processors. Nevertheless, it is found that the error mitigation will effectively reduce the influence of noise, so as to restore the distinguishability of quantum chaotic systems. Our work provides a feasible protocol for investigating quantum chaos on noisy quantum computers by measuring operator size growth. ",

Here we show, by means of the sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo method, the complete ground state phase diagram of the fully packed quantum loop model on the square lattice. We find between the lattice nematic (LN) phase with strong dimer attraction and the staggered phase (SP) with strong dimer repulsion, there emerges a resonating plaquette (RP) phase with off-diagonal translational symmetry breaking. Such a novel phase is separated from the LN via a first order transition and from the SP by the famous Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our renormalization group analysis reveals the different flow directions towards different symmetry breaking phases, fully consistent with the order parameter histogram in Monte Carlo simulations. The realization of our phase diagram in Rydberg exmperiments is proposed. ",

    "title": "Criticality-Based Quantum Metrology in the Presence of Decoherence",
    "abstract": "Quantum metrology aims to use quantum resources to improve the precision of measurement. Quantum criticality has been presented as a novel and efficient resource. Generally, protocols of criticality-based quantum metrology often work without decoherence. In this paper, we address the issue whether the divergent feature of the inverted variance is indeed realizable in the presence of noise when approaching the QPT. Taking the quantum Rabi model (QRM) as an example, we obtain the analytical result for the inverted variance. We show that the inverted variance may be convergent in time due to the noise. When approaching the critical point, the maximum inverted variance demonstrates a power-law increase with the exponent -1.2, of which the absolute value is smaller than that for the noise-free case, i.e., 2. We also observe a power-law dependence of the maximum inverted variance on the relaxation rate and the temperature. Since the precision of the metrology is very sensitive to the noise, as a remedy, we propose performing the squeezing operation on the initial state to improve the precision under decoherence. In addition, we also investigate the criticality-based metrology under the influence of the two-photon relaxation. Contrary to the single-photon relaxation, the quantum dynamics of the inverted variance shows a completely-different behavior. It does not oscillate with the same frequency with respect to the re-scaled time for different dimensionless coupling strengths. Strikingly, although the maximum inverted variance still manifests a power-law dependence on the energy gap, the exponent is positive and depends on the dimensionless coupling strength. This observation implies that the criticality may not enhance but weaken the precision in the presence of two-photon relaxation. It can be well described by the non-linearity introduced by the two-photon relaxation. ",
