    "title": "Cross-calibration of atomic pressure sensors and deviation from quantum  diffractive collision universality for light particles",
    "abstract": "The total room-temperature, velocity-averaged cross section for atom-atom and atom-molecule collisions is well approximated by a universal function depending only on the magnitude of the leading order dispersion coefficient, $C_6$. This feature of the total cross section together with the universal function for the energy distribution transferred by glancing angle collisions ($P_{\\rm{QDU}6}$) can be used to empirically determine the total collision cross section and realize a self-calibrating, vacuum pressure standard. This was previously validated for Rb+N$_2$ and Rb+Rb collisions. However, the post-collision energy distribution is expected to deviate from $P_{\\rm{QDU}6}$ in the limit of small $C_6$ and small reduced mass. Here we observe this deviation experimentally by performing a direct cross-species loss rate comparison between Rb+H$_2$ and Li+H$_2$ and using the \\textit{ab initio} value of $\\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Li+H}_2}$. We find a velocity averaged total collision cross section ratio, $R = \\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Li+H}_2} : \\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Rb+H}_2} = 0.83(5)$. Based on an \\textit{ab initio} computation of $\\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Li+H}_2} = 3.13(6)\\times 10^{-15}$ m$^3$/s, we deduce $\\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Rb+H}_2} = 3.8(2) \\times 10^{-15}$ m$^3$/s, in agreement with a Rb+H$_2$ \\textit{ab initio} value of $\\langle \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}} v \\rangle_{\\mathrm{Rb+H_2}} = 3.57 \\times 10^{-15} \\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$.By contrast, fitting the Rb+H$_2$ loss rate as a function of trap depth to the universal function we find $\\langle \\sigma_{\\rm{tot}} \\, v \\rangle_{\\rm{Rb+H}_2} = 5.52(9) \\times 10^{-15}$ m$^3$/s. Finally, this work demonstrates how to perform a cross-calibration of sensor atoms to extend and enhance the cold atom based pressure sensor. ",

    "title": "Polarition localization and spectroscopic properties of disordered  quantum emitters in spatially-extended microcavities",
    "abstract": "Experiments have demonstrated that the strong light-matter coupling in polaritonic microcavities significantly enhance conductivity. The theoretical investigation is challenging, as one has to accurately describe both the continuum of light modes and energetically, spatially and orientational disorder of the quantum emitters. In this Letter, we exactly solve the continuum-mode disordered Tavis-Cummings model and predict the spectral properties and the structure of the eigenstates, i.e., the polaritons, and their localization length. Independent of the dimension, all polaritons are localized in space and decay exponentially with distance from the center. Yet, the localization length diverges rapidly as the energy moves away from the quantum emitter excitation energies, such that it by far exceeds the typical length of microcavities. This defines a ballistic and a localized transport regime. The localization length depends sensitively on the light-matter interaction strength and can increase by more than one order of magnitude when slightly increasing the interaction strength. Intriguingly, the localization length can exhibit a turnover as a function of disorder, which is in contrast to the monotonically decaying localization length for the celebrated Anderson localization. The analytical predictions are confirmed by numerically exact finite-size calculations and shed light on spectroscopic and transport measurements in cavities. ",

    "abstract": "As a key component for next-generation wireless communications (6G and beyond), terahertz (THz) electronic oscillators are being actively developed. Precise and dynamic phase control of ultrafast THz waveforms is essential for high-speed beam steering and high-capacity data transmission. However, measurement of such ultrafast dynamic process is beyond the scope of electronics due to the limited bandwidth of the electrical measuring instruments. Here we surpass this limit by applying photonic technology. Using a femtosecond laser, we generate offset-free THz pulses to phase-lock the electronic oscillators based on a resonant tunneling diode. This enables us to perform phase-resolved measurement of the emitted THz electric field waveform in time-domain with sub-cycle time resolution. Ultrafast dynamic response such as anti-phase locking behaviour is observed, which is distinct from in-phase stimulated emission observed in laser oscillators. We also show that the dynamics follows the universal synchronization theory for limit cycle oscillators. This provides a basic guideline for dynamic phase control of THz electronic oscillators, enabling many key performance indicators to be achieved in the new era of 6G and beyond. ",

    "title": "Comparing Instrument Spectral Sensitivity of Dissimilar Electromagnetic  Haloscopes to Axion Dark Matter and High Frequency Gravitational Waves",
    "abstract": "It is known that axion haloscopes that operate to search for dark matter axions via the 2-photon anomaly are also sensitive to gravitational waves (GWs) through the inverse Gertsenshtein effect. Recently this way of searching for high frequency GWs has gained momentum as it has been shown that the strain sensitivity of such detectors, h_g, are of the same order of sensitivity as the axion-photon theta angle, \\theta_a, which is related to the axion 2-photon coupling, g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}, by, \\theta_a = g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}a, where, a, is the axion scalar field. This means after calculating the sensitivity of a haloscope to an axion signal, we also have calculated the order of magnitude sensitivity to a GW signal of the same spectral and temporal form. However, it is unlikely that a GW and an axion signal will be of the same form since physically the way the signals are generated are completely different. For GW detection, the spectral strain sensitivity in units strain per square root Hz, and is the natural way to compare the sensitivity of GW detectors due to its independence on the GW signal. Likewise, one can define a spectral axion-photon theta angle sensitivity in units of theta angle per square root Hz for axion detectors, which is independent of the axion signal. In this work we introduce a systematic way to calculate the spectral sensitivity of an axion haloscope so instrument comparison may be achieved independent of signal assumptions and only depends on the axion to signal transduction sensitivity and noise in the instrument. Thus, the calculation of the spectral sensitivity not only allows the comparison of dissimilar axion detectors independent of signal, but also allows comparison of the GW sensitivity in terms of spectral strain sensitivity, allowing comparisons to standard GW detectors based on optical interferometers and resonant-mass technology.

Since 2019 and the start of the data taking, the SVD has demonstrated a reliable and highly efficient operation, even running in an environment with harsh beam backgrounds that are induced by the world's highest instantaneous luminosity. In order to provide the best quality track reconstruction with an efficient pattern recognition and track fit, and to correctly propagate the uncertainty on the hit's position to the track parameters, it is crucial to precisely estimate the resolution of the cluster position measurement.

Both the side walls of the enclosure are insulated(i.e. adiabatic boundary condition), while the bottom plate is at higher temperature and the top wall is at colder temperature. Effects of heating of the bottom wall and movement of the top lid have been investigated by conducting numerical simulations at different Richardson numbers by varying from low and moderate magnitudes within the limits of Boussinesq-approximation. Three standard cases has been compared, in the first case heating effects are not taken into account and only the flow due to shear action of the plate is studied. In the second case only the heating effects are taken into account and shear effects are neglected. In the third case effects of both heating and shear action is taken into consideration(i.e. mixed convection). Drag force on the moving plate is calculated in all the three cases and effect of temperature on the drag force is studied. For running the above simulation a code has been developed which is validated by comparing the results with Ghia et al for non-heating case. ",

Hence we construct from there a composition law between the sub-parts making the whole configuration space. This gives meaning to black hole self-similarity, entirely within a single description, as a phenomenon stemming from the well known self-similarity of the ordered partitions of $N$. Finally, we compare the above to the well-known results on the subleading (quantum) corrections, that necessarily require different (quantum) statistical weights for the various configurations. ",

Using the octonions as space-time coordinates, we construct a pre-spacetime, pre-quantum Lagrangian dynamics. We show that the symmetries of this non-commutative space unify the standard model of particle physics with $SU(2)_R$ chiral gravity. The algebra of the octonionic space yields spinor states which can be identified with three generations of quarks and leptons. The geometry of the space implies quantisation of electric charge, and leads to a theoretical derivation of the mysterious mass ratios of quarks and the charged leptons.

Traditional solution strategies necessitate an enormous, and frequently infeasible, number of forward model solves, as well as the computation of parametric derivatives. In order to enable efficient solutions, we extend DeepONets by employing a realNVP architecture which yields an invertible and differentiable map between the parametric input and the branch net output. This allows us to construct accurate approximations of the full posterior which can be readily adapted irrespective of the number of observations and the magnitude of the observation noise. As a result, no additional forward solves are required, nor is there any need for costly sampling procedures. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed methodology in the context of inverse problems based on a anti-derivative, a reaction-diffusion and a Darcy-flow equation. ",
