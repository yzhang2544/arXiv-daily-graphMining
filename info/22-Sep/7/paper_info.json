    "title": "Modeling frequency shifts of collective bubble resonances with the  boundary element method",
    "abstract": "Increasing the number of closely-packed air bubbles immersed in water changes the frequency of the Minnaert resonance. The collective interactions between bubbles in a small ensemble are primarily in the same phase, causing them to radiate an axially symmetric field that peaks at a frequency lower than the Minnaert resonance for a single bubble. Differently, large periodic arrays include bubbles that are further apart than half the wavelength so that collective resonances have bubbles oscillating in opposite phases, ultimately creating a fundamental resonance at a frequency higher than the single-bubble Minnaert resonance. This paper explains the transition in resonance behavior through a modal analysis of a mass-spring system and a boundary element method. We significantly reduce the computational complexity of the full-wave solver to a linear dependence on the number of bubbles in a rectangular array. The simulated acoustic fields confirm the initial downshift in resonance frequency and the strong influence of collective resonances when the array has hundreds of bubbles covering more than half the wavelength. These results are essential in understanding the low-frequency resonance characteristics of bubble ensembles, which have important applications in diverse fields such as underwater acoustics, quantum physics, and metamaterial design.

Inversion symmetry in our system is broken due to detuning introduced into constituent sublattices of the honeycomb structure. We show that nonlinear valley Hall edge states with sufficiently high amplitude bifurcating from the linear valley Hall edge state supported by the domain wall, can split into sets of bright spots due to development of the modulational instability, and that such an instability is a precursor for the formation of topological bright valley Hall edge solitons localized due to nonlinear self-action and travelling along the domain wall over large distances. Topological protection of the valley Hall edge solitons is demonstrated by modeling their passage through sharp corners of the $\\Omega$-shaped domain wall. ",

    "abstract": "Amorphous mixed titania-tantala coatings are key components of Bragg reflectors in the gravitational wave detectors (GWDs). Attaining the lowest possible values of optical absorption and mechanical losses in the coatings is of paramount importance for GWDs, and this requires a complex optimization of the coating deposition and post-deposition annealing. We present here a systematic investigation of the optical properties and internal friction of amorphous mixed titania-tantala coatings grown by ion beam sputtering. We consider coatings with six different cation mixing ratios and we study them both in the as-deposited and annealed state. By exploiting spectroscopic ellipsometry data and modelling, along with ancillary techniques, we retrieved the dielectric function of the coatings in a wide spectral range. When varying the mixing ratio and performing the annealing we find monotonic trends for most of the aforementioned properties. Remakably, the post-annealing Urbach energy displays a definite minimum for a mixing ratio around 20%, very close to the composition of the coatings showing the lowest optical absorption for GWDs applications. We suggest that the observed minimum in the Urbach energy depends not only on the mixing ratio, but also on the annealing parameters. On the other hand, the minimum coating loss angle was found to be weakly dependent on the considered measurement frequency and to lie within a rather broad range of Ti content, suggesting that the search for an absolute minimum following post-deposition annealing should be rather sought in the study of the best annealing parameters for each specific cation ratio considered. This work constitutes a reference for the optical properties of the amorphous mixed titania-tantala coatings, and highlights the relevance of the Urbach energy in the optimization process of materials for high-performing Bragg reflectors.

Gradient-based approaches to photonic inverse design often include thresholding of non-binary optimization arrays; when the thresholding is sufficiently sharp, binary designs are obtained. However, difficulty can arise due to vanishing gradients for sharp thresholds, which cause optimization to stall. Here, we present hypersphere optimization, a new method of carrying out binarized photonic optimization on a high dimensional manifold. We numerically show that, on the manifold, upstream gradients from the objective function can smoothly transition a design from one nearly-binary array to another with minimal pixel flips. Our method is an approximate gradient-based optimization method for binary arrays that can be applied to various photonic inverse design problems and beyond. ",

Here, we demonstrate the spatial mapping of the coupling strength between a local terahertz source on a spintronic emitter and far-field light mediated by a structured metallic environment. For a bow-tie geometry, experimental results are reproduced by a numerical model providing insights into the microscopic coupling mechanisms. The broad applicability of the technique is showcased by extracting the THz mode structure in split-ring resonator metasurfaces and linear arrays.

    "abstract": "Atom-based radio frequency electromagnetic field sensing using atomic Rydberg states is a promising technique that has recently attracted significant interest. Its unique advantages, such as extraordinary bandwidth, self-calibration and all-dielectric sensors, are a tangible improvement over antenna-based methods in applications such as test and measurement, and development of broad bandwidth receivers. Here, we demonstrate how an optical frequency comb can be used to acquire data in the Autler-Townes regime of Rydberg atom-based electrometry in a massively parallel fashion, eliminating the need for laser scanning. Two-photon electromagnetically induced transparency read-out and preparation of cesium is used for the demonstration. A flat, quasi-continuous optical comb is generated with the probe laser at 852 nm using an electro-optic modulator and arbitrary waveform generator. A single frequency coupling laser at 509 nm is tuned to the Rydberg launch state. An enhanced transmission signal is obtained using self-heterodyne spectroscopy. The comb signal is beat against a local oscillator derived from the single frequency probe laser on a fast photodiode. The transmission of each probe laser comb tooth is observed. We resolve electromagnetically induced transparency peaks with linewidths below 5 MHz, with and without laser locking. Radio frequency electromagnetic fields as low as 66 $\\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$ are detected with sensitivities of 2.3 $\\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The method offers a significant advantage for reading-out electromagnetically induced transparency and Autler-Townes splitting as neither laser needs to be scanned and slow frequency drifts can be tolerated in some applications. The method enables the detection of the amplitude of a pulsed radio frequency electromagnetic field when the incoming pulse Autler-Townes splits the electromagnetically induced transparency peak. ",

This effect is usually considered to be a drawback as it causes frequency chirping of the pulses produced via direct current modulation. Here, we show that at high values of thermal resistance of a laser diode, the shift in the wavelength is mainly governed by a change in the temperature of the active layer and it can significantly exceed (in absolute value) the shift related to a refractive index change. We propose to benefit from the ability to tune wavelength by the pump current variation and use the same laser to generate qubits and synchronization optical pulses for quantum key distribution at different wavelengths. To demonstrate the proposed method of synchronization, we perform numerical simulations as well as proof-of-principle experiments. ",

We develop a framework based on linear response for quantum electrodynamical systems to study how light-matter coupling affects the optical response. We begin by applying this framework to find the optical response of a two-level emitter coupled to a single cavity mode, which could be seen as a \"meta-atom\" of a metamaterial built from repeated units of this system. We find optical behaviors ranging from that of a simple two-level system (Lorentz-oscillator) to effectively transparent, as the coupling goes from the weak to deep strong coupling regimes. We explore a one-dimensional chain of these meta-atoms, demonstrating the tunability of its optical behavior. Our scheme may ultimately provide a framework for designing new metamaterials with low-loss, highly-confined modes, as well as tunable (single-photon) nonlinearities. ",

We designed and carried out a low-budget experiment in our undergraduate physics lab to measure the magnetic field a close distance from the surface of a pure Vanadium disk sample isothermally with a Hall sensor across a range of different temperatures and external magnetic fields. We then used these measurements to compute the superconducting phase diagram of Vanadium. After completing measurements at eight temperatures ranging from 2.6K to 5K and magnetic fields ranging from -0.2T to 0.2T, we were able to detect the Meissner phase (clearly), and a vortex phase (less clearly). Using the graphs of the hall bar magnetic field versus external magnetic field, we were able to derive a rough estimate for the upper critical field and the lower critical field of Vanadium at the eight temperatures wherein we conducted measurements. The results are in general accord with the phase diagram of Vanadium found in the literature, except that the critical temperature appears to be less than 5.43K and 5.13K (about 4.8K). Further, we observed critical fields lower than those found in the literature. We hypothesize this is due mostly to impurities in our Vanadium sample (purchased through Amazon.com), which would reduce the measured critical temperature below that of pure Vanadium, consistent with our results.

Coherent states ubiquitous in classical and quantum communications, squeezed states used in quantum sensing, and even highly-entangled cluster states studied in the context of quantum computing can be produced deterministically, but they obey quasi-classical optical field statistics described by Gaussian, positive Wigner functions. Fully harnessing the potential of many quantum engineering protocols requires using non-Gaussian Wigner-negative states, so far produced using intrinsically probabilistic methods. Here we describe the first fully deterministic preparation of non-Gaussian Wigner-negative free-propagating states of light, obtained by mapping the internal state of an intracavity Rydberg superatom onto an optical qubit encoded as a superposition of 0 and 1 photons. This approach allows us to reach a 60% photon generation efficiency in a well-controlled spatio-temporal mode, while maintaining a strong photon antibunching. By changing the qubit rotation angle, we observe an evolution from quadrature squeezing to Wigner negativity. Our experiment sets this new technique as a viable method to deterministically generate non-Gaussian photonic resources, lifting several major roadblocks in optical quantum engineering. ",

The time needed for complete curing is found to increase as the polymerization volume is decreased below a characteristic threshold that depends on the specific reaction pathway. This behavior is rationalized by modelling the process through a size-dependent polymerization rate. Our study highlights that the formation of photopolymerized networks might be affected by the involved volumes regardless of the specific curing mechanisms, which could play a crucial role in optimizing photocuring-based additive manufacturing.

    "abstract": "We report the simultaneous softening and compaction of a confined dense granular pack in acoustic resonance experiments. Elastic softening is manifested by a reduction of the shear-wave speed, as the wave amplitude increases beyond some threshold. No macroscopic rearrangement of grains or dilatancy is observed; instead, elastic softening is accompanied by a tiny amount of compaction on the scale of grain asperities. We explain these apparent contradictory observations using a theoretical model, based on shear transformation zones (STZs), of soft spots and slipping contacts. It predicts a linear shear stress-strain response with negligible macro-plastic deformation due to the small-amplitude acoustic oscillation. However, these waves reduce the interparticle friction and contact stiffness through the acoustic lubrication of grain contacts, resulting in an increase in the structural disorder or compactivity and softening of dynamic modulus. The compaction associated with this microscopic friction decrease is consistent with the prediction by an Ising-like correlation between STZs in the subyield regime. ",

    "abstract": "Experiments are beginning to probe the interaction of quantum particles with gravitational fields beyond the uniform-field regime. In standard quantum mechanics, the gravitational field in such experiments is written as a superposition state. We empirically demonstrate that alternative theories of gravity can avoid gravitational superposition states only by decoupling the gravitational field energy from the quantum particle's time evolution. Furthermore, such theories must specify a preferred quantum reference frame in which the equations of motion are valid. To the extent that these properties are theoretically implausible, recent experiments provide indirect evidence that gravity has quantum features. Proposed experiments with superposed gravitational sources would provide even stronger evidence that gravity is nonclassical. ",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a decentralized system that allows transaction transmission and storage according to the roles of the Consensus algorithm and Smart contracts. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) consolidate the best characteristics of blockchain technology to deliver unique and bona fide tokens, each with distinctive attributes with non-fungible resources. Unfortunately, current classical NFTs are suffering from high costs regarding the consumed power of mining and lack of security. Therefore, this paper presents a new protocol for preparing quantum non-fungible tokens where a quantum state representing NFT is mounted on a blockchain instead of physically giving it to the owner. The proposed scheme is simulated and analyzed against various attacks and proves its ability to secure against them. Furthermore, the presented protocol provides reliable and cheaper NFTs than the classical one. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic nanojets (PNJs) have promising applications as optical probes in super-resolution optical microscopy, Raman microscopy, as well as fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we consider optimal design of PNJs using a heterogeneous lens refractive index with a fixed lens geometry and uniform plane wave illumination. In particular, we consider the presence of manufacturing error of heterogeneous lens, and propose a computational framework of Optimization Under Uncertainty (OUU) for robust optimal design of PNJ. We formulate a risk-averse stochastic optimization problem with the objective to minimize both the mean and the variance of a target function, which is constrained by the Helmholtz equation that governs the 2D transverse electric (2D TE) electromagnetic field in a neighborhood of the lens. The design variable is taken as a spatially-varying field variable, where we use a finite element method for its discretization, impose a total variation penalty to promote its sparsity, and employ an adjoint-based BFGS method to solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem. We demonstrate that our proposed OUU computational framework can achieve more robust optimal design than a deterministic optimization scheme to significantly mitigate the impact of manufacturing uncertainty.
