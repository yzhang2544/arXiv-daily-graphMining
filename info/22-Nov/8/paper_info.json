    "abstract": "The article contains a review and new results of some mathematical models relevant to the interpretation of quantum mechanics and emulating well-known quantum gauge theories, such as scalar electrodynamics (Klein-Gordon-Maxwell electrodynamics), spinor electrodynamics (Dirac-Maxwell electrodynamics), etc. In these models, evolution is typically described by modified Maxwell equations. In the case of scalar electrodynamics, the scalar complex wave function can be made real by a gauge transformation, the wave function can be algebraically eliminated from the equations of scalar electrodynamics, and the resulting modified Maxwell equations describe the independent evolution of the electromagnetic field. Similar results were obtained for spinor electrodynamics. Three out of four components of the Dirac spinor can be algebraically eliminated from the Dirac equation, and the remaining component can be made real by a gauge transformation. A similar result was obtained for the Dirac equation in the Yang-Mills field. As quantum gauge theories play a central role in modern physics, the approach of this article may be sufficiently general. One-particle wave functions can be modeled as plasma-like collections of a large number of particles and antiparticles. This seems to enable the simulation of quantum phase-space distribution functions, such as the Wigner distribution function, which are not necessarily non-negative. ",

    "abstract": "When a laser cavity supports the propagation of several ultrashort pulses, these pulses interact and can form compact bound states called soliton molecules. Soliton molecules are fascinating objects of nonlinear science, which present striking analogies with their matter molecules counterparts. The soliton pair, composed of two identical pulses, constitutes the chief soliton molecule of fundamental interest. The relative timing and phase between the two propagating pulses are the most salient internal degrees of freedom of the soliton molecule. These two internal degrees of freedom allow self-oscillating soliton molecules, which have indeed been repeatedly observed, whereas the lowdimensional chaotic dynamics of a soliton-pair molecule remains elusive, noting that it would require at least three degrees of freedom. We here report the observation of chaotic soliton-pair molecules within an ultrafast fiber laser, by means of a direct measurement of the relative optical pulse separation with sub-femtosecond precision in real time. Moreover, we demonstrate an all-optical control of the chaotic dynamics followed by the soliton molecule, by injecting a modulated optical signal that resynchronizes the internal periodic vibration of soliton molecule.

In this letter, its capability in microwave signal processing and prospective superiority is further demonstrated. Both the QMWP RF phase shifting and transversal filtering functionality, which are the fundamental building blocks of microwave signal processing, are realized. Besides the perfect immunity to the dispersion-induced frequency fading effect associated with the broadband carrier in classical microwave photonics, a native two-dimensional parallel microwave signal processor is provided.

By focusing a probe beam through a birefringent crystal before passing it through a polarizer, conoscopic interferences sculpt the spatial profile of the beam. The use of these patterns for acoustic wave detection revealed a higher detection sensitivity over existing techniques, such as reflectometry and beam distortion detection. However, the physical origin of the increased sensitivity is unknown. In this work, we present a model, describing the sensitivity behaviour of conoscopic interferometry with respect to the quarter-wave plate orientation and the diaphragm aperture, which is validated experimentally. Using the model, we optimize the detection sensitivity of conoscopic interferometry. We obtain a maximal sensitivity of detection when placing the diaphragm edge on the dark fringes of the conoscopic interference patterns. In the configurations studied in this work, conoscopic interferometry can be 8x more sensitive to acoustic waves than beam distortion detection. ",

    "abstract": "High harmonic generation (HHG) is an extreme nonlinear process where intense pulses of light drive matter to emit high harmonics of the driving frequency, reaching the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray spectral ranges. So far, the HHG process was always generated by intense laser pulses that are well described as a classical electromagnetic field. Advances in the generation of intense squeezed light motivate us to revisit the fundamentals of HHG and ask how the photon statistics of light may alter this process, and more generally alter the field of extreme nonlinear optics. The role of photon statistics in non-perturbative interactions of intense light with matter has remained unexplored in both experiments and theory. Here we show that the defining spectral characteristics of HHG, such as the plateau and cutoff, are sensitive to the photon statistics of the driving light. While coherent (classical) and Fock light states induce the established HHG cutoff law, thermal and squeezed states substantially surpass it, extending the cutoff compared to classical light of the same intensity. Hence, shaping the photon statistics of light enables producing far higher harmonics in HHG. We develop the theory of extreme nonlinear optics driven by squeezed light, and more generally by arbitrary quantum states of light. Our work introduces quantum optical concepts to strong-field physics as new degrees of freedom in the creation and control of HHG, and finally shows that experiments in this field are feasible. Looking forward, HHG driven by quantum light creates quantum states of XUV and X-rays, enabling applications of quantum optics in new spectral regimes. ",

We validate our formula by numerical simulations of quantum circuits for computing the polarizability of the water molecule, which is the second-order derivative of the energy with respect to the electric field. Moreover, the polarizabilities and refractive indices of thiophene and furan molecules are calculated as a testbed for possible industrial applications. We finally analyze the error-scaling of the estimated polarizabilities obtained by the proposed analytical derivative versus the numerical one obtained by the finite difference. Numerical calculations suggest that our analytical derivative may require fewer measurements (runs) on quantum computers than the numerical derivative to achieve the same fixed accuracy. ",

To evaluate the source performances an optical emission spectroscopy diagnostic was installed. The system includes a low resolution spectrometer in the spectral range of 300-850 nm and a high resolution (50 pm) one, to study respectively the atomic and the molecular emissions in the visible range. The spectroscopic data have been interpreted also by means of a collisional-radiative model developed at IPP Garching. Besides the diagnostic hardware and the data analysis methods, the paper presents the first plasma measurements across a transition to the full H mode, in a hydrogen discharge. The characteristic signatures of this transition in the plasma parameters are described, in particular the sudden increase of the light emitted from the plasma above a certain power threshold. ",

Several recent works in optics and acoustics tackle the challenge of imaging targets hidden from view (e.g. placed around a corner) by measuring time-of-flight (ToF) information using active SONAR/LiDAR techniques, effectively mapping the Green functions (impulse responses) from several sources to an array of detectors. Here, leveraging passive correlations-based imaging techniques, we study the possibility of acoustic NLoS target localization around a corner without the use of controlled active sources. We demonstrate localization and tracking of a human subject hidden around the corner in a reverberating room, using Green functions retrieved from correlations of broadband noise in multiple detectors. Our results demonstrate that the controlled active sources can be replaced by passive detectors as long as a sufficiently broadband noise is present in the scene. ",

    "abstract": "The present work investigates electron transport and heating mechanisms using an (r, z) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of a typical rf-driven axisymmetric magnetron discharge with a conducting target. It is shown that for the considered magnetic field topology the electron current flows through different channels in the (r, z) plane: a ``transverse'' one, which involves current flow through the electrons' magnetic confinement region (EMCR) above the racetrack, and two ''longitudinal'' ones. Electrons gain energy from the electric field along these channels following various mechanisms, which are rather distinct from those sustaining dc-powered magnetrons. The longitudinal power absorption involves mirror-effect heating (MEH), nonlinear electron resonance heating (NERH), magnetized bounce heating (MBH), and the heating by the ambipolar field at the sheath-presheath interface. The MEH and MBH represent two new mechanisms missing from the previous literature. The MEH is caused by a reversed electric field needed to overcome the mirror force generated in a nonuniform magnetic field to ensure sufficient flux of electrons to the powered electrode, and the MBH is related to a possibility for an electron to undergo multiple reflections from the expanding sheath in the longitudinal channels connected by the arc-like magnetic field. The electron heating in the transverse channel is caused mostly by the essentially collisionless Hall heating in the EMCR above the racetrack, generating a strong ExB azimuthal drift velocity. The latter mechanism results in an efficient electron energization, i.e., energy transfer from the electric field to electrons in the inelastic range. Since the main electron population energized by this mechanism remains confined within the discharge for a long time, its contribution to the ionization processes is dominant. ",

We discuss possibilities that they result from enlarged regular mode-comb spacings, from prime numbers-based solitary waves free of four-wave mixing or result from gain gratings.

This brief review aims to discuss some recent work on trapping plasmonic colloids with optical vortices and their lattices. The role of optical scattering and absorption has important implications on the underlying forces and torques, which is specifically enunciated. The effect of spin and orbital angular momentum in an optical vortex can lead to spin-orbit coupling dynamics, and these effects are highlighted with examples from the literature. In addition to assembly and dynamics, enhanced Brownian motion of plasmonic colloids under the influence of a vortex-lattice is discussed.

Based on the identical epitaxial layer scheme, all of the PMC, DPS, and DFB laser can be integrated monolithically using only a single step of metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy and two steps of III V material dry etching. For the DFB-PMC device, a high TE to TM polarization conversion efficiency 98% over a wide range of DFB injection currents is reported at 1555 nm wavelength. For the DFB-PMC-DPS device, a 60 degree rotation of the Stokes vector was obtained on the Poincar\\'e sphere with a range of bias voltage from 0 V to -4.0 V at IDFB is 170 mA. ",

    "abstract": "Collinear laser spectroscopy of fast atomic beams has been established as one of the main tools to perform precision experiments with atoms containing short-lived nuclei. Although highly sensitive, the spectral resolution of these techniques is typically limited to several MHz. Here, we study the use of transient interference phenomena to potentially improve the experimental resolution. Previous attempts to implement Ramsey-type measurements with fast beams were limited by the lack of understanding of the observed line shapes. By using a simple model, we provide a satisfactory description of the previously observed line shapes, and propose alternative experimental schemes to improve the resolution in fast ion-beam experiments.

    "abstract": "The intense terahertz (THz) pulses facilitate the observation of various nonlinear optical effects and manipulation of material properties. In this work, we report a convenient approach that can produce strong broadband terahertz pulses with center frequency tunable between 2-4 THz. The coherent THz light source with pulse energy of 1.2 microjoule can be generated from a low-cost crystalline quartz pumped by an ultrashort tilted wave-front pulse. Thanks to the wide transparent spectral window and high damage threshold, our theoretical analysis and experiment show that the optical rectification in quartz is as efficient as that in LiNbO3, but covers much broader spectral range. This work not only provides the light source that is urgently needed for nonlinear THz spectroscopy beyond 1 THz, but offers an alternative route in the selection of nonlinear optical crystals for optical frequency conversion.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new technique named Latent CATHODE (LaCATHODE) for performing \"enhanced bump hunts\", a type of resonant anomaly search that combines conventional one-dimensional bump hunts with a model-agnostic anomaly score in an auxiliary feature space where potential signals could also be localized. The main advantage of LaCATHODE over existing methods is that it provides an anomaly score that is well behaved when evaluating it beyond the signal region, which is essential to prevent the sculpting of background distributions in the bump hunt. LaCATHODE accomplishes this by constructing the anomaly score directly in the latent space learned by a conditional normalizing flow trained on sideband regions. We demonstrate the superior stability and comparable performance of LaCATHODE for enhanced bump hunting in an illustrative toy example as well as on the LHC Olympics R&D dataset. ",

Often the exponent under consideration has to be split into more than two operators $H=\\sum_k A_k$, for instance as local gates on quantum computers. We demonstrate how highly optimised schemes originally derived for exactly two operators $A_{1,2}$ can be applied to such generic Suzuki-Trotter decompositions, providing a formal proof of correctness as well as numerical evidence of efficiency. A comprehensive review of existing symmetric decomposition schemes up to order $n\\le4$ is presented and complemented by a number of novel schemes, including both real and complex coefficients. We derive the theoretically most efficient unitary and non-unitary 4th order decompositions. The list is augmented by several exceptionally efficient schemes of higher order $n\\le8$. Furthermore we show how Taylor expansions can be used on classical devices to reach machine precision at a computational effort at which state of the art Trotterization schemes do not surpass a relative precision of~$10^{-4}$. Finally, a short and easily understandable summary explains how to choose the optimal decomposition in any given scenario. ",

It is revealed that the position-ultra-sensitive giant Lamb shift with three or more orders of magnitude larger than that in the free space, can be induced by higher-order plasmonic dark modes of a metal nanoparticle. More importantly, this giant Lamb shift can be ultra-sensitively observed from the optical scattering spectrum of the nanoparticle via scanning an emitter by a sub-nanometer step, and the orientation of the Lamb shift image can be utilized to identify the dipole polarization of the emitter. They enable the optical spectrum microscope technology with angstrom precision and polarization identification, which will bring about broad applications in many fields, such as physics, chemistry, medicine, life science and materials science.

    "abstract": "The theory of the beam splitter (BS) in quantum optics is well developed and based on fairly simple mathematical and physical foundations. This theory has been developed for any type of BS and is based on the constancy of the reflection coefficients $R$ (or the transmission coefficient, where $R+T=1$) and the phase shift $\\phi$. It has recently been shown that the constancy of these coefficients cannot always be satisfied for a waveguide BS, where $R$ and $\\phi$ depend in a special way on photon frequencies. Based on this, this review systematizes the concept of BS in quantum optics into ``Conventional'' and frequency-dependent BS, and also presents the theory of such BS. It is shown that the quantum entanglement, photon statistics at the output ports, and the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect for such BS can be very different. Taking into account the fact that the waveguide BS is currently acquiring an important role in quantum technologies due to the possibility of its miniaturization, this review will be useful not only for theoreticians, but also for experimenters.
