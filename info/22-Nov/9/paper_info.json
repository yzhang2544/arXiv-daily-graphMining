    "abstract": "The effect of terahertz (THz) pulse generation has revolutionized broadband coherent spectroscopy and imaging at THz frequencies. However, THz pulses typically lack spatial structure, whereas structured beams are becoming essential for advanced spectroscopy applications. Non-linear optical metasurfaces with nanoscale THz emitters can provide a solution by defining the beam structure at the generation stage. We develop a non-linear InAs metasurface consisting of nanoscale optical resonators for simultaneous generation and structuring of THz beams. We find that THz pulse generation in the resonators is governed by optical rectification. It is more efficient than in ZnTe crystals, and it allows us to control the pulse polarity and amplitude, offering a platform for realizing binary-phase THz metasurfaces. To illustrate this capability, we demonstrate an InAs metalens, which simultaneously generates and focuses THz pulses. The control of spatiotemporal structure using nanoscale emitters opens doors for THz beam engineering and advanced spectroscopy and imaging applications. ",

    "abstract": "Neutral atoms trapped in the evanescent optical potentials of nanotapered optical fibers are a promising platform for developing quantum technologies and exploring fundamental science, such as quantum networks and quantum electrodynamics. Building on the successful advancements with trapped alkali atoms, here we demonstrate a state-insensitive optical dipole trap for strontium-88, an alkaline-earth atom, using the evanescent fields of a nanotapered optical fiber. Leveraging the low laser-cooling temperatures of $\\sim\\!\\!1~\\mu$K readily achievable with strontium, we demonstrate trapping in record low trap depths corresponding to $\\sim\\!\\!3~\\mu$K. Further, employing a double magic wavelength trapping scheme, we realize state-insensitive trapping on the kilohertz-wide $5s^{2}\\;^{1}\\!S_{0}-5s5p\\;^{3}\\!P_{1,|m|=1}$ cooling transition, which we verify by performing near-surface high-resolution spectroscopy of the atomic transition. This allows us to experimentally find and verify the state insensitivity of the trap nearby a theoretically predicted magic wavelength of 435.827(25) nm. Given the non-magnetic ground state and low collisional scattering length of strontium-88, this work also lays the foundation for developing versatile and robust matter-wave atomtronic circuits over nanophotonic waveguides.

    "abstract": "The multimode waveguide bends (MWBs) with very compact sizes are the key building blocks in the applications of different mode-division multiplexing (MDM) systems. To further increase the transmission capacity, the silicon multimode waveguide bends for dual polarizations are of particular interest considering the very distinct mode behaviors under different polarizations in the silicon waveguides. Seldom silicon MWBs suitable for both polarizations have been studied. In this paper we analyze several dual-polarization-MWBs based on different bending curve functions. These special curve-based silicon MWBs have the advantages of easy fabrication and low loss compared with other structures based on the subwavelength structures such as gratings. A comparison is made between the free-form curve, Bezier curve, and Euler curve, which are used in the bending region instead of a conventional arc. The transmission spectra of the first three TE and TM modes in the silicon multimode waveguide with a core thickness of 340 nm are investigated. The simulation results indicate that in the premise of the same effective radius which is only 10 in this paper, the 6-mode MWB based on the free-form curve has the optimal performances, including an extremely low loss below 0.052dB and low crosstalk below -25.97dB for all six modes in the wide band of 1500-1600 nm. The MWBs based on the Bezier and Euler curve have degraded performances in terms of the loss and crosstalk. The results of this paper provide an efficient design method of the polarization insensitive silicon MWBs, which may leverage the researches for establishing complicated optical transmission systems incorporating both the MDM and polarization-division multiplexing (PDM) technology.

This method, which we refer to as the spin mapping non-adiabatic RPMD (SM-NRPMD), is based on the spin-mapping formalism for the electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs) and ring polymer path-integral description for the nuclear DOFs. Using the Stratonovich-Weyl transform for the electronic DOFs, and the Wigner transform for the nuclear DOFs, we derived an exact expression of the Kubo-transformed time-correlation function (TCF). We further derive the spin mapping non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics using the Matsubara approximation that removes the high frequency nuclear normal modes in the TCF and derive the SM-NRPMD approach from the non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics by discarding the imaginary part of the Liouvillian. The SM-NRPMD method has numerical advantages compared to the original NRPMD method based on the MMST mapping formalism, due to a more natural mapping using the SU(N) Lie Group that preserves the symmetry of the original system. We numerically compute the Kubo-transformed position auto-correlation function and electronic population correlation function for three-state model systems. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the SM-NRPMD method, which outperforms the original MMST-based NRPMD. We envision that the SM-NRPMD method will be a powerful approach to simulate electronic non-adiabatic dynamics and nuclear quantum effects accurately. ",

Thermodynamics helps to establish the most favorable nonpolar surface as well as the water-deficient and water-rich phases under different ambient conditions, which we refer to as \"dehydrated\" and \"rehydrated\" phases, respectively. We compute the low-frequency dielectric response and the optical refractive indices of hydrogen niobate in different phases. The dielectric constant is greatly enhanced compared to lithium niobate. At shorter wavelengths, the refractive indices vary between each phase and have a sharp contrast to lithium niobate. Our study characterizes the structures and thermal instabilities of this compound and reveals its excellent dielectric and optical properties, which can be important in the future application in waveguides.

We show that dominant recombination through neutral exciton states can be achieved by careful control of the doping profile near an epitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dot placed in a columnar microcavity with distributed Bragg reflectors. The Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments carried out in the fabricated device demonstrate the degree of indistinguishability of 91% of successively emitted single photons within 242 ns at an efficiency of 10% inside a single-mode optical fiber. The achieved brightness made it possible to implement spatio-temporal demultiplexing of photons in six independent spatial modes with an in-fiber generation frequency of more than 0.1 Hz. ",

    "abstract": "As part of the Portuguese Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) program, a tracking radar and a double Wide Field of View Telescope system (4.3{\\deg} x 2.3{\\deg}) are being installed at the Pampilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO) in the centre of continental Portugal, complementing an already installed deployable optical sensor for MEO and GEO surveillance. The tracking radar will track space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) up to 1000 km and at the same time the telescope will also have LEO tracking capabilities. This article intends to discuss possible ways to take advantage of having these two sensors at the same location. Using both types of sensors takes advantage of the radar measurements which give precise radial velocity and distance to the objects, while the telescope gives better sky coordinates measurements. With the installation of radar and optical sensors, PASO can extend observation time of space debris and correlate information from optical and radar provenances in real time. During twilight periods both sensors can be used simultaneously to rapidly compute new TLEs for LEO objects, eliminating the time delays involved in data exchange between sites in a large SST network. This concept will not replace the need for a SST network with sensors in multiple locations around the globe, but will provide a more complete set of measurements from a given object passage, and therefore increase the added value for initial orbit determination, or monitoring of reentry campaigns of a given location. PASO will contribute to the development of new solutions to better characterize the objects improving the overall SST capabilities and constitute a perfect site for the development and testing of new radar and optical data fusion algorithms and techniques for space debris monitoring.
