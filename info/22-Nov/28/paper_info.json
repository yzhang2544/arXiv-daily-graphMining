Axial variations of flow and thermal parameters increase the cost of numerical simulations and restrict the application of analytical solutions. This work aims to find approximate analytical solutions for the acoustic field in annular ducts with linear gradients of axially non-uniform cross-sectional area and mean temperature. These solutions can be applied in low-order acoustic network models and enhance the ability of analytical methods to solve thermoacoustic instability problems in real annular chambers. A modified WKB method is used to solve the wave equation for the acoustic field, and an analytical solution with a wide range of applications is derived. The derivation of the equations requires assumptions such as low Mach number, high frequency and small non-uniformity. Cases with arbitrary distributions of cross-sectional surface area and mean temperature can be solved by the piecewise method as long as the assumptions are satisfied along the entire chamber. ",

In recent years, deep neural networks like the FermiNet and PauliNet have been used to significantly improve the accuracy of these first-principle calculations, but they lack an attention-like mechanism for gating interactions between electrons. Here we show that the Psiformer can be used as a drop-in replacement for these other neural networks, often dramatically improving the accuracy of the calculations. On larger molecules especially, the ground state energy can be improved by dozens of kcal/mol, a qualitative leap over previous methods. This demonstrates that self-attention networks can learn complex quantum mechanical correlations between electrons, and are a promising route to reaching unprecedented accuracy in chemical calculations on larger systems.

Resistive Silicon Detectors (RSD, also known as AC-LGAD), exploiting the signals seen on the electrodes surrounding the impact point, achieve excellent space and time resolutions even with very large pixels.

The paper first introduces the parametrization of the errors in the determination of the position and time coordinates in RSD, then outlines the reconstruction method, and finally presents the results. Three different pixel sizes are used in the analysis: 200 x 340, 450 x 450, and 1300 x 1300 microns^2. At gain = 30, the 450 x 450 microns^2 pixel achieves a time jitter of 20 ps and a spatial resolution of 15 microns concurrently, while the 1300 x 1300 microns^2 pixel achieves 30 ps and 30 micron, respectively.

A traditional single focusing transmitarray can achieve a good focus when the source is on-axis but moving the source off-axis produces a significant aberration. This paper presents a novel approach to reducing coma in off-axis scanning in the THz region. Here, a dual transmitarray solution is proposed, in which a transmitarray with an optimized phase profile is placed behind a regular phase profile transmitarray. A linearly polarized, dual-transmitarray antenna was fabricated for validation, and the focusing performances were experimentally characterized. The measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical ones. The generated spot of the dual-transmitarray antenna remains focused on an angle up to 50deg, with a -3 dB spot size of less than 4 mm at 290 GHz. The measured near-field sidelobes are all below -10 dB within the whole scanning range. ",

    "abstract": "This study performs a linear analysis of a turbulent reacting methane-air jet flame, with the goal of predicting the response of the reacting flow to upstream acoustic actuation. Accounting for heat release fluctuations is a vital component when investigating thermoacoustic instabilities and flame noise in a linearized framework. Unlike previous studies this work develops and applies an active flame approach, meaning the heat release oscillations of the flame resulting from the acoustic fluctuations are taken into account. To yield an active flame approach in the linear framework, a combustion model needs to be linearized. It is demonstrated that linearizing Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) combustion models leads to closure problems, making their application in the linearized framework troublesome. Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) combustion models, however, prove to circumvent this problem, which makes them suitable candidates for this purpose. The RANS combustion models are linearized around the temporal mean flow of the turbulent jet flame, which is obtained by LES. An a priori analysis shows that a linearized RANS-Eddy Break Up (EBU) model is the best suited among all investigated combustion models for the investigated set-up and reproduces with high accuracy the fluctuations in reaction rate obtained in the LES. Furthermore, the linearized governing equations of the flow including the linearized EBU model for the reaction rate are solved for incoming acoustic perturbations. The response modes show that the reaction rate oscillations are caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex rings, which perturb the jet flame. The results are in good agreement with the LES simulations in terms of the mode shapes of both reaction rate and velocity fluctuations. ",

We consider the deuteron production via the nuclear transmutation reactions $p+C\\rightarrow d+X$ where protons are accelerated by Coulomb field, generated in the target plasma.

    "abstract": "Microrheology, the study of fluids on micron length-scales, promises to reveal insights into cellular biology, including mechanical biomarkers of disease and the interplay between biomechanics and cellular function. Here a minimally-invasive passive microrheology technique is applied to individual living cells by chemically binding a bead to the surface of a cell, and observing the mean squared displacement of the bead at timescales ranging from milliseconds to 100s of seconds. Measurements are repeated over the course of hours, and presented alongside novel analysis to quantify changes in the cells' low-frequency elastic modulus and the cell's dynamics over the time window from around 0.01s to 10s. An analogy to optical trapping allows verification of the invariant viscosity of HeLa S3 cells under control conditions and after cytoskeletal disruption. Stiffening of the cell is observed during cytoskeletal rearrangement in the control case, and cell softening when the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted by Latrunculin B. These data correlate with conventional understanding that integrin binding and recruitment triggers cytoskeletal rearrangement. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that cell stiffening has been measured during focal adhesion maturation, and the longest time over which such stiffening has been quantified by any means. ",

While Raman spectroscopy is a promising label-free technique for micro-organism detection, reaching detection limits similar to those obtained using culture-based methods, while keeping a high accuracy, remains challenging due to weak bacterial Raman signals. Taking advantage of the unique electromagnetic properties of metamaterials, we demonstrate bacterial identification in liquid using an array of Fano-resonant metamolecules that act as an enhanced Raman scattering (FERS) platform. The metamaterial is designed to exhibit a Fano resonance close to the protein amide group fingerprint regions. Under the off-resonance condition, Raman signatures of Escherichia coli were recorded at several locations on the metamaterial. We observe that the intensity of the amide characteristic peaks increases during the bacteria exponential phase while it decreases at their stationary phase. This study provides a new set of opportunities for developing ultrasensitive FERS platforms suitable for large-scale applications and will be particularly useful for diagnostics and environmental studies.

The method relies on integral equations and the Method of Moments to calculate the induced surface and volumetric current densities throughout the metasurface upon a given incident illumination. By avoiding homogenization of the dielectric layer and calculating directly the scattered fields through the Method of Moments, the near-field and far-field response of the metasurface can be accurately predicted and optimized. In particular, a design example of a modulated dielectric metasurface, fed by a single embedded line source, is presented for the realization of a Chebyshev array pattern with -20 dB sidelobe level. Moreover, an externally-fed dielectric metasurface performing beam splitting of a normally-incident plane wave is designed, 3-D printed and measured, showing two reflected beams at +-30 degrees, high suppression of specular reflections (> 14 dB) and satisfactory agreement with the simulated and desired radiation patterns. The proposed design method for beamforming with dielectric metasurfaces can find application in higher frequencies where the use of copper may be problematic due to higher ohmic losses and fabrication challenges.

We explore this transition using the second-order intensity correlation $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ of the emitted light, and find strong, unbounded bunching of the emission from systems governed by the Rabi Hamiltonian. Surprisingly, this effect is observed not only in the ultra-strong coupling regime, but also in the regime of coupling typically recognized as weak coupling, where the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian predicts the opposite, strongly antibunched emission. This suggests that the intensity correlations are a particularly sensitive probe of the divergence between the Jaynes-Cummings and Rabi Hamiltonians, and can serve as an indicator of the breakdown of the rotating wave approximation.

This paper demonstrates a novel hardware-software co-design approach to scale up the training of graph neural networks for molecular property prediction. We introduce an algorithm to coalesce the batches of molecular graphs into fixed size packs to eliminate redundant computation and memory associated with alternative padding techniques and improve throughput via minimizing communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our co-design approach by providing an implementation of a well-established molecular property prediction model on the Graphcore Intelligence Processing Units (IPU). We evaluate the training performance on multiple molecular graph databases with varying degrees of graph counts, sizes and sparsity.

Being the sensor about 1 cm$^2$, a suitable preamplification electronics has been investigated in this work, which can deal with long pulses induced by the large capacitance of the sensor.

The ASIC offers an interesting pole-zero cancellation (PZC) that allows dealing with long SiPM signals, the feature of active summation of up to 8 input channels into a single differential output and it can offer a solution for reducing power consumption compared to discrete solutions. Measurements and simulations of MUSIC coupled to two SiPMs developed by Hamamatsu are considered and the ASIC response is characterized.

By April 2022, ten clusters of the telescope were put into operation, with 2880 optical modules in total. One of the relevant tasks in this context is to study the possibilities of increasing the efficiency of the detector based on the experience of its operation and the results obtained at other neutrino telescopes in recent years. In this paper, a variant of optimizing the configuration of the telescope is considered, based on the installation of additional strings of optical modules between the clusters (external strings). An experimental version of the external string was installed in Lake Baikal in April 2022. This paper presents a first estimate of the impact of adding external strings on the neutrino detection efficiency, as well as the technical implementation of the detection and data acquisition systems of the external string and first results of its in-situ tests.
