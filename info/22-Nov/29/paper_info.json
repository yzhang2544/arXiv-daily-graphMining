    "title": "Ultra-Fast Semi-Empirical Quantum Chemistry for High-Throughput  Computational Campaigns with Sparrow",
    "abstract": "Semi-empirical quantum chemical approaches are known to compromise accuracy for feasibility of calculations on huge molecules. However, the need for ultrafast calculations in interactive quantum mechanical studies, high-throughput virtual screening, and for data-driven machine learning has shifted the emphasis towards calculation runtimes recently. This comes with new constraints for the software implementation as many fast calculations would suffer from a large overhead of manual setup and other procedures that are comparatively fast when studying a single molecular structure, but which become prohibitively slow for high-throughput demands. In this work, we discuss the effect of various well-established semi-empirical approximations on calculation speed and relate this to data transfer rates from the raw-data source computer to the results visualization front end. For the former, we consider desktop computers, local high performance computing, as well as remote cloud services in order to elucidate the effect on interactive calculations, for web and cloud interfaces in local applications, and in world-wide interactive virtual sessions. The models discussed in this work have been implemented into our open-source software SCINE Sparrow. ",

    "abstract": "Intense, quasi-monochromatic, polarized $\\gamma$-ray beams produced by Compton scattering of laser photons against relativistic electrons are used for fundamental studies and applications. Following a series of photoneutron cross section measurements in the Giant Dipole Resonance energy region performed at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility, we have developed the eliLaBr Monte Carlo simulation code for characterization of the scattered $\\gamma$-ray photon beams. The code is implemented using Geant4 and is available on the GitHub repository (https://github.com/dan-mihai-filipescu/eliLaBr). Here we report the validation of the eliLaBr code on NewSUBARU LCS $\\gamma$-ray beam flux and spectral distribution data and two applications performed with it for asymmetric transverse emittance profiles electron beams, characteristic for synchrotrons. The first application is based on a systematic investigation of transverse collimator offsets relative to the laser and electron beam axis. We show that the maximum energy of the LCS $\\gamma$-ray beam is altered by vertical collimator offsets, where the edge shifts towards lower energies with the increase in the offset. Secondly, using the eliLaBr code, we investigate the effect of the laser polarization plane orientation on the properties of the LCS $\\gamma$-ray beams produced with asymmetric emittance electron beams. We show that: 1. The use of vertically polarized lasers contributes to the preservation of the LCS $\\gamma$-ray beam maximum energy edge by increasing the precision in the vertical collimator alignment. 2. Under identical conditions for the electron and laser beams phase-space distributions, the energy spectrum of the scattered LCS $\\gamma$-ray beam changes with the laser beam polarization plane orientation: the use of vertically polarized laser beams slightly deteriorates the LCS $\\gamma$-ray beam energy resolution.

    "abstract": "Irradiation of solids with ultrashort pulses using laser sources in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region is a yet predominantly unexplored field that opens broad possibilities for efficient and precise surface texturing for a wide range of applications. In the present work, we investigate both experimentally and theoretically the impact of laser sources on the generation of surface modification related effects and on the subsequent surface patterning of metallic and semiconducting materials. Through a parametric study we correlate the mid-IR pulsed laser parameters with the onset of material damage and the formation of a variety of periodic surface structures at a laser wavelength of {\\lambda}L=3200 nm and a pulse duration of {\\tau}p=45 fs. Results for nickel and silicon indicate that the produced topographies comprise both high and low spatial frequency induced periodic structures, similar to those observed at lower wavelengths, while groove formation is absent. The investigation of the damage thresholds suggests the incorporation of nonlinear effects generated from three-photon-assisted excitation (for silicon) and the consideration of the role of the non-thermal excited electron population (for nickel) at very short pulse durations. The results demonstrate the potential of surface structuring with mid-IR pulses, which can constitute a systematic novel engineering approach with strong fields at long-wavelength spectral regions that can be used for advanced industrial laser applications.

We consider a particular type of mirror-symmetric PMs being optically excited simultaneously via two light channels (tapered fibers). Based on the numerical simulations, we show that the spectral composition of supermodes in such PM can be effectively manipulated by changing the phase detuning between the optical channels.

    "abstract": "In recent years, tremendous progress has been made on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors for applications as X-ray detectors. To shield the visible light in X-ray detection, a blocking filter of aluminum is commonly employed. We designed three types of aluminum coating layers, which are deposited directly on the surface of back-illuminated sCMOS sensors during fabrication. A commercial 2k * 2k sCMOS sensor is used to realize these designs. In this work, we report their performance by comparison with that of an uncoated sCMOS sensor. The optical transmissions at 660 nm and 850 nm are measured, and the results show that the optical transmission reaches a level of about 10-9 for the 200 nm aluminum layer and about 10-4 for the 100 nm aluminum layer. Light leakage is found around the four sides of the sensor. The readout noise, fixed-pattern noise and energy resolution of these Al-coated sCMOS sensors do not show significant changes. The dark currents of these Al-coated sCMOS sensors show a noticeable increase compared with that of the uncoated sCMOS sensor at room temperatures, while no significant difference is found when the sCMOS sensors are cooled down to about -15 degree. The aluminum coatings show no visible crack after the thermal cycle and aging tests. Based on these results, an aluminum coating of a larger area on larger sCMOS sensors is proposed for future work.

    "abstract": "From the point of view of the differential phase delay experienced by the two counterpropagating optical fields, the self-starting of the mode-locked fiber laser with a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) is theoretically studied. Although it is generally believed that NALM shows a saturable absorption effect on both continuous wave (CW) light and pulses, we find a counter-intuitive fact that cross-phase modulation (XPM) leads to opposite signs of differential nonlinear phase shifts (NPSs) in these two cases, resulting in inverse saturable absorption (ISA) during pulse formation process. The ISA is not helpful for the self-starting of laser mode-locking and can be alleviated by introducing a non-reciprocal phase shifter into the fiber loop. In addition, we analyze the influences of gain-fiber position, splitting ratio, and optical attenuator in the fiber loop, on the differential NPS and self-starting process. These results are helpful for optimizing the design of NALM and lowering the self-starting threshold of the high-repetition-rate mode-locked fiber laser. ",

This enables for instance the fabrication of novel highly efficient X-ray imaging sensors. In order to investigate the effects of the covalent bonding on the signal generated in such sensors, wafer-wafer bonded silicon-silicon P-N pad diodes have previously been produced. The behaviour of these test samples is being investigated with transient current technique (TCT) measurements. In this paper we present an overview of the TCT setup as well as a custom sandwich-type sample holder used for these measurements. A review of the results presented in a previous paper shows, that the bonded P-N structures show a highly asymmetric depletion behaviour under reverse bias. IR edge TCT measurements confirm that only the P-side of the samples is being depleted. Comparing the integral of the TCT signals with the expected values based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem reveals an excess of signal being collected. This excess seems to be linked to a long exponential tail which is observed in the time domain TCT signals. ",

This makes the electronic structure problem of electronic resonances comparable to that of electronic bound states, thus reducing the complexity of the problem. CAPs depend on two types of parameters: the coupling parameter $\\eta$ and a set of spatial parameters which define the onset of the CAP. It has been a common practice over the years to minimize the CAP perturbation on the physical electronic Hamiltonian by running an $\\eta-$trajectory, whereby one fixes the spatial parameters and varies $\\eta$. The optimal $\\eta$ is chosen according to the minimum log-velocity criterion. But the effectiveness of an $\\eta-$trajectory strongly depends on the values of the fixed spatial parameters. In this work, we propose a more general criterion, called the $\\xi-$criterion, which allows one to minimize any CAP parameter, including the CAP spatial parameters. Indeed, we show that fixing $\\eta$ and varying the spatial parameters according to a scheme (i.e., running a spatial trajectory) is a more efficient and reliable way of minimizing the CAP perturbations (which is assessed using the $\\xi-$criterion). We illustrate the method by determining the resonance energy and width of the temporary anion of dinitrogen, at the Hartree-Fock and EOM-EA-CCSD levels, using two different types of CAPs: the box- and the smooth Voronoi-CAPs.

We confirm the results of our models against the full range of experimental results for CQDs available from an extensive review of the literature. The models can be equally applied to CQDs with varied sizes and with different oxygen content in the basal planes of the constituent graphenic sheets. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed blue fluorescent emission of nitrogen-free CQDs can be associated with either small oxidised areas on the periphery of the graphenic sheets, or with sub-nanometre non-functionalised islands of sp2-hybridised carbon with high symmetry confined in the centres of oxidised graphene sheets. Larger and/or less symmetric non-functionalised regions in the centre of functionalised graphene sheet are found to be sources of green and even red fluorescent emission from nitrogen-free CQDs. We also demonstrate an approach to simplify the modelling of the discussed sp2-islands by substitution with equivalent strained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Additionally, we show that the bandgaps (and photoluminescence) of CQDs are not dependent on either out-of-plane corrugation of the graphene sheet or the spacing between sp2-islands. Advantageously, our proposed models show that there is no need to involve light-emitting polycyclic aromatic molecules (nanographenes) with arbitrary structures grafted to the particle periphery to explain the plethora of optical phenomena observed for CQDs across the full range of experimental works.
