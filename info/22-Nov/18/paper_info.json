    "abstract": "We report the development of a method for eliminating background-induced systematic shifts affecting precise measurements of saturation absorption signals. With this technique, we measured the absolute frequency of the $6s^2~^1\\text{S}_0 \\to 6s6p~^3\\text{P}_1$ transition in $^{201a}\\text{Hg}$ ($F=3/2\\to F'=5/2$) to be $1181541111051(83)$~kHz. The measurement was referenced with an optical frequency comb synchronized to the frequency of the local representation of the UTC. This specific atomic line is situated on the steep slope of the Doppler background at room temperature, which results in frequency systematic shift. We determined the dependence of this shift on the properties of both the spectral line and the background of the measured signal. ",

    "abstract": "The unique material property of silicon carbide (SiC) and the recent demonstration of low-loss SiC-on-insulator integrated photonics platform have attracted considerable research interests for chip-scale photonic and quantum applications. Here, we carry out a thorough investigation of the Kerr nonlinearity among 4H-SiC wafers from several major wafer manufacturers, and reveal for the first time that their Kerr nonlinear refractive index can be significantly different. By eliminating various measurement errors in the four-wave mixing experiment and improving the theoretical modeling for high-index-contrast waveguides, the best Kerr nonlinear refractive index of 4H-SiC wafers is estimated to be approximately four times of that of stoichiometric silicon nitride in the telecommunication band. In addition, experimental evidence is developed that the Kerr nonlinearity in 4H-SiC wafers can be stronger along the c-axis than that in the orthogonal direction, a feature that was never reported before.

Through varying the radiative and nonradiative rates of the excitons, we can dynamically control both the reflection amplitude and phase profiles, resulting in an excitonic phased array metasurface. Our experiments show reflected light steering to angles between -30{\\deg} to 30{\\deg} at three different resonant wavelengths corresponding to the A exciton, B exciton, and trion. This active van der Waals metasurface relies solely on the excitonic resonances of the monolayer MoSe2 material rather than geometric resonances of patterned nanostructures, suggesting the potential to harness the tunability of excitonic resonances for wavefront shaping in emerging photonic applications.

Here, we present metasurfaces composed of a non-close packed assembly of metallic nanoparticles deposited on a reflective substrate coated with a low-index spacer. This geometry, which combines plasmonic and Fabry-Perot resonances, offers uncommon iridescences, differing from those classically observed with natural nanostructures or thin-film interferences. We highlight a remarkable iridescence with only two distinct colors and theoretically investigate its origin with an intuitive and accurate model that unveils the rich physical mechanisms at play. The interpretation paves the way towards the design of easy-to-make and universal building blocks with a large resilience to fabrication imperfections, and great potential for innovative coatings and fine-art applications.

Although much of the focus has been on quantum concepts in non-lab courses, current work in QIST has a substantial experimental component. Many instructors of undergraduate lab courses want to provide their students the opportunity to work with quantum experiments. One common way this is done is through a sequence of quantum optics experiments often referred to as the ``single-photon experiments.'' These experiments demonstrate fundamental quantum phenomena with equipment common to research labs; however, they are resource intensive and cannot be afforded by all institutions. It is therefore imperative to know what unique affordances these experiments provide to students. As a starting point, we surveyed and interviewed instructors who use the single-photon experiments in undergraduate courses, asking how and why they use the experiments. We describe the most commonly used experiments in both quantum and beyond-first-year lab courses, the prevalence of tasks the students perform, and the learning goals, ranging from conceptual knowledge to lab skills to student affect. Finally, we present some strategies from these data demonstrating how instructors have addressed the common challenges of preparing students to work with conceptually and technically complex experiments and balancing the practice of technical skills with the completion of the experiments.

Here we report discrete propagation of magnetic states in interconnected Co nanowire networks driven by magnetic field and current, manifested in distinct magnetoresistance (MR) features. In these networks, when only a few interconnected NWs were measured, multiple MR kinks and local minima were observed, including a significant minimum at a positive field during the descending field sweep. Micromagnetic simulations showed that this unusual feature was due to domain wall (DW) pinning at the NW intersections, which was confirmed by off-axis electron holography imaging. In a complex network with many intersections, sequential switching of nanowire sections separated by interconnects was observed, along with stochastic characteristics. The pinning/depinning of the DWs can be further controlled by the driving current density. These results illustrate the promise of such interconnected networks as integrated multistate memristors. ",

Here, we have taken a first step towards a possible solution of this problem by exploiting modern machine learning (ML) methods to reduce the duration of MOT measurements from several tens of minutes down to one second. This has been achieved by focusing on the analysis of computer simulated trajectories of an optically trapped particle suspended in a set of Newtonian fluids having viscosity values spanning three orders of magnitude, i.e. from $10^{-3}$ to $1$ Pa$\\cdot$s. When the particle trajectory is analysed by means of conventional statistical mechanics principles, we explicate for the first time in literature the relationship between the required duration of MOT experiments ($T_m$) and the fluids relative viscosity ($\\eta_r$) to achieve an uncertainty as low as $1\\%$; i.e., $T_m\\cong 17\\eta_r^3$ minutes. This has led to further evidences explaining why conventional MOT measurements commonly underestimate the materials' viscoelastic properties, especially in the case of high viscous fluids or soft-solids such as gels and cells. Finally, we have developed a ML algorithm to determine the viscosity of Newtonian fluids that uses feature extraction on raw trajectories acquired at a kHz and for a duration of only one second, yet capable of returning viscosity values carrying an error as low as $\\sim0.3\\%$ at best; hence the opening of a doorway for MOT in living systems.

Presently, the modulation of microlasers is based on modulating the gain of the laser, which implies a trade-off between the output peak power and the modulation energy. Besides, the temporal width of the output pulse is restricted by the carrier relaxation time. These limitations can be overcome by modulating, instead, the loss of the laser by the scheme of cavity dumping, which is ideal for intense and ultrashort pulse extraction. However, the miniaturization of cavity-dumped lasers has been a long-standing challenge, and no microscopic cavity-dumped lasers were yet realized. Here we demonstrate an ultra-small cavity-dumped microscopic laser based on an optical Fano resonance, which generates optical pulses with peak power more than one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding conventional gain-modulated laser.

We present a numerical study of an interacting Bistritzer-MacDonald (IBM) model of TBG using a suite of methods in quantum chemistry, including Hartree-Fock, coupled cluster singles, doubles (CCSD), and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), as well as a quantum chemistry formulation of the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). Our treatment of TBG is agnostic to gauge choices, and hence we present a new gauge-invariant formulation to detect the spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting models. To benchmark our approach, we focus on a simplified spinless, valleyless IBM model. At integer filling ($\\nu=0$), all numerical methods agree in terms of energy and $C_{2z} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry breaking. Additionally, as part of our benchmarking, we explore the impact of different schemes for removing ``double-counting'' in the IBM model. Our results at integer filling suggest that cross-validation of different IBM models may be needed for future studies of the TBG system. After benchmarking our approach at integer filling, we perform the first systematic study of the IBM model near integer filling (for $|\\nu|< 0.2$). In this regime, we find that the ground state can be in a metallic and $C_{2z} \\mathcal{T}$ symmetry breaking phase. The ground state appears to have low entropy, and therefore can be relatively well approximated by a single Slater determinant. Furthermore, we observe many low entropy states with energies very close to the ground state energy in the near integer filling regime. ",

For each of the ten circuits demonstrated in this work, the toolkit of photonic devices enables the compact circuit to achieve low insertion loss and low crosstalk. By adopting the sophisticated inverse-design approach, the design structure, shape, and sizing of each individual device can be made more flexible to better suit the architecture of the greater circuit. For a compact architecture, we present a unified, parallel waveguide circuit framework into which the devices are designed to fit seamlessly, thus enabling low-complexity circuit design. ",

    "abstract": "Silicon is the ideal material for building electronic and photonic circuits at scale. Spin qubits and integrated photonic quantum technologies in silicon offer a promising path to scaling by leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing and integration capabilities. However, the lack of deterministic quantum light sources, two-photon gates, and spin-photon interfaces in silicon poses a major challenge to scalability. In this work, we show a new type of indistinguishable photon source in silicon photonics based on an artificial atom. We show that a G center in a silicon waveguide can generate high-purity telecom-band single photons. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy and time-delayed two-photon interference to demonstrate the indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a G center in a silicon waveguide. Our results show that artificial atoms in silicon photonics can source highly coherent single photons suitable for photonic quantum networks and processors. ",

    "title": "Design and testing of Kinetic Inductance Detector package for the  Terahertz Intensity Mapper",
    "abstract": "The Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) is designed to probe the star formation history in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies around the peak of cosmic star formation. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\\sim 250$ long-slit grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor). This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| < 3 uT. ",

We show that the ability for particles to attract and bind is a key source of complexity of an $N$-body quantum system, and \\textit{arrangement} is an emergent concept necessitated by the description of this complexity. For an $N$-body system made of particles of which some or all can attract and bind, the concept of arrangement is not only necessary for a full characterization of its quantum states and processes, but it also provides a basis for the understanding and the description of the structure of its energy spectrum. We also discuss and formulate multiparticle separability in an $N$-body system, the mathematical foundation that underlies the arrangement concept in an $N$-body theory. ",

    "abstract": "The Earth's ionosphere introduces systematic effects that limit the performance of a radio interferometer at low frequencies ($\\lesssim 1$\\,GHz). These effects become more pronounced for severe geomagnetic activities or observations involving longer baselines of the interferometer. The uGMRT, a pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), is located in between the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionisation Anomaly (EIA) and the magnetic equator. Hence, this telescope is more prone to severe ionospheric conditions and is a unique radio interferometer for studying the ionosphere. Here, we present 235\\,MHz observations with the GMRT, showing significant ionospheric activities over a solar minimum. In this work, we have characterised the ionospheric disturbances observed with the GMRT and compared them with ionospheric studies and observations with other telescopes like the VLA, MWA and LOFAR situated at different magnetic latitudes. We have estimated the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) gradient over the full GMRT array which shows an order of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Furthermore, this article uses the ionospheric characteristics estimated from the observations with uGMRT, VLA, LOFAR and MWA to forecast the effects on the low-frequency observations with the SKA1-MID and SKA1-LOW in future.
