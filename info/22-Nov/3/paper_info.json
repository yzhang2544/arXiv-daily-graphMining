    "title": "Photonic Dirac Waveguides",
    "abstract": "The Dirac equation is a paradigmatic model that describes a range of intriguing properties of relativistic spin-1/2 particles, from the existence of antiparticles to Klein tunneling. However, the Dirac-like equations have found application far beyond its original scope, and has been used to comprehend the properties of graphene and topological phases of matter. In the field of photonics, the opportunity to emulate Dirac physics has also enabled topological photonic insulators. In this paper, we demonstrate that judiciously engineered synthetic potentials in photonic Dirac systems can offer physical properties beyond both the elementary and quasi-particles, and topological realms. Specifically, we introduce a new class of optical Dirac waveguides, whose guided electromagnetic modes are endowed with pseudo-spin degree of freedom. Pseudo-spin coupled with the ability to engineer synthetic gauge potentials acting on it, enables control over the guided modes which is unattainable in conventional optical waveguides. In particular, we use a silicon nanophotonic metasurface that supports pseudo-spin degree of freedom as a testing platform to predict and experimentally confirm a spin-full nature of the Dirac waveguides. We also demonstrate that, for suitable trapping potentials, the guided modes exhibit spin-dependent field distributions, which gives rise to their distinct transport and radiative properties. Thereby, the Dirac waveguides manifest spin-dependent radiative lifetimes - the non-Hermitian spin-Hall effect - and open new avenues for spin-multiplexing, controlling characteristics of guided optical modes, and tuning light-matter interactions with photonic pseudo-spins.

    "abstract": "This research describes the use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates based on colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced by laser ablation of silver granules in pure water that are inexpensive, easy to make, and chemically stable. Here, the effects of the laser power, pulse repetition frequency, and ablation duration on the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of AgNPs solutions, which was centered at 404 nm, were used to determine the optimal parameters. The substrates were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, and it was discovered that they were chemically stable within the first eight days of storage at room temperature since the spectroscopic profiles remained constant. The main bands were centered at 196, 640, 824, 1060, and 1538 cm-1, and they were attributed to the vibrations of O=Ag2/Ag-N, C-S-C, C-H, C-CO, C-N, and C=O, respectively. Additionally, these substrates had no impact on the Raman spectrum profiles of samples of rat blood when mixed with them. In comparison to thick blood smears on a clean piece of aluminum foil, the Raman spectral profiles of blood samples mixed with colloidal AgNPs were 14.95 times more enhanced. The Raman peaks noted were attributed to C-C stretching of lipids (932 cm-1), C-N stretching (1064 cm-1), C-C stretching (1190 cm-1), CH2 wagging (1338 and 1410 cm-1), carbonyl stretch for proteins (1650 cm-1), and C-H band of proteins (2122 cm-1). The results on the utilization of inexpensive, simple-to-prepare Raman substrates have the possibility of making surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy available to laboratories with scarce resources in developing nations.

    "abstract": "The great flexibility of direct laser writing arises from the possibility to fabricate precise three-dimensional structures on very small scales as well as the broad range of applicable materials. However, there is still a vast number of promising materials which are currently inaccessible requiring the continuous development of novel photoresists. Here, a new bio-sourced resist is reported which relies on the monomeric unit of chitin, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, expanding the existing plant-based biopolymer resists by a bio-based monomer from the animal kingdom. In addition it is shown that combined use of two photoinitiators is advantageous over the use of a single one. In our approach, the first photoinitator is a good two-photon absorber at the applied wavelength, while the second photoinitiator exhibits poor two-photon absorbtion abilities, but is better suited for crosslinking of the monomer. The first photoinitiator absorbs the light acting as a sensitizer and transfers the energy to the second initiator, which subsequently forms a radical and initializes the polymerization. This sensitization effect enables a new route to utilize reactive photointiators with a small two-photon absorption cross-section for direct laser writing without changing their chemical structure.

The present theory is based on electron scattering calculations performed at several internuclear distances in the molecule.

The theory can be applied to molecular ions with or without electronic resonances at low energies. The approach is applied to compute the DR cross section in electron-CH$^+$ collisions. The computed cross section agrees generally well with recent state-resolved data from a cryogenic storage-ring experiment, which validates the approach. ",

As a cornerstone for the implementation of quantum sensors in space, the CARIOQA phase 0 aimed at defining the Quantum Pathfinder Mission's scenario and associated performance objectives. To comply with these objectives, the payload architecture has been designed to achieve long interrogation time and active rotation compensation on a BEC-based atom interferometer. A study of the satellite architecture, including all the subsystems, has been conducted. Several technical solutions for propulsion and attitude control have been investigated in order to guarantee optimal operating conditions (limitation of micro-vibrations, maximization of measurement time).

    "abstract": "The formation of optical frequency combs (OFCs) by the parametric modulation of optical microresonators is commonly described by lumped-parameter models. However, these models do not consider the actual spatial distribution of the parametric modulation (SDPM). Here, we show that the effect of the SDPM becomes of special importance for an elongated SNAP bottle microresonator (SBM) having shallow nanometre-scale effective radius variation along its axial length. The advantage of SBMs compared to microresonators with different shapes (e.g., spherical and toroidal) is that SBMs, remaining miniature, can have resonant spectrum with much smaller free spectral range and no dispersion. Therefore, SBMs can be used to generate OFCs with much lower repetition rates. We consider the resonant and adiabatic modulation of parabolic SBMs and show that it is possible to improve the flatness and increase the bandwidth of the generated OFC spectra by optimising the SDPM. We suggest that the determined optimal SDPM can be experimentally realized using piezoelectric, radiation pressure, and electro-optical excitation of an SBM. ",

For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and an optimal trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We demonstrate that a simple control mechanism for the clock leads to a monotonic increase in cycle time certainty with biasing voltage alleviating its degradation at large biasing voltages. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation. ",

Furthermore, it relies on relatively low technology quantum-photon sources and detection equipment, but provides picosecond timing precision even under high loss and high noise channel conditions representative of daytime space-Earth links.

In this paper, the performance of optical channel impulse response (OCIR)-based localization is studied using an artificial neural network (ANN) to map embedded features of the OCIR to the user equipment's location. Numerical results show that OCIR-based localization outperforms conventional RSS techniques by two orders of magnitude using only two photodetectors as anchor points.

These networks show the presence of emergent complexity and collective phenomena in analogy with biological neural networks characterized by self-organization, redundancy, non-linearity. Starting from this background, we propose and formalize a generalization of the perceptron model to describe a classification device based on a network of interacting units where the input weights are nonlinearly dependent. We show that this model, called \"receptron\", provides substantial advantages compared to the perceptron as, for example, the solution of non-linearly separable Boolean functions with a single device. The receptron model is used as a starting point for the implementation of an all-optical device that exploits the non-linearity of optical speckle fields produced by a solid scatterer. By encoding these speckle fields we generated a large variety of target Boolean functions without the need for time-consuming machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate that by properly setting the model parameters, different classes of functions with different multiplicity can be solved efficiently. The optical implementation of the receptron scheme opens the way for the fabrication of a completely new class of optical devices for neuromorphic data processing based on a very simple hardware. ",
