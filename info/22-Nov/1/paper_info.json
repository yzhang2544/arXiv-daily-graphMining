    "abstract": "Phonons offer the possibility to connect the microwave and optical domains while being efficiently transduced with electronic and optical signals, although they are notoriously difficult to control with limited solutions for their generation, manipulation, and detection. Here, we present a multimodal optomechanical platform, consisting of a mechanical-optical-mechanical resonator configuration. The mechanical modes, with frequencies at 265 MHz and 6.8 GHz, can be simultaneously excited into a phonon lasing regime as supported by a stability analysis of the system. Both the MHz and the GHz lasing modes modulate the optical field, leading to a frequency comb in the GHz. We characterize this platform experimentally, demonstrating previously unexplored dynamical regimes. These results suggest the possibility to control multiple mechanical degrees of freedom via a single optical mode, with implications in GHz phononic devices, phonon signal processing, and optomechanical comb sensing applications.

    "abstract": "It has been recently shown that the coherent component of light propagating in transversally disordered media exhibits an analogue spin Hall effect (SHE). In non-resonant materials, however, the SHE shows up at a scale much larger than the mean free path, making its observation challenging due to the exponential attenuation of the coherent mode. Here, we show that in disordered photonic arrays, the SHE on the contrary appears at a scale smaller than the mean free path if one operates in the close vicinity of the second, transverse-magnetic Mie resonance of the array. In combination with a weak measurement, this gives rise to a giant SHE visible in optically-thin arrays. Furthermore, we find that by additionally exploiting the coherent flash of light following the abrupt extinction of the incoming beam, one can achieve a time-dependent SHE, observable at large optical thickness as well.

    "abstract": "Micro-/nanocavities that combine high quality factor ($Q$) and small mode volume ($V$) have been used to enhance light-matter interactions for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Whispering gallery mode (WGM) geometries such as microdisks and microrings support high-$Q$ and are design- and fabrication-friendly, but $V$ is often limited to tens of cubic wavelengths to avoid WGM radiation. The stronger modal confinement provided by either one-dimensional or two-dimensional photonic crystal defect geometries can yield sub-cubic-wavelength $V$, yet the requirements on precise design and dimensional control are typically much more stringent to ensure high-$Q$. Given their complementary features, there has been sustained interest in geometries that combine the advantages of WGM and photonic crystal cavities. Recently, a `microgear' photonic crystal ring (MPhCR) has shown promise in enabling additional defect localization ($>$ 10$\\times$ reduction of $V$) of a WGM, while maintaining high-$Q$ ($\\approx10^6$) and other WGM characteristics in ease of coupling and design. However, the unit cell geometry used is unlike traditional PhC cavities, and etched surfaces may be too close to embedded quantum nodes (quantum dots, atomic defect spins, etc.) for cQED applications. Here, we report two novel PhCR designs with `rod' and `slit' unit cells, whose geometries are more traditional and suitable for solid-state cQED. Both rod and slit PhCRs have high-$Q$ ($>10^6$) with WGM coupling properties preserved. A further $\\approx$~10$\\times$ reduction of $V$ by defect localization is observed in rod PhCRs. Moreover, both fundamental and 2nd-order PhC modes co-exist in slit PhCRs with high $Q$s and good coupling. Our work showcases that high-$Q/V$ PhCRs are in general straightforward to design and fabricate and are a promising platform to explore for cQED. ",

    "abstract": "We report a structural reconstruction-induced high photoluminescence quantum yield of 25% in colloidal two-dimensional tin iodide nanosheets that are synthesized by a hot-injection method. The as-synthesized red-colored nanosheets of octylammonium tin iodide perovskites at room temperature transform to white hexagonal nanosheets upon washing or exposure to light. This structural change increases the bandgap from 2.0 eV to 3.0 eV, inducing a large Stokes shift and a broadband emission. Further, a long photoluminescence lifetime of about 1 microsecond is measured for the nanosheets. Such long-lived broad and intense photoluminescence with large Stokes shift is anticipated to originate from tin iodide clusters that are formed during the structural reconstruction. Stereoactive 5s2 lone pair of tin (II) ions perturbs the excited state geometry of the white hexagonal nanosheets and facilitates the formation of self-trapped excitons. Such broadband and intensely emitting metal halide nanosheets are promising for white light-emitting diodes. ",

It would therefore be highly advantageous if the relative phase could be amplified to enhance the measurement resolution. One well-known method for phase amplification involves the use of the multi-photon number and path entangled state known as the NOON state; however, a high-number NOON state is very difficult to prepare and is highly sensitive to optical losses. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate in principle a phase amplifier scheme with the assistance of a harmonic generation process. The relative phase difference between two polarization modes in a polarized interferometer is amplified coherently four times with cascaded second-harmonic generation processes. We demonstrate that these amplification processes can be recycled and therefore have the potential to realize much higher numbers of multiple amplification steps. The phase amplification method presented here shows considerable advantages over the method based on NOON states and will be highly promising for use in precision optical measurements. ",

After presenting what is involved in such dispute, we point to a dilemma for realists: either we don't have the available metaphysical tools to answer the deep realist's demands, and realism is not justified in this case, or such demands of metaphysical dressing are not mandatory for scientific realism, and deep versions of realism are not really required.

The reflectance of the structure can be manipulated by altering the phase of GST by employing optical stimuli. The paper shows details on the optical and opto-thermal modeling techniques of GST. Numerical investigation reveals that the metastructure exhibits a conspicuous changeover from $\\sim$ 99% absorption to very poor interaction with the operating light depending on the switching states of the GST, ending up with 85\\% modulation depth and only 0.58 dB insertion loss. Due to noticeable differences in optical responses, we can demonstrate a high extinction ratio of 28 dB and a commendable FOM of 49, so far the best modulation performance in this wavelength window. In addition, real-time tracking of the reflectance during phase transition manifests high-speed switching expending low energy per cycle, on the order of sub-nJ. Hence, given its overall performance, the device will be a paradigm for the optical modulators for upcoming 2 $\\mu$m communication technology. ",

In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to quantify error tolerance and scalability in a more general class of \"binary tree cascade'' programmable photonic networks that accept up to tens of thousands of discrete input modes $N$. To justify this scalability claim, we derive error tolerance and configuration time that scale with $\\log_2 N$ for balanced trees versus $N$ in unbalanced trees, despite the same number of total components. Specifically, we use second-order perturbation theory to compute phase sensitivity in each waveguide of balanced and unbalanced networks, and we compute the statistics of the sensitivity given random input vectors. We also evaluate such networks after they self-correct, or self-configure, themselves for errors in the circuit due to fabrication error and environmental drift. Our findings have important implications for scaling photonic circuits to much larger circuit sizes; this scaling is particularly critical for applications such as principal component analysis and fast Fourier transforms, which are important algorithms for machine learning and signal processing.

We find that acoustic liners can be regarded as porous surfaces with a wall-normal permeability and that the relevant length scale characterizing their added drag is the inverse of the wall-normal Forchheimer coefficient. Unlike other types of porous surfaces featuring Darcian velocities inside the pores, the flow inside the orifices of acoustic liners is fully turbulent, with a magnitude of the wall-normal velocity fluctuations comparable to the peak in the near wall cycle. We provide clear evidence a fully rough regime for acoustic liners, also confirmed by the increasing relevance of pressure drag. Once the fully rough asymptote is reached, canonical acoustic liners provide an added drag comparable to sand-grain roughness with viscous-scaled height matching the inverse of the viscous-scaled Forchheimer permeability of the plate.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy is a well-developed field with theoretical and experimental advances that have aided multiple fields including chemistry, biology and physics. However, accurate quantum dynamical simulations based on model Hamiltonians are need to interpret the corresponding multi-dimensional spectral signals properly. In this article, we present the initial release of our code, QuDPy (quantum dynamics in python) which addresses the need for a robust numerical platform for performing quantum dynamics simulations based on model systems, including open quantum systems. An important feature of our approach is that one can specify various high-order optical response pathways in the form of double-sided Feynman diagrams via a straightforward input syntax that specifies the time-ordering of ket-sided or bra-sided optical interactions acting upon the time-evolving density matrix of the system. We use the quantum dynamics capabilities of QuTip for simulating the spectral response of complex systems to compute essentially any n-th-order optical response of the model system. We provide a series of example calculations to illustrate the utility of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates the capabilities of an entangled photon-pair source at telecom wavelengths, based on a photonic integrated Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonator, with monolithically integrated piezoelectric frequency tuning. Previously, frequency tuning of photon-pairs generated by microresonators has only been demonstrated using thermal control. However, these have limited actuation bandwidth, and are not compatible with cryogenic environments. Here, the frequency-tunable photon-pair generation capabilities of a Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonator with a monolithically integrated aluminium nitride layer are shown. In addition, fast-frequency locking of the microresonator to an external laser is demonstrated, with a resulting locking bandwidth many times higher than achieved with previous thermal locking schemes. These abilities add to the existing `photonic toolbox' available when using such integrated microresonators as photon-pair sources, and will have direct application in future schemes which interface such sources with quantum memories based on e.g. trapped-ion or rare-earth ion schemes.

    "abstract": "Neural network quantum states (NQS), incorporating with variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, are shown to be a promising way to investigate quantum many-body physics. Whereas vanilla VMC methods perform one gradient update per sample, we introduce a novel objective function with proximal optimization (PO) that enables multiple updates via reusing the mismatched samples. Our VMC-PO method keeps the advantage of the previous importance sampling gradient optimization algorithm [L. Yang, {\\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Research {\\bf 2}, 012039(R)(2020)] that efficiently uses sampled states. PO mitigates the numerical instabilities during network updates, which is similar to stochastic reconfiguration (SR) methods, but achieves an alternative and simpler implement with lower computational complexity. We investigate the performance of our VMC-PO algorithm for ground-state searching with a 1-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and 2-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice, and demonstrate that the reached ground-state energies are comparable to state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Generating multiple entangled qubit pairs between distributed nodes is a prerequisite for a future quantum internet. To achieve a practicable generation rate, standard protocols based on photonic qubits require multiple long-term quantum memories, which remains a significant experimental challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol based on $2^m$-dimensional time-bin photonic qudits that allow for the simultaneous generation of multiple ($m$) entangled pairs between two distributed qubit registers and outline a specific implementation of the protocol based on cavity-mediated spin-photon interactions. By adopting the qudit protocol, the required qubit memory time is independent of the transmission loss between the nodes in contrast to standard qubit approaches. As such, our protocol can significantly boost the performance of near-term quantum networks. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in silicon photonics promise to revolutionize modern technology by improving performance of everyday devices in multiple fields. However, as the industry moves into a mass fabrication phase, the problem of effective testing of integrated silicon photonics devices remains to be solved. A cost-efficient manner that reduces schedule risk needs to involve automated testing of multiple devices that share common characteristics such as input-output coupling mechanisms, but at the same time needs to be generalizable to multiple types of devices and scenarios. In this paper we present a neural network-based automated system designed for in-plane fiber-chip-fiber testing, characterization, and active alignment of silicon photonic devices that use process-design-kit library edge couplers. The presented approach combines state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with time-series analysis, in order to control a testing setup that can process multiple devices and can be easily tuned to incorporate additional hardware. The system can operate at vacuum or atmospheric pressures and maintains stability for fairly long time periods in excess of a month. ",

Standard approaches to tomographic problems rely on the maximum-likelihood estimation, providing the most likely transformation to yield the same outcomes as a set of experimental projective measurements. The performances of this method strongly depend on the number of input measurements and the numerical minimization routine that is adopted. Here we investigate the application of genetic and machine-learning approaches to this problem, finding that both allow for more accurate reconstructions and faster operations when processing a set of projective measurements very close to the minimal one. We also apply these techniques to the case of space-dependent polarization transformations, providing an experimental characterization of the optical action of complex spin-orbit metasurfaces. We expect these results to lay the groundwork for the optimization of tomographic approaches in more general quantum processes, including non-unitary gates and operations in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

    "abstract": "In the studies of piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) systems, literature has shown that circuit advancement has a significant effect on the enhancement of energy harvesting capability in resonance. On the other hand, some recent studies using the phase-variable (PV) synchronized switch technologies have found that the advanced circuit solutions can also broaden the harvesting bandwidth. However, the available span of the electrically induced dynamics by the existing energy harvesting circuits was not properly defined and demonstrated. Performance comparison among different circuits cannot be fairly achieved without using a common theoretical language. Given these, this paper provides an impedance-based analysis and comparison on the electromechanical joint dynamics of the PEH systems using different interface circuits. Given that the resonance tunability by circuit solutions has received no attention in the conventional ideal model of kinetic energy harvester, we firstly propose a more inclusive ideal model for better generalization. In practice, it was proven that the attainable dynamic ranges of the practical energy harvesting circuits are only some subsets of the ideal realm. A detailed quantitative study on the attainable ranges of the PV circuit solutions is provided after the introduction of the ideal target. Simulation and experimental results of different interface circuits show good agreement with the theoretical analysis. It can be concluded that the resonance tunability strongly depends on the achievable extent in the reactive direction of the equivalent impedance plane. In practice, the electromechanical coupling conditions and dielectric loss might also influence the resonance tunability. The general ideal model and quantitative impedance analysis provided in this paper help guide the future design effort towards high-capability and broadband PEH systems. ",
