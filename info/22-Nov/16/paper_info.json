    "title": "Acoustic waves in the Jovian dusty magnetosphere: A brief review and  meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "The omnipresence of dust particulates in space and astrophysical plasmas has been attracting numerous researchers to study the collective excitation and propagation dynamics of different eigen-mode structures in diversifed astrocosmic circumstances for years. It includes planetary rings, interplanetary space, cometary tails, asteroid zones, planetary atmospheres, etc. The ubiquitous charged dust particulates possess collective degrees of dynamic freedom resulting in the excitation of relatively low-frequency modes, such as dust-ion-acoustic waves (DIAWs), dust-acoustic waves (DAWs), dust-Coulomb waves (DCWs), and so forth. An interesting prevalency of dusty plasma stability research lies in the Jovian magnetosphere (i.e., Jovian plasmas), embedded inside the supersonic solar wind. A brief review of the updated research works on dust-acoustic waves and related collective instability dynamics in the presence of trapped plasma particles is presented herein. The key aim of the proposed explorative meta-analysis is rooted in outlining concisely the main up-to-date investigations on such collective instability processes chronologically. An especial attention is given primarily to the thermostatistical distribution laws of the constitutive lighter electrons and ions against the heavier positively charged dust grains (microspheres). The trapping mechanism of both the lighter species (electrons+ions) is another additive feature revisited here properly. Finally, we clearly extrapolate a number of futuristic directions in light of sensible novelties with a wider scope, both horizontally as well as vertically. ",

    "abstract": "Petawatt-class lasers can produce multi-GeV electron beams through laser wakefield electron acceleration. As a by-product, the accelerated electron beams can generate broad synchrotron-like radiation known as betatron radiation. In the present work, we measure the properties of the radiation produced from 2 GeV, 215 pC electron beams, which shows a broad radiation spectrum with a critical energy of 515 keV, extending up to MeV photon energies and 10 mrad divergence. Due to its high energy and flux, such radiation is an ideal candidate for gamma-ray radiography of dense objects. We employed a compact betatron radiation setup operated at relatively high-repetition rates (0.1 Hz) and used it to scan cm-sized objects: a DRAM circuit, BNC and SMA connectors, a padlock and a gas jet nozzle. GEANT4 simulations were carried out to reproduce the radiograph of the gas jet. The setup and the radiation source can reveal the interior structure of the objects at the sub-mm level, proving that it can further be applied to diagnose cracks or holes in various components. The radiation source presented here is a valuable tool for non-destructive inspection and for applications in high-energy-density physics such as nuclear fusion. ",

The ultrasound sensitivity of the cavity optomechanical system is fundamentally limited by the thermal noise. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the thermal-noise-limited sensitivity of a WGM microdisk ultrasound sensor, and optimize the sensitivity by varying the radius and thickness of the microdisk, as well as using a trench structure around the disk. Using a microdisk with a radius of 300 um and thickness of 2 um, a peak sensitivity of 1.18 uPa Hz^{-1/2} is achieved at 82.6 kHz, which is to our knowledge the record sensitivity among the cavity optomechanical ultrasound sensors. Such high sensitivity can improve the detection range of air-coupled ultrasound sensing technology. ",

    "title": "Time-dependent theory of optical electro- and magnetostriction",
    "abstract": "Electrostriction, the deformation of dielectric materials under the influence of an electric field, is of continuous interest in optics. The classic experiment by Hakim and Higham [Proc. Phys. Soc. 80, 190 (1962)] for a stationary field supports a different formula of the electrostrictive force density than the recent experiment by Astrath et al. [Light Sci. Appl. 11, 103 (2022)] for an optical field. In this work, we study the origin of this difference by developing a time-dependent covariant theory of force densities in photonic materials. When a light pulse propagates in a bulk dielectric, the field-induced force density consists of two parts: (i) The optical wave momentum force density carries the wave momentum of light and drives forward a mass density wave of the covariant coupled field-material state of light. (ii) The optostrictive force density arises from the atomic density dependence of the electric and magnetic field energy densities. It represents an optical Lorentz-force-law-based generalization of the electro- and magnetostrictive force densities well known for static electromagnetic fields and derived from the principle of virtual work. Since the work done by the optostrictive force density is not equal to the change of the field energy density during the contraction of the material, we have to describe this difference by optostriction-related dissipation terms to fulfill the energy conservation. The detailed physical model of the dissipation is left for further works. The optostrictive force density can be understood in terms of field-induced pair interactions inside the material. Because of the related action and reaction effects, this force density cannot contribute to the net momentum transfer of the optical field. We also use the theory to simulate the propagation of a Gaussian light pulse through a dielectric material. ",

Recently, the maximum operating temperature of THz QCLs was improved to 250 K, and the achievement revitalized hope in the THz community in pursuit of higher temperature operations. In this paper, we report on further improvement in operating temperature to ~261 K (-12 0C) by judiciously optimizing key parameters and discuss the challenges ahead in achieving room temperature operation.

    "abstract": "Photonic computing is attracting increasing interest to accelerate information processing in machine learning applications. The mode-competition dynamics of multimode semiconductor lasers is useful for solving the multi-armed bandit problem in reinforcement learning for computing applications. In this study, we numerically evaluate the chaotic mode-competition dynamics in a multimode semiconductor laser with optical feedback and injection. We observe the chaotic mode-competition dynamics among the longitudinal modes and control them by injecting an external optical signal into one of the longitudinal modes. We define the dominant mode as the mode with the maximum intensity; the dominant-mode ratio for the injected mode increases as the optical injection strength increases. We find that the characteristics of the dominant mode ratio in terms of the optical injection strength are different among the modes owing to the different optical feedback phases. We propose a control technique for the characteristics of the dominant mode ratio by precisely tuning the initial optical frequency detuning between the optical injection signal and injected mode. We also evaluate the relationship between the region for the large dominant mode ratio and injection locking range. The region for the large dominant mode ratio does not correspond to the injection-locking range. This discrepancy results from the complex mode-competition dynamics in multimode semiconductor lasers with both optical feedback and injection. This control technique of chaotic mode-competition dynamics in multimode lasers is promising for applications in reinforcement learning and reservoir computing as photonic artificial intelligence. ",

    "abstract": "Coherent nonlinear optical micro-spectroscopy is a frequently used tool in modern material science, as it is sensitive to many different local observables, which comprise, among others, crystal symmetry and vibrational properties. The richness in information, however, may come with challenges in data interpretation, as one has to disentangle the many different effects like multiple reflections, phase jumps at interfaces, or the influence of the Guoy-phase. In order to facilitate interpretation, the work presented here proposes an easy-to-use semi-analytical modeling ansatz, that bases upon known analytical solutions using Gaussian beams. Specifically, we apply this ansatz to compute nonlinear optical responses of (thin film) optical materials. We try to conserve the meaning of intuitive parameters like the Gouy-phase and the nonlinear coherent interaction length. In particular, the concept of coherence length is extended, which is a must when using focal beams. The model is subsequently applied to exemplary cases of second-harmonic and third-harmonic generation. We observe a very good agreement with experimental data and furthermore, despite the constraints and limits of the analytical ansatz, our model performs similarly well as when using more rigorous simulations. However, it outperforms the latter in terms of computational power, requiring more than three orders less computational time and less performant computer systems. ",

In particular, we theoretically demonstrate that optical levitation and center-of-mass ground-state cooling of silicon nanoparticles in vacuum is not only experimentally feasible but it offers enhanced performance over widely used silica particles, in terms of both trap frequency and trap depth. Moreover, we show that, by adjusting the detuning of the trapping laser with respect to the particle's resonance, the sign of the polarizability becomes negative, enabling levitation in the minimum of laser intensity e.g. at the nodes of a standing wave. The latter opens the door to trapping nanoparticles in the optical near-field combining red and blue-detuned frequencies, in analogy to two-level atoms, which is of interest for generating strong coupling to photonic nanostructures and short-distance force sensing.

We review this foundation, addressing issues such as the sense in which space and time are emergent, the notion of locality, the role of truncation that enables physical computations on finite graphs, the problem of time, and the characterization of the observable quantities in quantum gravity.

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the advances of artificial intelligence with various applications in engineering. Recently, artificial neural network empowered inverse design for metasurfaces has been developed that can design on-demand meta-atoms with diverse shapes and high performance, where the design process based on artificial intelligence is fast and automatic. However, once the inverse-designed static meta-atom is fabricated, the function of the metasurface is fixed. Reconfigurable metasurfaces can realize dynamic functions, while applying artificial intelligence to design reconfigurable meta-atoms inversely has not been reported yet. Here, we present a deep-learning empowered inverse design method for freeform reconfigurable metasurfaces, which can generate on-demand reconfigurable coding meta-atoms at self-defined frequency bands. To reduce the scale of dataset, a decoupling method of the reconfigurable meta-atom based on microwave network theory is proposed at first, which can convert the inverse design process for reconfigurable coding meta-atoms to the inverse design for static structures. A convolutional neural network model is trained to predict the responses of free-shaped meta-atoms, and the genetic algorithm is applied to generate the optimal structure patterns rapidly. As a demonstration of concept, several inverse-designed examples are generated with different self-defined spectrum responses in microwave band, and an inverse-designed wideband reconfigurable metasurface prototype is fabricated and measured for beam scanning applications with broad bandwidth. Our work paves the way for the fast and automatic design process of high-performance reconfigurable metasurfaces. ",
