    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel design of the triangular mesoscale Janus prisms for the generation of the long photonic hook. The numerical simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method are used to examine the formation mechanism of the photonic hook. The electric intensity distributions near the micro-prisms are calculated for operating at different re-fractive indices and spaces of the two triangular micro-prisms. The asymmetric vortexes of in-tensity distributions result in the long photonic hook with large bending angle. The length and the bending angle of the photonic hook are efficiently modulated by changing the space be-tween the two triangular micro-prisms. Moreover, the narrow width of the photonic hook is achieved beyond the diffraction limit. The triangular Janus micro-prisms have high potential for practical applications in optical tweezers, nanoparticle sorting and manipulation and photonic circuits. ",

    "abstract": "A highly adaptable and robust THz energy meter has been designed and implemented to detect energetic THz pulses from high intensity (greater than 1E18 watts per square centimeter) laser plasma interactions on OMEGA EP. THz radiation from the laser driven target is detected by a shielded pyrometer. A second identical pyrometer is used for background subtraction. The detector can be configured to detect THz pulses in the 1 mm to 30 microns (0.3 to 10 THz) range and pulse energies from joules to microjoules via changes in filtration, aperture size and position. Additional polarization selective filtration can also be used to determine THz pulse polarization. The design incorporates significant radiation and EMP shielding to survive and operate within the OMEGA EP radiation environment. We describe the design, operational principle, calibration and testing of the THz energy meter. The pyrometers were calibrated using a benchtop laser and show linear sensitivity up to 1000 nJ of absorbed energy. Initial results from four OMEGA EP THz experiments detected up to 15 microjoules at the detector, which can correspond to 100s of mJ depending on THz emission and reflection models. ",

During this transformation, the flat band is destroyed, but the Dirac cones remain and become tilted, with types I, II, and III occurring for different parameters. In this work, we first study these tilted Dirac cones using a tight-binding model, revealing how they can be engineered into the different types. We then demonstrate conical diffraction in a photonic lattice realization of the Lieb-kagome lattice using split-step beam propagation simulations, obtaining evidence of the presence of Dirac cones tilted in different directions. Finally, we performed experiments with photonic lattices laser-written in fused silica (SiO$_2$) to validate the results of the simulations. These studies advance the understanding of the Lieb-kagome lattice and tilted Dirac cones in general and provide a basis for further research into this interesting tunable lattice system. ",

    "abstract": "The Neutral Beam Injectors of the ITER experiment will rely on negative ion sources to produce 16.7 MW beams of H/D particles accelerated at 1 MeV. The prototype of these sources was built and is currently operated in the SPIDER experiment (Source for the Production of Ions o Deuterium Extracted from an RF plasma), part of the Neutral Beam Test Facility of Consorzio RFX, Padua. In SPIDER, the H-/D- ion source is coupled to a three grids 100 kV acceleration system. One of the main targets of the experimentation in SPIDER is to uniformly maximize the extracted current density; to achieve this it is important to study the density of negative ions available in proximity of the ion acceleration system. In SPIDER, line-integrated measurements of negative ion density are performed by a Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) diagnostic. Its principle of operation is based on the absorption of the photons of a laser beam pulse by H-/D- photo-detachment; the absorption detection is enhanced by trapping the laser pulse in an optical cavity, containing the absorbing medium (i.e. negative ions). The paper presents and discusses the CRDS diagnostic setup in SPIDER, including the first measurements of negative ion density, correlated to the main source parameters. ",

    "abstract": "The electron dynamics and the mechanisms of power absorption in radio-frequency (RF) driven, magnetically enhanced capacitively coupled plasmas (MECCPs) at low pressure are investigated. The device in focus is a geometrically asymmetric cylindrical magnetron with a radially nonuniform magnetic field in axial direction and an electric field in radial direction. The dynamics is studied analytically using the cold plasma model and a single-particle formalism, and numerically with the inhouse energy and charge conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions code ECCOPIC1S-M. It is found that the dynamics differs significantly from that of an unmagnetized reference discharge. In the magnetized region in front of the powered electrode, an enhanced electric field arises during sheath expansion and a reversed electric field during sheath collapse. Both fields are needed to ensure discharge sustaining electron transport against the confining effect of the magnetic field. The corresponding azimuthal ExB-drift can accelerate electrons into the inelastic energy range which gives rise to a new mechanism of RF power dissipation. It is related to the Hall current and is different in nature from Ohmic heating, as which it has been classified in previous literature. The new heating is expected to be dominant in many magnetized capacitively coupled discharges. It is proposed to term it the \"{\\mu}-mode\" to separate it from other heating modes. ",

The growth of TPD driven by an OAM light in a Laguerre-Gauss (LG) mode is investigated through three dimensional fluid simulations and theory. A theory based on the assumption that the electron plasma waves (EPWs) are locally driven by a number of local plane-wave lasers predicts the maximum growth rate proportional to the peak amplitude of the pump laser field and is verified by the simulations. The OAM conservation during its transportation from the laser to the TPD daughter EWPs is shown by both the theory and the simulations. The theory predicts generation of ~40T axial magnetic fields through the OAM absorption via TPD, which has perspective applications in the field of high energy density physics. ",

In our research, dispersion management triggers the complex interactions between solitons in the cavity. We reveal the smooth or reversible Hopf-type bifurcation transitions of dual-color soliton molecules (SMs) during collision by real-time spectral measurement technique of TS-DFT. The reversible transitions from stationary SM to vibrating SM, revealing that cavity parameters pass through a bifurcation point in the collision process without active external intervention. The numerical results confirm the universality of collision-induced bifurcation behavior. These findings provide new insights into collision dynamics in dual-wavelength ultrafast fiber lasers.

    "abstract": "The application of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) technology for weak-light detection at a single photon level has expanded thanks to its better photon detection efficiency in comparison to a conventional photomultiplier tube (PMT). SiPMs with large detection area have recently become commercially available, enabling applications where the photon flux is low both temporarily and spatially. On the other hand, several drawbacks exist in the usage of SiPMs such as a higher dark count rate, many readout channels, slow response time, and optical crosstalk; therefore, users need to carefully consider the trade-offs. This work presents a SiPM-embedded compact large-area photon detection module. Various techniques are adopted to overcome the disadvantages of SiPMs so that it can be generally utilized as an upgrade from a PMT. A simple cooling component and recently developed optical crosstalk suppression method are adopted to reduce the noise which is more serious for larger-area SiPMs. A dedicated readout circuit increases the response frequency and reduces the number of readout channels. We favorably compare this design with a conventional PMT and obtain both higher photon detection efficiency and larger-area acceptance. ",

    "abstract": "Wall-driven flow in square cavity has been studied extensively, yet it is more frequently for the rectangular cavity flow occurring in practical problems, and some flow characteristics about rectangular cavity have not been fully investigated. As a promising numerical simulation tool, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is employed to simulate the lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity in this paper. First, the code is validated for the standard square cavity, the velocity profiles, stream function values and center positions of the primary and second vortexes at different Re are presented and compared with previous researches. Then, the eddy dynamics of rectangular cavities is simulated and discussed with Reynolds number (Re) in the range of 4000-8000 and vertical to horizontal axis ratio (Ar) varied from 0.4 to 2.0, and the streamline and center migration of the primary vortex are drawn realistically for rectangular cavity. In the end, the steady, periodic, aperiodic and unstable phenomenon in the rectangular cavity is produced by LBM, Re and Ar which play the significant role in the state transition of lid-driven rectangular cavity flow are analyzed and summarized in detail. By the LBM numerical simulation with 500x(500*Ar) grid, we have discovered that the flow state in the rectangular cavity with a fixed Ar changes monotonically from stable state, periodic state to aperiodic and unstable state with the increase of Re, while the flow state in the rectangular cavity with a fixed Re varies non-monotonically with the increase of Ar. Additionally, the cycle length of periodic states varies with the change of Ar and Re. ",

These mirrors are particularly suited for use in optical microcavities, where arbitrary potential landscapes for photons may be constructed. Experiments with photon Bose-Einstein condensates, where high cavity finesse is essential, is one area that has greatly benefited from this approach. A thorough characterization of our implementation of this method is given in this paper, and its physical origins are investigated. In particular, our measurements show that laser direct writing of such mirrors has a reversible and a permanent component, where the reversible process originates from the thermal expansion of the surface and allows a simple yet precise way to temporarily modify the shape of the mirror. Scanning electron microscope cross-sectional images suggest that the permanent part of the nanostructuring process is due to thermally induced pore formation and enlargement in the tantalum oxide layers of the used dielectric mirror.

In a driven nonlinear system, two or more tunneling paths may coherently interfere, enhancing or cancelling the tunnel effect. Since individual quantum systems are difficult to control, this interference effect has only been studied for the lowest energy states of many-body ensembles. In our experiment, we show a coherent cancellation of the tunneling amplitude in the ground and excited state manifold of an individual squeeze-driven Kerr oscillator, a consequence of the destructive interference of tunneling paths in the classically forbidden region. The tunnel splitting vanishes periodically in the spectrum as a function of the frequency of the squeeze-drive, with the periodicity given by twice the Kerr coefficient. This resonant cancellation, combined with an overall exponential reduction of tunneling as a function of both amplitude and frequency of the squeeze-drive, reduces drastically the well-switching rate under incoherent environment-induced evolution. The control of tunneling via interference effects can be applied to quantum computation, molecular, and nuclear physics. ",
