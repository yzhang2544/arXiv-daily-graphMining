    "abstract": "Electric-field-controlled F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Rydberg helium (He) atoms and ground-state ammonia (NH$_3$) molecules has been studied at translational temperatures below 100 mK. The experiments were performed in an intrabeam collision apparatus with pulsed supersonic beams of NH$_3$ seeded in He. A range of F\\\"orster resonances, between triplet Rydberg states in He with principal quantum numbers of 38, 39 and 40, and the inversion intervals in NH$_3$ were investigated. Resonance widths as low as $100\\pm20$ MHz were observed for Rydberg-Rydberg transitions with electric dipole transition moments of 3270 D. These widths result from binary collisions at a mean center-of-mass speed of $19.3\\pm2.6$ m/s. For transitions in which the initially prepared Rydberg states were strongly polarized, with large induced static electric dipole moments, van der Waals interactions between the collision partners increased the resonance widths to $\\sim750$ MHz. From measurements of the rate of FRET for the narrowest resonances observed, a density of NH$_3$ of $(9.4\\pm0.3)\\times10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the upper ground-state inversion sublevel in the interaction region of the apparatus was determined non-destructively.

    "abstract": "The interplay between symmetry and topology led to the discovery of symmetry-protected topological phases in Hermitian systems, including topological insulators and topological superconductors. However, the intrinsic symmetry-protected topological characteristics of non-Hermitian systems still await exploration. Here, we investigate experimentally the topological transition associated with the inversion of non-Hermitian band structures in an optical lattice. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that the winding number associated with the symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum is not a conserved quantity after band inversion. To define a topological invariant, we propose the skyrmion number given by spawning in momentum space a pseudo-spin with the polarisation vortex as the in-plane component and the band-index as the pseudo-spin direction at the origin. This leads to a topological transition from an antimeron to an meron-like texture through band inversion, while always conserving the half-charge skyrmion number. We foresee the use of skyrmion number to explore exotic singularities in various non-Hermitian physical system. ",

Existing video disdrometers measure drop size distributions, but underestimate small raindrops and are impractical for widespread always-on IoT deployment. We propose an innovative method of measuring droplet size and velocity using a neuromorphic event camera. These dynamic vision sensors asynchronously output a sparse stream of pixel brightness changes. Droplets falling through the plane of focus create events generated by the motion of the droplet. Droplet size and speed are inferred from the stream of events. Using an improved hard disk arm actuator to reliably generate artificial raindrops, our experiments show small errors of 7% (maximum mean absolute percentage error) for droplet sizes from 0.3 to 2.5 mm and speeds from 1.3 m/s to 8.0 m/s. Each droplet requires the processing of only a few hundred to thousands of events, potentially enabling low-power always-on disdrometers that consume power proportional to the rainfall rate. ",

In particular, we demonstrate the appearance of an analog Zitterbewegung effect, a term which translates as 'trembling motion' in english, which was originally proposed for relativistic Dirac electrons and consists of the oscillations of the center of mass of a wavepacket in the direction perpendicular to its propagation. For a planar microcavity we observe regular Zitterbewegung oscillations whose amplitude and period depend on the wavevector of the polaritons. We then extend these results to a honeycomb lattice of coupled microcavity resonators. Compared to the planar cavity such lattices are inherently more tuneable and versatile, allowing simulation of the Hamilitonians of a wide range of important physical systems. We observe an oscillation pattern related to the presence of the spin-split Dirac cones in the dispersion. In both cases the experimentally observed oscillations are in good agreement with theoretical modelling and independently measured bandstructure parameters, providing strong evidence for the observation of Zitterbewegung.

Spontaneous soliton formation via Kerr parametric oscillation is a promising generation principle in these frequency combs, and has been demonstrated in several material platforms over the past decade. Of these materials, AlGaAs has one of the largest Kerr nonlinearity coefficients allowing low pump threshold comb generation. However, bright soliton generation using this material has only been possible at cryogenic temperature because of the large thermo-optic effect at room temperature, which hinders stable access to the soliton regime. Here, we report self-stabilized single soliton generation in AlGaAs microresonators at room temperature by utilizing a rising soliton step in large free-spectral-range resonators. With sub-milliWatt optical pump power, 1 THz repetition-rate soliton generation is demonstrated. Perfect soliton crystal formation and soliton breather states are also observed. Besides the advantages of large optical nonlinearity, the devices are natural candidates for integration with III-V pump lasers. ",

In laser interference lithography (LIL), using such Gaussian shaped beams leads to an inhomogeneous exposure of the substrate. As a result, dimensions of lithography defined features vary significantly across the substrate. In most LIL setups, pinholes are used as filters to remove optical noise. Following a concept proposed by Hariharan et. al. a phase mask can be added to these pinholes. In theory, this modification results in a more uniform beam profile, and, if applied as spatial filters in LIL, in improved exposure and hence feature size uniformity. Here, we report on the first successful fabrication of such elements and demonstrate their use in an LIL setup to reduce feature dimension variations from 47.2% to 27.5% using standard and modified pinholes, respectively.

However, fundamental limit exists for low noise microcomb generation, especially in low size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) package. Here we resolve such low noise challenge to operate a microcomb close to its low quantum noise limit, in a direct-diode-pump and thus low SWaP-C setup. Such result is triggered by using fiber Fabry-Perot resonators (FFPRs) with high quality factors up to 4.0*10^9. Automated turnkey operation has been achieved within a compact setup size of 85 mm * 90 mm * 25 mm. Low phase noise of -80 and -105 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz, -106 and -125 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz, -133 and -148 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz is achieved at 10.1 GHz and 1.7 GHz repetition frequencies, respectively.

Indeed, using this family of fibers becomes nowadays an overarching strategy for building a multitude of optical systems ranging from beam delivery devices to optical sources and sensors. In most applications, an effective single-mode operation is desired and, as such, the fiber microstructure or the light launching setups are typically designed for achieving such a behavior. Alternatively, one can identify the use of large-core multimode hollow-core fibers as a promising avenue for the development of new photonic devices. Thus, in this manuscript, we propose and demonstrate the utilization of a large-core tubular-lattice fiber for accomplishing a speckle-based displacement sensor, which has been built up by inserting and suitably dislocating a single-mode fiber inside the void core of the hollow fiber. The work reported herein encompasses both simulation and experimental studies on the evolution of the multimode intensity distributions within the device as well as the demonstration of a displacement sensor with an estimated resolution of 0.7 {\\mu}m. We understand that this investigation identifies a new opportunity for the employment of large-core hollow fibers within the sensing framework hence widening the gamut of applications of this family of fibers.

In case of singular flat bands, these conventional localized flat band states have been found to be incomplete leading to the existence of so-called noncontractible loop states (NLSs) with nontrivial real space topology. Here, we experimentally and analytically demonstrate that a 2D photonic borophene lattice can host NLSs without a CLS counterpart because of a band that is flat only along high-symmetry lines and dispersive along others. We hence dispel the conventional wisdom that NLSs are necessarily linked to robust boundary modes due to a bulk-boundary correspondence. Originating from band touching protected by the band flatness, NLSs play a key role in studying the fundamental physics of flat band systems. Our results truly transform the current understanding of flat bands and could readily be transferred to a 2D material in the form of a planar sheet of boron atoms. ",

Recently, artificial neural network empowered inverse design for metasurfaces has been developed that can design on-demand meta-atoms with diverse shapes and high performance, where the design process based on artificial intelligence is fast and automatic. However, once the inverse-designed static meta-atom is fabricated, the function of the metasurface is fixed. Reconfigurable metasurfaces can realize dynamic functions, while applying artificial intelligence to design practical reconfigurable meta-atoms inversely has not been reported yet. Here, we present a deep-learning-empowered inverse design method for freeform reconfigurable metasurfaces, which can generate on-demand reconfigurable coding meta-atoms at self-defined frequency bands. To reduce the scale of dataset, a decoupling method of the reconfigurable meta-atom based on microwave network theory is proposed at first, which can convert the inverse design process for reconfigurable coding meta-atoms to the inverse design for static structures. A convolutional neural network model is trained to predict the responses of free-shaped meta-atoms, and the genetic algorithm is applied to generate the optimal structure patterns rapidly. As a demonstration of concept, several inverse-designed examples are generated with different self-defined spectrum responses in microwave band, and an inverse-designed wideband reconfigurable metasurface prototype is fabricated and measured for beam scanning applications with broad bandwidth. Our work paves the way for the fast and automatic design process of high-performance reconfigurable metasurfaces. ",

The two detectors together will have hundreds of Detection Units with Digital Optical Modules kept vertically by buoyancy forming a large 3D optical array for detecting the Cherenkov light produced after the neutrino interactions. To properly reconstruct the direction of the incoming neutrino, the position of the DOMs, which are not static due to the sea currents, must be monitored. For this purpose, the detector is equipped with an Acoustic Positioning System, which is composed of fixed acoustic emitters on the sea bottom, a hydrophone in each DU base, and a piezoceramic sensor in each DOM, as acoustic receivers. This network of acoustic sensors can be used not only for positioning, but also for acoustic monitoring studies such as bioacoustics, ship noise monitoring, environmental noise control, and acoustic neutrinos detection. This work explores the possibility of creating a trigger for saving the data for ultra-high-energy neutrino candidates detected acoustically by the hydrophones. The acoustic signal caused by the neutrino interaction in a fluid is a short-time duration Bipolar Pulse extremely directive and with a Fourier transform extending over a wide range of frequencies. A study of signal detection, has been done by simulating BP produced by the interaction of a UHE neutrino at 1 km from the detector at zero-degree incidence added to the experimental real acoustic data. Finally, a trigger proposal has been developed in order to record candidates of BPs and it has been tested. The number of candidates per second, precision, and recall have been monitored according to the cuts applied and parameters calculated by the algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Natural optical activity is the paradigmatic example of an effect originating in the weak spatial inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field on the atomic scale. Such effects are well described in molecules by the multipole theory of electromagnetism, where the coupling to light is treated semiclassically beyond the electric-dipole approximation. That theory has two shortcomings: it is limited to bounded systems, and its building blocks - the multipole transition moments - are origin dependent. In this work, we recast the multipole theory in a translationally-invariant form that remains valid for periodic crystals. Working in the independent-particle approximation, we introduce ''intrinsic'' multipole transition moments that are origin independent and transform covariantly under gauge transformations of the Bloch states. Electric-dipole transitions are given by the interband Berry connection, while magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole transitions are described by matrix generalizations of the intrinsic magnetic moment and quantum metric. In addition to multipolar terms, the response of crystals at first order in the wavevector of light contains band-dispersion terms that have no counterpart in molecular theories. The rotatory-strength sum rule for crystals is found to be equivalent to the topological constraint for a vanishing chiral magnetic effect in equilibrium, and the formalism is validated by numerical calculations on a tight-binding model.
