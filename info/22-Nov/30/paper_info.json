    "abstract": "A novel design of a grating-based optical pulse compressor is proposed. The proposed compressor provides a large group delay dispersion while keeping the compressor linear size small. The design of the proposed compressor is based on a traditional Treacy compressor with a straightforward modification of inserting two lenses between the compressor's gratings. This simple alternation aims to substantially increase group delay dispersion of the compressor or alternatively to decrease the compressor size while maintaining its group delay dispersion. A theoretical description of the enhanced compressor has been developed in the paraxial approximation. A detailed numerical model has been built to calculate the compressor parameters more accurately. These theoretical studies have revealed that the enhanced optical compressor provides a significant increase in the group delay dispersion compared to a standard Treacy compressor. ",

    "abstract": "It is shown that a sub-luminal electromagnetic plasma wave, propagating in phase with a background sub-luminal gravitational wave in a dispersive medium, can undergo parametric amplification. For this phenomena to occur, the dispersive characteristics of the two waves must properly match. The response frequencies of the two waves (medium dependent) must lie within a definite and restrictive range. The combined dynamics is represented by a Whitaker-Hill equation, the quintessential model for parametric instabilities. The exponential growth of the electromagnetic wave is displayed at the resonance; the plasma wave grows at the expense of the background gravitational wave. Different physical scenarios, where the phenomenon can be possible, are discussed. ",

The finite chemical potential is provided by the electronic density, which induces a finite photon mass that depends on local plasma variables and allows the condensation to occur. We derive an equation that models the evolution of the photon-mode occupancies, with Compton scattering taken into account as the mechanism of thermalization. The kinetic evolution of the photon spectrum is solved numerically, and we find evidences of condensation for realistic plasma parameters, $n_e\\sim 10^{12}-10^{16}\\; \\text{cm}^{-3}$. The critical temperature scales linearly with the number of photons, and we find high condensate fractions at room temperature, for reasonable cavity lengths ($ 1-10$ mm) and photon numbers ($10^4-10^6$).

    "abstract": "1. Passive acoustic monitoring of biodiversity is growing fast, as it offers an alternative to traditional aural point count surveys, with the possibility to deploy long-term acoustic surveys in large and complex natural environments. However, there is still a clear need to evaluate how the frequency-and distancedependent attenuation of sound as well as the ambient sound level impact the acoustic detection distance of the soniferous species in natural environments over the diel cycles and across seasons. This is of great importance to avoid pseudoreplication and to provide relevant biodiversity indicators, including species richness, species abundance and species density. 2. To address the issue of detection distance, we tested a field-based protocol in a Neotropical rainforest (French Guiana, France) and in an Alpine coniferous forest (Jura, France). This standardized and repeatable method consists in a recording session of the ambient sound directly followed by an experiment using a calibrated white noise sound broadcast at different positions along a 100 m linear transect. We then used acoustic laws to reveal the basic physics behind sound propagation attenuation. 3. We demonstrate that habitat attenuation in two different kinds of forests can be modelled by an exponential decay law with a linear dependence on frequency and distance. We also report that habitat attenuation, as first approximation, can be summarized by a single value, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat. 4. Finally, we show that the detection distance can be predicted knowing the contribution of each attenuation factor, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat, the ambient sound pressure level and the amplitude and frequency bandwidth characteristics of the transmitted sound. We show that the detection 1 distance mostly depends on the ambient sound and may vary by a factor of up to 5 over the diel cycle and across seasons. These results reinforce the need to take into account the variation of the detection distance when performing passive acoustic surveys and producing reliable biodiversity indicators. ",

    "abstract": "The development of the advanced Radio Frequency Timer of electrons is described. It is based on a helical deflector, which performs circular or elliptical sweeps of keV electrons, by means of 500 MHz radio frequency field. By converting a time distribution of incident electrons to a hit position distribution on a circle or ellipse, this device achieves extremely precise timing. Streak Cameras, based on similar principles, routinely operate in the ps and sub-ps time domain, but have substantial slow readout system. Here, we report a device, where the position sensor, consisting of microchannel plates and a delay-line anode, produces ~ns duration pulses which can be processed by using regular fast electronics. A photon sensor based on this technique, the Radio Frequency Photo-Multiplier Tube (RFPMT), has demonstrated a timing resolution of ~10 ps and a time stability of ~0.5 ps, FWHM. This makes the apparatus highly suited for Time Correlated Single Photon Counting which is widely used in optical microscopy and tomography of biological samples. The first application in lifetime measurements of quantum states of graphene, under construction at the A. I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory (AANL), is outlined. This is followed by a description of potential RFPMT applications in time-correlated Diffuse Optical Tomography, time-correlated Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy, hybrid FRET/STED nanoscopy and Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography.

    "abstract": "Information encoding in barcodes using magnetic-based technology is a unique strategy to read data buried underneath non-transparent surfaces since a direct line-of-sight between the code and the reader is not required. This technology is of particular interest in secure labelling and recyclable packaging applications. However, current magnetic reading heads, such as those employed for magnetic ink character recognition, need to be placed in contact with the magnetic structures, limiting the depths at which the information can be read. This paper describes a strategy to overcome that limitation by replacing the traditional inductive heads with tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) sensors. Soft-magnetic codes can be printed using conventional LaserJet toners and, by having their magnetisation set with a permanent magnet included in the device, the resulting magnetic field can be read using a TMR sensor. We demonstrate that such a device can read barcodes at depths of at least 1 mm. It can also resolve individual structures as thin as 200 {\\mu}m when used in contact. ",

However, the description of time-varying materials has been primarily limited to regimes where material resonances (i.e., dispersion) can be neglected. In this work, we describe how the optics of these dispersive time-varying materials emerges from microscopic quantum mechanical models of time-driven systems. Our results are based on a framework for describing the optics of dispersive time-varying materials through quantum mechanical linear response theory. Importantly, we clarify how response functions for time-varying materials are connected to energy transfer. We provide three examples of our framework applied to systems which can be used to model a wide variety of experiments: few level models that can describe atoms, spins, or superconducting qubits, oscillator models which can describe the strong response of polar insulators, and strongly driven atom models which can describe the highly nonperturbative optical response of materials undergoing high harmonic generation. We anticipate that our results will be broadly applicable to electromagnetic phenomena in strongly time-varying systems. ",

Secondly, it aims to examine the future research agenda according to different perspectives.

    "abstract": "The interplay between collective optical response and molecular static and dynamic disorder is studied using simple effective Hamiltonians for an ensemble of two-level emitters inside and outside a single-mode cavity. We model environmental disorder by randomly modulating the molecular transition frequencies and the coupling between the emitters and the electromagnetic field. We also consider effects of intermolecular interactions and orientational disorder. We investigate how these effects lead to new features in the steady state absorption (outside the cavity), transmission spectra (inside the cavity) and the yield of local molecular processes such as a unimolecular reaction. Outside the cavity, the collective behavior is manifested in the linewidth of the steady state absorption, the emission spectrum, and the local chemical yield. Inside the cavity, however, the collective behavior primarily determines the Rabi splitting. Effects of intermolecular interactions under orientational disorder are also studied. For the most part, for all types of disorder, if we increase disorder, we find a reduction in the collective nature of the molecular response (smaller effective N), and therefore, the Rabi splitting contraction occurs with orientational disorder. Moreover, we find that static disorder is more destructive to collective behavior than dynamic disorder. ",
