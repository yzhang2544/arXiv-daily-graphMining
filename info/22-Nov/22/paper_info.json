    "abstract": "The RESEDA (Resonant Spin-Echo for Diverse Applications) instrument has been optimized for neutron scattering measurements of quasi-elastic and inelastic processes over a wide parameter range. One spectrometer arm of RESEDA is configured for the MIEZE (Modulation of Intensity with Zero Effort) technique, where the measured signal is an oscillation in neutron intensity over time prepared by two precisely tuned radio-frequency (RF) flippers. With MIEZE, all spin-manipulations are performed before the beam reaches the sample, and thus the signal from sample scattering is not disrupted by any depolarizing conditions there (i.e. magnetic materials and fields). The MIEZE spectrometer is being further optimized for the requirements of small angle neutron scattering (MIASANS), a versatile combination of the spatial and dynamical resolving power of both techniques. We present the current status of (i) the newly installed superconducting solenoids as part of the RF flippers to significantly extend the dynamic range (ii) the development and installation of a new detector on a translation stage within a new larger SANS-type vacuum vessel for flexibility with angular coverage and resolution, and (iii) the efforts to reduce background.

We demonstrate a PhC membrane that we use as one mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity with finesse as high as $F=35,000(500)$, corresponding to a record high PhC reflectivity of $R=0.999835(6)$. The fundamental mechanical frequency is 426 kHz, more than twice the optical linewidth, placing it firmly in the resolved-sideband regime. The mechanical quality factor in vacuum is $Q=1.1(1)\\times 10^6$, allowing us to achieve values of the single-photon cooperativity as high as ${\\cal C}_0=6.6\\times10^{-3}$. We easily see optomechanical bistability as hysteresis in the cavity transmission. As the input power is raised well beyond the bistability threshold, dynamical backaction induces strong mechanical oscillation above 1~MHz, even in the presence of air damping. This platform will facilitate advances in optomechanics, precision sensing, and applications of optomechanically-induced bistability. ",

Our system can measure the stiffness of hard (GPa) materials including bones with mm-scale resolution and characterize soft, viscoelastic materials from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The dispersion of Rayleigh surface waves over the wide frequency range allowed us to profile depth-dependent shear modulus (10 kPa to 100 MPa) in cartilages ex vivo and the human skin in vivo.

    "abstract": "Photons play essential roles in fundamental physics and practical technologies. They have become one of the attractive informaiton carriers for quantum computation and quantum simulation. Recently, various photonic degrees of freedom supported by optical resonant cavities form photonic synthetic dimensions, which contribute to all-optical platforms for simulating novel topological materials. The photonic discrete or continuous degrees of freedom are mapped to the lattices or momenta of the simulated topological matter, and the couplings between optical modes are equivalent to the interactions among quasi-particles. Mature optical modulations enable flexible engineering of the simulated Hamiltonian. Meanwhile, the resonant detection methods provide direct approaches to obtaining the corresponding energy band structures, particle distributions and dynamical evolutions. In this Review, we give an overview of the synthetic dimensions in optical cavities, including frequency, orbital angular momentum, time-multiplexed lattice, and independent parameters. Abundant higher-dimensional topological models have been demonstrated in lower dimensional synthetic systems. We further discuss the potential development of photonic synthetic dimensions in the future. ",

The approximate solution is derived from an exact linearization of the electromagnetic 5-moment fluid equations, and writing down the integral form of the driven steady-state solution, which is expressed as a sum over modal contributions associated with the eigenvectors/eigenvalues of the set of equations. We find the eigenvectors/eigenvalues numerically and use them to argue that only two of the modes are capable of transmitting energy through the ionosphere. Approximating their integrands with analytic functions yields a solution valid for homogeneous plasma, expressed in terms of the eigenvectors/eigenvalues for the two modes. The solution may be understood using wavepacket concepts. Transmission line theory is then used to extend the homogeneous-plasma solution to a solution for the vertically-stratified ionosphere. We review how transmission line theory contains electrostatic theory as a special case, and show that our solution reproduces electrostatic theory exactly when the eigenvectors/eigenvalues have the right properties, which requires that they be artificially modified. Otherwise we find short-wavelength, mode-mixing, and wave-admittance effects with broad relevance to ionospheric science, and to global modeling of the Sun-Earth system. Since resonant systems can be very sensitive, quantitative accuracy may require tuning, but the physical conclusions seem unavoidable and to affect all transverse scales. ",

    "abstract": "Paradoxically, imaging with resolution much below the wavelength $\\lambda$ - now common place in the visible spectrum - remains challenging at lower frequencies, where arguably it is needed most due to the large wavelengths used. Techniques to break the diffraction limit in microscopy have led to many breakthroughs across sciences, but remain largely confined to the optical spectrum, where near-field coupled fluorophores operate. At lower frequencies, exponentially decaying evanescent waves must be measured directly, requiring a tip or antenna to be brought into very close vicinity to the object. This is often difficult, and can be problematic as the probe can perturb the near-field distribution itself. Here we show the information encoded in evanescent waves can be probed further than previously thought possible, and a truthful image of the near-field reconstructed through selective amplification of evanescent waves - akin to a virtual superlens reversing the evanescent decay. We quantify the trade-off between noise and measurement distance, and experimentally demonstrate reconstruction of complex images with subwavelength features, down to a resolution of $\\lambda/7$ and amplitude signal-to-noise ratios below 25dB between 0.18-1.5THz. Our procedure can be implemented with any near field probe far from the reactive near field region, greatly relaxes experimental requirements for subwavelength imaging in particular at sub-optical frequencies, and opens the door to non-perturbing near-field scanning.

    "abstract": "The degenerate case of normal incidence and reflection of an optical beam (both paraxial and non-paraxial) at a plane isotropic dielectric interface, which is azimuthally symmetric in terms of the momentum-spatial variation of Fresnel coefficients but not in terms of the fundamental polarization inhomogeneity of the incident field, requires in-depth analyses. In this paper, we use the reflection and transmission coefficient matrix formalism to derive an exact field expression of a normal-reflected diverging beam. The availability of the exact field information allows controlled variations of the system parameters, leading to significant dynamics of phase and polarization singularities hitherto unanticipated in the literature. We carry out a detailed exploration of these dynamics in our simulated system, and also verify them experimentally by using an appropriate setup. We then use Barnett's formalism to determine the associated orbital angular momentum (OAM) fluxes, leading to a subtle interpretation and mathematical characterization of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in the system. Our work thus represents a non-trivial unification of the most fundamental electromagnetic reflection/transmission problem at a plane dielectric interface and the emerging areas of optical singularity dynamics with their understanding in terms of OAM flux and SOI. The normal-incidence--retro-reflection geometry being especially amenable to applications, these beam-field phenomena are anticipated to have applications in interface characterization, particle rotation/manipulation and other nano-optical processes.

    "abstract": "Despite the detection of numerous interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) for decades, it is still a matter of debate whether they are synthesized in the gas-phase or on the icy surface of interstellar grains. In the past, molecular deuteration has been used to constrain the formation paths of small and abundant hydrogenated interstellar species. More recently, the deuteration degree of formamide, one of the most interesting iCOM, has also been explained in the hypothesis that it is formed by the gas-phase reaction NH$_2$ + H$_2$CO. In this article, we aim at using molecular deuteration to constrain the formation of another iCOM, glycolaldehyde, which is an important prebiotic species. More specifically, we have performed dedicated electronic structure and kinetic calculations to establish the glycolaldehyde deuteration degree in relation to that of ethanol, which is its possible parent species according to the suggestion of Skouteris et al. (2018). We found that the abundance ratio of the species containing one D-atom over the all-protium counterpart depends on the produced D isotopomer and varies from 0.9 to 0.5. These theoretical predictions compare extremely well with the monodeuterated isotopomers of glycolaldehyde and that of ethanol measured towards the Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422, supporting the hypothesis that glycolaldehyde could be produced in the gas-phase for this source. In addition, the present work confirms that the deuterium fractionation of iCOMs cannot be simply anticipated based on the deuterium fractionation of the parent species but necessitates a specific study, as already shown for the case of formamide.

In this work I examine diverse methods of optical isolation via temporal modulation and show that independent on whether modulation is achieved by carrier injection, Pockels and acousto-optic effects, or any other conceivable method, there is essentially the same set of constraints on footprint, modulation frequency, and, most important, on power consumption required to achieve full isolation without excessive insertion loss. This power is estimated to be on the order of at least a hundred of milliwatts and whether this requirement is acceptable will depend on ongoing progress of both magneto-optic and time modulated integrated technologies.

    "abstract": "Constructing a quantum computer requires immensely precise control over a quantum system. A lack of precision is often quantified by gate-error metrics, such as the average infidelity or the diamond distance. However, usually such gate-error metrics are only considered for individual gates, and not the errors that accumulate over consecutive gates. Furthermore, it is not well known how susceptible the metrics are to the assumptions which make up the model. Here, we investigate these issues using realistic simulation models of quantum computers with flux-tunable transmons and coupling resonators. We show that the gate-error metrics are susceptible to many of the assumptions which make up the model. Additionally, we find that consecutive gate errors do not accumulate linearly. Previous work showed that the gate-error metrics are poor predictors for the performance of consecutive gates. Here, we provide further evidence and a concise theoretical explanation for this finding. Furthermore, we discuss a problem that potentially limits the overall scaling capabilities of the device architecture we study in this work. ",
