    "title": "Thermo-mechanical behaviour of a tungsten first wall in HiPER laser  fusion scenarios",
    "abstract": "The behaviour of a tungsten first wall is studied under the irradiation conditions predicted for the different operation scenarios of the European Laser fusion project HiPER, which is based on direct drive targets and an evacuated dry wall chamber. The scenarios correspond to different stages in the development of a nuclear fusion reactor, from proof of principle (bunch mode facility) to economic feasibility (pre-commercial power plant). This work constitutes a quantitative study to evaluate the first wall performance under realistic irradiation conditions in the different scenarios. We calculated the radiation fluxes assuming the geometrical configurations reported so far for HiPER. Then, we calculated the irradiation-induced first wall temperature evolution and the thermo-mechanical response of the material. The results indicate that the first wall will plastically deform up to a few microns underneath the surface. Continuous operation in power plant leads to fatigue failure with crack generation and growth. Finally, the crack propagation and the minimum W thickness required to fulfil the first wall protection role is studied. The response of tungsten as first wall material as well as its main limitations will be discussed for the HiPER scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "The European HiPER project aims to demonstrate commercial viability of inertial fusion energy within the following two decades. This goal requires an extensive Research & Development program on materials for different applications (e.g., first wall, structural components and final optics). In this paper we will discuss our activities in the framework of HiPER to develop materials studies for the different areas of interest. The chamber first wall will have to withstand explosions of at least 100 MJ at a repetition rate of 5-10 Hz. If direct drive targets are used, a dry wall chamber operated in vacuum is preferable. In this situation the major threat for the wall stems from ions. For reasonably low chamber radius (5-10 m) new materials based on W and C are being investigated, e.g., engineered surfaces and nanostructured materials. Structural materials will be subject to high fluxes of neutrons leading to deleterious effects, such as, swelling. Low activation advanced steels as well as new nanostructured materials are being investigated. The final optics lenses will not survive the extreme ion irradiation pulses originated in the explosions. Therefore, mitigation strategies are being investigated. In addition, efforts are being carried out in understanding optimized conditions to minimize the loss of optical properties by neutron and gamma irradiation. ",

    "abstract": "Sound reconstruction via arbitrary objects has been a popular method in recent years, based on the recording of scattered light from the target object with a high-speed detector. In this work, we demonstrate the use of multi-mode fiber as a medium that enables reconstruction at a much further distance. By placing a speaker near the fiber and using a high-speed camera with a maximum region of interest, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the sound without relying on specific grain information in the speckle. Basic filtration techniques and spectral subtraction methods are employed to improve the signal quality. After applying band-stop and high-pass filters, the magnitude-squared coherence between the original sound and captured data is 0.8 at fundamental frequencies. The proof-of-concept method that we introduce here can be extended to monitor the vibrations of earth's crust and civilian buildings for structural safety. ",

Besides its natural abundance, silicon has desirable properties such as optically low loss (at certain critical wavelengths), and small form factor to enable high density scaled-up optical on-chip circuitry. However, given its indirect bandgap, the platform is typically integrated with other direct bandgap (e.g., III-V semiconductor) platforms for on-chip light source. An effective solution to integrating light source onto silicon photonics platform is integral to a practical scaled-up and full-fledged integrated photonics implementation. Here, we discuss the integration solutions, and present our foundry's perspective toward realizing it. ",

When the electric field strength inside vacuum is below $0.6$ V/\\AA, an intra-band mechanism associated to non-adiabatic response of multiple valence and conduction bands is found to be responsible for high-harmonic generation in the bulk solid. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized perpendicular to the optical axis of the crystal.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the acousto-optic modulation of a hybrid-lattice hollow core fiber (HL-HCF) for the first time. For many years, optical fibers with reduced diameters have been the main solution to increase the interaction of acoustic and optical waves. However, the high drive voltages and large modulator components still employed drastically affect the efficiency and miniaturization of these devices. Here, we experimentally show that combining Kagom\\'e and tubular lattices in HL-HCFs allows for enhancing the amplification of the acoustic waves and the modulation of the guided optical modes thus providing high modulation efficiency even when using a fiber with a 240 um diameter. To the best of our knowledge, the measured HL-HCF's modulation efficiency (1.3 dB/V) is the highest compared to devices employing reduced diameter fibers. Additionally, we demonstrate a compact acousto-optic modulator with driver dimensions smaller than the HL-HCF diameter. Overall, our results show a promising alternative to solve the compromise of speed, efficiency, and compactness for integration with microscale all-fiber photonic devices. ",

Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies.

We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems. ",

    "abstract": "Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising quantum information platforms but are susceptible to magnetic noise. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near nanostructured lossy material components essential in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum sensing and computing, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise for enhancing spin qubit quantum sensing and computing performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. We further apply our theoretical framework to control noise effects in realistic quantum computing devices and quantum sensing applications. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing. ",

Furthermore, we analyze the performance of a quantum algorithm designed for optimization, which runs with various quantum simulators on a local computer or HPC-quantum system. Results showcase ~24 times speedup when executing the optimization algorithm on the HPC-quantum hybrid system.
