    "abstract": "We set a generalised non-linear Lagrangian, encompassing Born-Infeld and Heisenberg-Euler theories among others. The Lagrangian reduces to the Maxwell Lagrangian at lowest order. The field is composed by a propagating light-wave in an electro-magnetic background. The wave exhibits energy variation when the background is space-time dependent. In the photon description, this implies a red or a blue shift, like what we obtained in massive theories, as the de Broglie-Proca or effective mass theories as the Standard-Model Extension under Lorentz symmetry violation. The two results, photon energy-conservation and the frequency shift are instead new for non-linear electro-magnetism. We conclude by discussing how these static frequency shifts when added to the expansion red shift allow new interpretations in cosmology or for atomic spectra. We finally consider the consequences on the Poincar\\'e symmetry. ",

    "title": "Improved pressure-gradient sensor for the prediction of separation onset  in RANS models",
    "abstract": "We improve upon two key aspects of the Menter shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model: (1) We propose a more robust adverse pressure gradient sensor based on the strength of the pressure gradient in the direction of the local mean flow; (2) We propose two alternative eddy viscosity models to be used in the adverse pressure gradient regions identified by our sensor. Direct numerical simulations of the Boeing Gaussian bump are used to identify the terms in the baseline SST model that need correction, and a posteriori Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes calculations are used to calibrate coefficient values, leading to a model that is both physics driven and data informed. The two sensor-equipped models are applied to two thick airfoils representative of modern wind turbine applications, the FFA-W3-301 and the DU00-W-212, with maximum thicknesses of 30% and 20% of their chord lengths, respectively. While the baseline SST model predicts stall (onset of separation) $3^\\circ$ to $5^\\circ$ late for all cases considered, the proposed models predict stall within the margins of experimental uncertainty, which greatly improves the prediction of the maximum lift generated. For the FFA airfoil, the models also improve the prediction of the linear region of the lift curve likely due to their improved prediction of a pressure-side separation at low angles of attack. The models are shown to generalize well across the two airfoil geometries (despite their difference in thickness) and across almost a factor of 10 in variations in chord-based Reynolds numbers from $1.6\\times10^6$ to $1.5\\times10^7$.

    "abstract": "Optical refrigeration of solids with anti-Stokes fluorescence has been widely explored as a vibration-free cryogenic cooling technology. A minimum temperature of 87 K has been demonstrated with rare-earth ion doped crystals using optical refrigeration. However, the depletion of the upper-lying energy levels in the ground state manifold hinders further cooling to below liquid nitrogen (LN$_2$) temperatures, confining its applications. In this work, we introduce a Purcell enhanced optical refrigeration method to circumvent this limitation. This approach enhances the emission of high energy photons by coupling to a nearby nanocavity, blue shifting the mean emission wavelength. Such Purcell enhanced emission facilitates cooling starting from a lower energy level in the ground state manifold, which exhibits a higher occupation below LN$_2$ temperatures. Using our experimentally measured optical coefficients, our theoretical analysis predicts a minimum achievable temperature of 38 K for a Yb$^{3+}$:YLiF$_{4}$ nanocrystal near a cavity under realistic conditions. The proposed method is applicable to other rare-earth ion doped materials and semiconductors, and will have applications in creating superconducting and other quantum devices with solid-state cooling.

    "abstract": "In recent years, a new kind of accelerated hardware has gained popularity in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities which enables extremely high-performance tensor contractions in reduced precision for deep neural network calculations. In this article, we exploit Nvidia Tensor cores, a prototypical example of such AI/ML hardware, to develop a mixed precision approach for computing a dense matrix factorization of the inverse overlap matrix in electronic structure theory, $S^{-1}$. This factorization of $S^{-1}$, written as $ZZ^T=S^{-1}$, is used to transform the general matrix eigenvalue problem into a standard matrix eigenvalue problem. Here we present a mixed precision iterative refinement algorithm where $Z$ is given recursively using matrix-matrix multiplications and can be computed with high performance on Tensor cores. To understand the performance and accuracy of Tensor cores, comparisons are made to GPU-only implementations in single and double precision. Additionally, we propose a non-parametric stopping criteria which is robust in the face of lower precision floating point operations. The algorithm is particularly useful when we have a good initial guess to $Z$, for example, from previous time steps in quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations or from a previous iteration in a geometry optimization.

We derive analytical solutions for the time-dependent polarizations and magnetizations for the second-order response to the electric field component of an ultrashort laser pulse. These allow us to define second-order nonlinear electric and magneto-electric susceptibilities that capture the rectification, as well as the impulsive and sum-frequency excitation of coherent phonons and magnons. Our theoretical framework naturally incorporates existing mechanisms and further leads to the prediction of a hybrid magneto-opto-phononic inverse Faraday effect involving photon-phonon-magnon scattering.

By analyzing the asymptotic time response of the system, the theory demonstrates that the Alfv\\'en resonance is due to the residues at the resonant poles, in the complex frequency plane, introduced by the boundary perturbation. Alfv\\'en resonance transitions towards forced reconnection, described by the constant-psi regime for (normalized) times $t\\gg S^{1/3}$, when the forcing frequency of the boundary perturbation is $\\omega_0\\ll S^{-1/3}$, allowing the coupling of the Alfv\\'en resonances across the neutral line with the reconnecting mode, as originally suggested in [1].

To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. In this work, an inverse modeling approach is used to calibrate the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in the Multiple-Size-Group (MUSIG) population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration aims at replicating experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. The estimated simulation bias also allows identifying the best-performing closure models irrespective of the model parameters used. The calibration results suggest that the breakage rate is underestimated by one order of magnitude in two different breakup modeling approaches. ",

    "abstract": "AI is revolutionizing MRI along the acquisition and processing chain. Advanced AI frameworks have been developed to apply AI in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. Existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently or are focused on specific models or datasets, limiting generalization. We introduce ATOMMIC, an open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using DL networks and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks integrated, targeting generalization in the MRI domain. We first review the current state of AI frameworks for MRI through a comprehensive literature search and by parsing 12,479 GitHub repositories. We benchmark 25 DL models on eight publicly available datasets to present distinct applications of ATOMMIC on accelerated MRI reconstruction, image segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and image segmentation utilizing MTL. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC is the only MTL framework with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support. Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which enforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI, outperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. Physics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately estimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction models are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL, performance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction and analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability, integrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models. ",

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms. ",

We deploy nanodiamond particles hosting fluorescent nitrogen vacancy defects as quantum sensors in flowing, monodisperse, picoliter-volume microdroplets containing analyte molecules. ND motion within these microcompartments facilitates close sensor-analyte interaction and mitigates particle heterogeneity. Microdroplet flow rates are rapid (upto 4cm/s) and with minimal drift. Pairing this controlled flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, we introduce a new noise-suppressed mode of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance that is sensitive to chemical analytes while resilient against experimental variations, achieving detection of analyte-induced signals at an unprecedented level of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. We demonstrate its application to detecting paramagnetic ions in droplets with simultaneously low limit-of-detection and low analyte volumes, in a manner significantly better than existing technologies. This is combined with exceptional measurement stability over >103s and across hundreds of thousands of droplets, while utilizing minimal sensor volumes and incurring low ND costs (<$0.70 for an hour of operation). Additionally, we demonstrate using these droplets as micro-confinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with analytes, including single cells. This versatility suggests wide-ranging applications, like single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements in bioreactors.

Here we consider the Tavis-Cummings model, a solvable system of two-levels atoms, coupled with a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field. This system undergoes a superradiant phase transition, even in a finite-size framework, accompanied by a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and an infinite sequence of energy level crossings. We find approximated expressions for the ground state, its energy, and the position of the level crossings, valid in the limit of a very large number of photons with respect to that of the atoms. In that same limit, we find that the number of photons scales quadratically with the coupling strength, and linearly with the system size, providing a new insight into the superradiance phenomenon. Resorting to novel multipartite measures, we then demonstrate that this quantum phase transition is accompanied by a crossover in the quantum correlations and entanglement between the atoms (qubits). The latters therefore represent suited order parameters for this transition. Finally, we show that these properties of the quantum phase transition persist in the thermodynamic limit. ",

    "title": "Programmable activation of quantum emitters in high-purity silicon with  focused carbon ion beams",
    "abstract": "Carbon implantation at the nanoscale is highly desired for the engineering of defect-based qubits in a variety of materials, including silicon, diamond, SiC and hBN. However, the lack of focused carbon ion beams does not allow for the full disclosure of their potential for application in quantum technologies. Here, we develop and use a carbon source for focused ion beams for the simultaneous creation of two types of quantum emitters in silicon, the W and G centers. Furthermore, we apply a multi-step implantation protocol for the programmable activation of the G centers with sub-100- nm resolution. This approach provides a route for significant enhancement of the creation yield of single G centers in carbon-free silicon wafers. Our experimental demonstration is an important step towards nanoscale engineering of telecom quantum emitters in silicon of high crystalline quality and isotope purity. ",
