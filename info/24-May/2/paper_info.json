    "abstract": "The rapid growth of quantum technologies requires an increasing number of physicists, computer scientists, and engineers who can work on these technologies. For educating these professionals, quantum mechanics should stop being perceived as incomprehensible. In this paper we contribute to this change by presenting a pedagogical model for explaining Grover's search algorithm, a prominent quantum algorithm. This model visualizes the three main steps of Grover's algorithm and, in addition to explaining the algorithm itself, introduces three key principles of quantum mechanics: superposition, interference, and state collapse at measurement. The pedagogical model, visualized by a video, is called the \"Ant Colony Maze model\". It represents the search problems as finding the exit of a maze, and visualizes Grover's search algorithm as a strategy by which a colony of ants finds that exit. ",

    "abstract": "Nonreciprocity, which denotes the asymmetric or even unidirectional transmission of light, constitutes the cornerstone of modern photonic circuits. In the realm of photonic devices, it has been widely utilized in isolators, circulators and so on. Recent topology in artificial materials, an unprecedented degree of freedom, has been proposed to solve the effect of impurities on nonreciprocal transmission. However, in view of the bulk-edge correspondence, the spatial width of the transmission channel with uniform field distribution is quite narrow and needs further exploration. In this paper, we proposed a one-way valley-locked waveguide with a large channel in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. Quite different from the topological edge modes, the unidirectional property of our waveguide comes from the bulk modes with valley-lock, which can fully utilize the whole dimension of the structure with an efficiency of 100%. Additionally, the electrical field is uniformly distributed across the entire channel, which opens a new avenue for low-loss nonreciprocity devices. ",

    "abstract": "Transferring energy without transferring mass is a powerful paradigm to address the challenges faced when the access to, or the deployment of, the infrastructure for energy conversion is locally impossible or impractical. Laser beaming holds the promise of effectively implementing this paradigm. With this perspective, this work evaluates the optical-to-electrical power conversion that is created when a collimated laser beam illuminates a silicon photovoltaic solar cell that is located kilometers away from the laser. The laser is a CW high-energy Yb-doped fiber laser emitting at a center wavelength of 1075 nm with ~1 m2 of effective beam area. For 20 kW illumination of a solar panel having 0.6 m2 of area, optical simulations and thermal simulations indicate electrical output power of 3000 Watts at a panel temperature of 550 K. Our investigations show that thermo-radiative cells are rather inefficient. In contrast, an optimized approach to harvest laser energy is achieved by using a hybrid module consisting of a photovoltaic cell and a thermo-electric generator. Finally, practical considerations related to infrared power beaming are discussed and its potential applications are outlined. ",

    "abstract": "The miniaturisation of optical systems is an ongoing challenge across the electromagnetic spectrum. While the thickness of optical elements themselves can be reduced using advances in metamaterials, it is the voids between these elements -- which are necessary parts of an optical system -- that occupy most of the volume. Recently, a novel optical element coined a `spaceplate' was proposed, that replaces a region of free space with a thinner optical element that emulates the free-space optical response function -- thus having the potential to substantially shrink the volume of optical systems. While there have been a few proof-of-principle demonstrations of spaceplates, they have not yet been deployed in a real-world optical system. In this work, we use a bespoke-designed spaceplate to reduce the length of a gradient index (GRIN) lens microwave antenna. Our antenna is designed to operate at 23.5 GHz, and the incorporation of a nonlocal metamaterial spaceplate enables the distance between the antenna feed and the GRIN lens to be reduced by almost a factor of two. We find the radiation patterns from a conventional and space-squeezed antenna are very similar, with a very low cross-polarisation, and only a minor increase in the side-lobe levels when introducing the spaceplate. Our work represents a first example of a spaceplate integrated into a functional optical system, highlighting the potential for this concept to reduce the physical size of optical systems in real-world applications.

This work comprehensively reviews the seminal works that explored the overlap between quantum theory and accounting.

The system of two identical vortices also has orbital angular momentum and behaves, at distances much greater than the distance between the axes of the vortices, as a single vortex. With the help of Maxwell's hydrodynamic equations for the vortex we deduced the force between two vortices and obtained the expression of the equivalent mass of the vortex and the permittivity of the electroacoustic field. We also obtained and interpreted the expression for the energy density of the acoustic field. The density and pressure variations induced by the vortex cause the change in the propagation speed of the acoustic waves and the acoustic lensing property of the vortex. ",

The optimization of the device structure requires a quantitative understanding of energy conversion and loss mechanisms. Stroboscopic full-field diffraction x-ray microscopy studies of a prototypical one-port resonator device revealed the existence of unanticipated acoustic loss. A non-uniform acoustic excitation in the active area was responsible for the substantial end and side leakages observed at the design frequency. Quantitative analysis of the strain amplitude using a wave decomposition method allowed the determination of several key device parameters. This high-resolution spatiotemporal strain imaging technique is, more generally, suited for studying nanophononics, specifically when the feature size is smaller than optical wavelengths. The strain sensitivity allows precise measurement of acoustic waves with picometer-scale amplitude. ",

    "abstract": "To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity. ",

Starting from the Thomson inverse scattering, where electrons do not recoil and photons are back-scattered to higher energies by a Lorentz boost effect (factor $4\\gamma^2$), we analyze three transition points, separating four regions. These are in sequence, given by increasing the electron recoil (numbers are for transition points, letters for regions): a) Thomson back-scattering, 1) equal sharing of total energy in the exit channel between electron and photon, b) deep recoil regime where the bandwidth/energy spread of the two interacting beams are exchanged in the exit channel, 2) electron is stopped, i.e. taken down at rest in the laboratory system by colliding with an incident photon of $mc^2/2$ energy, c) electron back-scattering region, where incident electron is back-scattered by the incident photon, 3) symmetric scattering, when the incident particles carry equal and opposite momenta, so that in the exit channel they are back-scattered with same energy/momenta, d) Compton scattering ($a'$ $la$ Arthur Compton, see ref.4), where photons carry an energy much larger than the colliding electron energy. For each region and/or transition point we discuss the potential effects of interest in diverse areas, like generating mono-chromatic gamma ray beams in deep recoil regions with spectral purification, or possible mechanisms of generation and propagation of very high energy photons in the cosmological domain.

We calculate the quantum rates using the numerically exact multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, as well as the approximate ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), ring-polymer instanton (RPI) methods, and classical mechanics. By conducting simulations across a wide range of temperatures and friction strengths, we can identify the various regimes that govern the reactive dynamics. At high temperatures, in addition to the spatial-diffusion and energy-diffusion regimes predicted by Kramer's rate theory, a (coherent) tunnelling-dominated regime is identified at low friction. At low temperatures, incoherent tunnelling dominates most of Kramer's curve, except at very low friction when coherent tunnelling becomes dominant. Unlike in classical mechanics, the bath's influence changes the equilibrium time-independent properties of the system, leading to a complex interplay between spatially dependent friction and nuclear quantum effects even at high temperatures. More specifically, we show that a realistic friction profile can lead to an increase (decrease) of the quantum (classical) rates with friction within the spatial-diffusion regime, showing that classical and quantum rates display qualitatively different behaviours. Except at very low frictions, we find that RPMD captures most of the quantum effects in the thermal reaction rates. ",

However, generalization to mixed states leads to a technical challenge that is formidable to overcome directly. In this work, we avoid such technicality by unveiling the physics of a featured lossless post-selection measurement: while the post-selected quantum state is unchanged, the parametric derivative of the density operator is amplified by a large factor equal to the square root of the inverse of the post-selection success probability. This observation not only clarifies the intuition and essence of post-selected quantum metrology but also allows us to develop a mathematically compact theory for the lossless post-selection of mixed states. We find that if the parametric derivative of the density operator of a mixed state, or alternatively the symmetric logarithmic derivative, vanishes on the support of the density matrix, lossless post-selection can be achieved with an arbitrarily large amplification factor. We exemplify with the examples of superresolution imaging and unitary encoding of mixed initial states. Our results are useful for realistic post-selected quantum metrology in the presence of decoherence and of foundational interests to several problems in quantum information theory. ",

Ground-state VMC and DMC energies are obtained in the density range $1 \\leq r_\\text{s} \\leq 40$. Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are corrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and extrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC energies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are discussed. We find that, for $1 \\leq r_\\text{s} \\leq 5$, optimizing the backflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite system size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the DMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple finite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic effects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at different system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic limit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation functional for inhomogeneous electron systems.
