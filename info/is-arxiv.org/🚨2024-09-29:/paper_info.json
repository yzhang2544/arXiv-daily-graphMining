    "abstract": "           Vortex-based single-beam tweezers have the ability to precisely and selectively move a wide range of objects, including particles, bubbles, droplets, and cells with sizes ranging from the millimeter to micrometer scale. In 2017, Karlsen and Bruus [Phys. Rev. Appl. 7, 034017 (2017)] theoretically suggested that these tweezers could also address one of the most challenging issues: the patterning and manipulation of miscible fluids. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate this ability using acoustic vortex beams generated by interdigital transducer-based active holograms. The experimental results are supported by a numerical model based on acoustic body force simulations. This work paves the way for the precise shaping of chemical concentration fields, a crucial factor in numerous chemical and biological processes.         ",

Initial tests were conducted on the production ASIC, after evaluating the performance of the preproduction one.

Our approach uses multimode fiber-coupled laser illumination to generate high-contrast speckle patterns, requiring only two images for optical property estimation. We demonstrate 3D profilometry using active stereo from low-coherence RGB laser flood illumination, which corrects for measured intensity variations caused by object height and surface angle differences. Validation against conventional SFDI in phantoms and an in-vivo human finger study showed good agreement, with profile-correction improving accuracy for complex geometries.

However, the weak magnetic detecting still face some problems, including the large size of the detectors and the limited detection scale. To contribute to the detection of weak magnetic fields, the Co-CsPbBr3 colloidal quantum dots (QDs) composite magnetic material was synthesised on the basis of the theory of room temperature ferromagnetism, molecular polarisation and vibration level of chemical bond. The synthesis involved the mixing of Co2+ into CsPbBr3, an all-inorganic perovskite with activated ions. Subsequently, a weak magnetic field measurement system was devised, comprising working medium samples and a vibration level detection optical path. Following the acquisition, comparison, processing and analysis of multiple data sets, a Stokes displacement function model was established under different magnetic field sizes and the weak magnetic field intensity range of Pitsla (pT) was measured. The Pitsla weak magnetic field measurement system proposed in this paper provides a reference for the development of non-contact weak magnetic measurement methods and for the advancement of intelligent and low-dimensional weak signal measurement applications.

    "abstract": "           A comparative analysis of two types of dielectric laser accelerators (DLA) based on periodic (grating) and flat dielectric structures to accelerate electrons in the energy range from 300 keV to 3 GeV is presented. The main attention is paid to the conditions, efficiency and restrictions of each acceleration method, as well as the influence of laser radiation parameters on electron acceleration processes. Single and double (both grating and flat) dielectric structures and their impact on acceleration are considered. For the study of two types of quartz DLA, the Ti:Sa laser system with a generation band width 790-810 nm (FWHM), the laser electric field 6 GeV/m are used. The study showed that a flat dielectric structure provides more effective acceleration in a wide range of energies, especially with a symmetrical geometry (double structures), compared with the periodic structure. If we consider only a periodic structure, then with the selected symmetrical geometry, for the ultra relativistic electrons, it demonstrates the acceleration rate two times of magnitude more than for single configuration. However, the use of a one-sided periodic structure turns out to be preferable for accelerating electrons with moderate energies, ~0.5-0.9 MeV, where the acceleration rate in a one-sided configuration is higher than in a symmetric (double) periodic structure. The space-time distributions of laser-excited electromagnetic fields in the accelerating channel and their influence on the electron beam is analyzed also. The advantage of a flat structure over a periodic one, which arises due to the design features of the corresponding dielectric accelerators, is discussed.         ",

    "abstract": "           Orbital angular momentum (OAM) light beams for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) provide an additional degree of freedom to study the light-matter interaction at ultrafast timescales. A more sophisticated configuration is a perfect optical vortex (POV) beam, a light beam with a helical wavefront characterized by a phase singularity at its center and an azimuthal phase variation. POV beams are characterized by a radial profile which is independent of the OAM. Here we study the non-perturbative process of gas-phase HHG using a linearly polarized POV beam. We observe that the harmonics are emitted with similar divergence due the perfectness of the POV-driven harmonics. Furthermore, the topological charge upscaling is rigorously followed. We show that a POV beam is more advantageous than that of the Laguerre-Gaussian beam for cases where a large topological charge with a small core size is required. Our research establishes a pathway for producing bright structured extreme ultraviolet (XUV) coherent radiation sources--a pivotal tool with multifaceted applications across various technological domains.

    "abstract": "           Recently, a photonic alloy with non-trivial topological properties has been proposed, based on the random mixing of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) and magnetized YIG rods. When the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods is less than one, a chiral edge state (CES) of the topological photonic alloy appears in the frequency range of the non-trivial topological gap of the magnetized YIG crystal. In this work, we surprisingly find that by randomly mixing the Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) and magnetized YIG rods in a square lattice, the photonic alloy system with appropriate doping concentrations can present CES in special frequency intervals even when both components support the propagation of bulk states. Analyzing the band structure of two components, we noticed a shift between the first trivial bandgap for PEC and the first topological bandgap for magnetized YIG. When calculating the transmission spectrum of the photonic alloy, we discovered that the frequency range for the topological gap gradually opens from the lower limit frequency of the bandgap for PEC to the bandgap for the magnetized YIG rods. The topological gap opening occurs as the doping concentration of magnetized YIG rods increases, creating an effective band alignment effect. Moreover, the topological gap for the photonic alloy is confirmed by calculating the reflection phase winding with the scattering method. Lastly, the gradual appearance of the CES is identified by applying Fourier transformation to real-space electromagnetic fields. Our work broadens the possibilities for flexible topological gap engineering in the photonic alloy system.         ",

    "abstract": "           Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), i.e., the localization of eigenstates near lattice boundaries, has recently spurred tremendous interest in topological physics. Beyond the well-explored linear NHSE, the interplay of nonlinearity and skin localization represents a cutting-edge area of research, offering novel insights into wave propagation and localization control in various physical systems. Unlike the linear NHSE successfully observed in weak-power optical systems, the observation of nonlinear NHSE and resulting skin solitons remains so far elusive, mainly due to the high energy levels required in most of nonlinear effects. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nonlinear NHSE in a Kerr nonlinear temporal photonic lattice, where the high-power limitation and lack of tunability intrinsic to optical materials are overcome by an artificial nonlinearity arising from opto-electronic feedback. Thanks to Kerr self-trapping, the nonlinear NHSE is demonstrated to possess much better localization strength and robustness at the preferred boundary compared to the linear case. Away from the preferred boundary, Kerr self-trapping can even inhibit NHSE-induced transport and form stable skin solitons. Harnessing the nonlinearity-controlled NHSE, we judiciously design an optical router with a flexibly-tuned output port. Our findings promise great applications in robust signal transmission, routing, and processing.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report on measurements and modeling studies performed from 2021 to 2024 on the 76 sextupole magnets in the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring CESR. Beam-based, magnet-specific calibrations ($K_2$ value versus excitation current) were measured. It was found that the new calibrations differ from those previously in use by an average of 3.1% with an RMS spread of 12%. The uncertainties in the calibration correction factors average 1.7% with an RMS spread of 1.0%. Sextupole alignment values relative to the reference orbit were measured by combining the measured beam position with the quadrupole and skew quadrupole terms caused by a sextupole strength change $\\Delta K_2$. High accuracy was achieved by fitting to difference phase and coupling functions as $K_2$ was varied. The horizontal (vertical) average offset values were found to be -0.01 (0.03)~mm with RMS spread of 1.1 (0.9)~mm with some exceptionally large values of a few millimeters. Typical uncertainties are 0.01-0.02~mm. The above measurements were motivated by the precision required in measuring horizontal beam size at each sextupole. A precision of 10\\% for a \\mbox{1-mm} beam size requires uncertainties of better than 0.1~$\\mu$radian in the horizontal angle change produced in the sextupole for a typical strength change of \\mbox{$\\Delta K_2 \\, L$ = 1 m$^{-2}$}, where $L$ is the length of the sextupole, as well as 10\\% in the difference of the squared horizontal and vertical beam positions relative to the center of the sextupole. These precision values were achieved by the analysis of difference functions. However, a small source of horizontal angle change of unknown origin, independent of the sextupole strength, requires a sextupole strength range larger than now available to measure accurately the typical horizontal beam size at CESR.

LFI has been realized in many types of lasers but has never been reported in non-planar ring oscillators (NPRO) to the best of our knowledge. In this letter, we present a new type of LFI based on an NPRO laser. The intrinsic resistance to optical feedback in NPROs is broken under weak-magnetic-intensity condition, where stable bidirectional lasing is initiated in the ring cavity. The interference signal, i.e., the beat of the bidirectional lasing is with frequency from a few hundred of kilohertz to a few megahertz which is mainly determined by the applied magnetic intensity in NPRO. Frequency-shifted LFI is thus constructed in NPRO without using acousto-optic modulators as mostly used in conventional LFI. A theoretical model is established to well describe the phenomenon. In the end, micro-vibrational measurements are demonstrated to prove the potential application, where vibration-detection amplitude limit below 30 pm, vibration-detection frequency range from a few kilohertz to a few hundred kilohertz is achieved. Benefiting from the characteristics of tiny footprint, ruggedized structure, long lifetime and ultralow-noise of NPRO lasers, NPRO-based LFI may find important applications in industry, scientific research, military and aerospace.

Currently, several approaches exist for compensating nonlinear distortions, but for practical implementation, algorithms must be simultaneously accurate, fast, and robust against various interferences. One established approach involves applying perturbation theory methods to the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which enables the determination of the relation between transmitted and received symbols. In most studies, gradient methods are used to find perturbation coefficients by minimizing the mean squared error between symbols. However, the main parameter characterizing the quality of information transmission is the bit error rate. We propose a modification of the conventional perturbation-based approach for fiber nonlinearity compensation in the form of a two-stage scheme for calculating perturbation coefficients. In the first stage, the coefficients are computed using a convolutional neural network by minimizing the mean squared error. In the second stage, the obtained solution is used as an initial approximation for minimizing the bit error rate using the particle swarm optimization method. In numerical experiments, using the nonlinearity compensation algorithm based on the proposed scheme, we achieved a 0.8~dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio for a 16QAM 20$\\times$100 km link with a channel rate of 267~Gbit/s and demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the single-stage scheme. We estimated computational complexity of the algorithm and demonstrated the relation between its complexity and accuracy. Additionally, we developed a method for learning perturbation coefficients without relying on ideal symbols from the transmitter, instead using the received symbols after hard decision detection.

In this study, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells in the VSM was investigated, which exhibits a surprising phenomenon of EQE above 100%. In theory, non-infrared light incident into a solar cell can cause infrared emission. The VSM could trap the emitted infrared photons and lead to extra photoexcited carriers. The easy-to-reproduce VSM effect is thus explainable. The energy of emitted infrared photons is considered as the so-called dark energy. This study provides new clues and evidences to unravel the mystery of the surprising VSM effect.

The delayed self-coupled microlaser is operated in the excitable regime, where it regenerates incident pulses with a supra-threshold intensity -- resulting in a pulse train with inter-pulse period approximately given by the feedback delay time, in analogy with a self-coupled biological neuron. We report the experimental observation of vectorial breathers in polarization angle, manifesting themselves as a modulation of the linear polarized intensity components without significant modulation of the total intensity. Numerical analysis of a suitable model reveals that the observed polarization mode competition is a consequence of symmetry-breaking bifurcations induced by polarization anisotropy. Our model reproduces well the observed experimental results and predicts different regimes as a function of the polarization anisotropy parameters and the pump parameter. We believe that these findings are relevant for the fabrication of flexible sources of polarized pulses with controlled properties, as well as for neuroinspired on-chip computing applications, where the polarization may be used to encode or process information in novel ways.

The ilGAD sensors were produced by Micron Semiconductor Ltd with the goal to obtain good gain uniformity and maximise the fill-factor -- an issue present with standard small-pitch LGAD designs. We have conducted detailed performance evaluations using both X-ray calibrations and beam tests. An X-ray fluorescence setup has been used to obtain energy calibration and to identify the optimal operating settings of the new devices, whereas the extensive beam tests allowed for a detailed evaluation of the detector performance. The beam-tests were performed at the CERN SPS North Area H6 beamline, using a 120 GeV/c pion beam. The reference tracking and time-stamping is achieved by a Timepix3-based beam telescope setup. The results show a gain of around 5 with very good uniformity, measured across the whole gain area, as well as a hit time resolution down to 1.3 ns without correcting for the time-walk effects. Furthermore, it is shown that the gain opens the possibility of a good X-ray energy resolution down to 4.5 keV.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a method for a precise determination of magnetic anisotropy and anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical response of thin films of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. The method is based on measurements of a magneto-optical response for light close to the normal incidence on the sample with a fixed position. The measurement is performed for a set of orientations of an external magnetic field and a series of incident light linear polarizations beyond the standard s and p orientations. Based on the symmetry of the signal, we are able to separate the part of magneto-optical response that is even with respect to magnetization and, in turn, to exclude all non-magnetic contributions which come from imperfections of the experimental setup or from the sample itself. It is, therefore, possible to study the sample placed inside a cryostat: the polarization changes due to cryostat windows and possible strain-induced optical anisotropy of the sample are removed by the applied data processing. Thanks to this, we can perform measurements on low or elevated temperatures (from 15 to 800 K in our case), making it possible to study the behavior of magnetic materials in different magnetic phases and/or close to phase transitions. The applicability of this experimental technique was tested by measuring the low-temperature response of two samples of ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As with a different Mn content at several wavelengths, which enabled us to deduce the magnetic and quadratic magneto-optical anisotropies in this material. In particular, we observed that the anisotropy of quadratic magneto-optical coefficients in (Ga,Mn)As is much weaker than that reported previously for other magnetic material systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurately determining the origin of radio emissions is essential for numerous scientific experiments, particularly in radio astronomy. Conventional techniques, such as the use of antenna arrays encounter significant challenges, specially at very low frequencies, due to factors like the substantial size of the antennas and ionospheric interference. To address these challenges, we employ a space-based single-telescope that utilizes co-located antennas, complemented by goniopolarimetric techniques for precise source localization. This study explores a novel and elementary machine learning (ML) technique as a way to improve and estimate Direction of Arrival (DoA), leveraging a tri-axial antenna arrangement for radio source localization. Employing a simplistic emission and receiving antenna model, our study involves training an artificial neural network (ANN) using synthetic radio signals. These synthetic signals can originate from any location in the sky and cover an incoherent frequency range of 0.3 to 30 MHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 0 and 60 dB. Then, a large data set was generated to train the ANN model catering to the possible signal configurations and variations. After training, the developed ANN model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving loss levels in the training ($\\sim0.02$), validation ($\\sim0.23\\%$), and testing ($\\sim0.21\\%$) phases. The machine learning-based approach remarkably, exhibits substantially quicker inference times ($\\sim5$ ms) in contrast to analytically derived Direction of Arrival (DoA) methods, which typically range from 100 ms to a few seconds. This underscores its practicality for real-time applications in radio source localization, particularly in scenarios with limited number of sensors.         ",

We sharpen the bounds and use our inverse-design approach across a variety of cases, showing in each one that the inverse-designed QWs can closely approach the bounds.

In the Earth-Moon rotating frame, resonance orbits appear repetitive; however, the argument of periapsis shifts due to the third-body effects from lunar flybys. The extent of this shift is influenced by the Jacobi integral associated with the resonance orbit. To identify feasible resonance orbits and the optimal Jacobi integral, we map the argument of periapsis change against the Jacobi integral for each prospective orbit. This synchronization allows the spacecraft to remain within a confined region in space when observed from the Sun-Earth rotating frame. Finally, the article discusses the applications of these long-term Earth magnetosphere science orbits, including orbit-orientation reconfiguration (station keeping) and stability.         ",

To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an alternative route for the generation of phononic combs in polar molecules. Theoretically, we investigated the radiation and phononic spectra generated from CO molecule possessing relatively large permanent dipole moment with density matrix formalism. By considering rovibronic excitation of the ground-state CO molecule while avoiding the electronic excitation, the contribution of the permanent dipole moment and electric dipole polarizability to the creation of PFCs is demonstrated and distinguished.

I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers proposed to test the quantum nature of gravity and show that the Pancharatnam phase displays features that provide a qualitative distinction between semiclassical and quantum signatures of gravity. The semiclassical evolution of the system is equivalent to that of a single interferometer (a two-level system) in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution of the superposition in the Bloch sphere. In contrast, in the quantum case, the two interferometers are coupled (two two-level systems) and I find that the phase is continuous.         ",

This work addresses the rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and non-unique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and non-interpretable deep-learning-based methods, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based \"design$\\rightarrow$response\" forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex \"response$\\rightarrow$design\" inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We validate RIGID on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction.

    "abstract": "           While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.

    "abstract": "           Development and qualification of process parameters in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) commonly involves many variables. At the outset of development, whether transferring known parameters to a new machine, or exploring a new material, single-track and single-layer experiments are a convenient means of down-selecting key variables and exploring parameter scaling behavior. We present an experimental workflow for single-layer LPBF experiments using etched high-precision metal template substrates, overcoming challenges with precision single-layer alignment in LPBF systems and enabling efficient processing and cross-sectional analysis. Templates are fabricated using chemical etching and machining, and are characterized using optical profilometry and X-ray transmission imaging of powder layers. Using the templates a single-track parameter study is performed in SS316 including three powder layer thicknesses, and spanning common laser melting modes (lack-of-fusion, conduction, and keyhole mode). Analysis of melt track geometries using automated image processing allows a scaling law to be applied to define the process window, quantifying the amount of material added with increasing powder layer thickness. Single-track results are verified with raster scanning experiments, showing the potential to transfer single-track results to full LPBF builds.         ",

    "title": "Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems",
    "abstract": "           Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. Our recent work [arXiv:2108.13401] proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.

    "abstract": "           In this short paper, we propose a new quantum effect that naturally emerges from describing the quantum particle as a classical fluid. Following the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics for a particle in a finite convex region, we show how the maximum values of the wavefunction's amplitude lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum potential, implying\\ a classical flow velocity of the particle. The effect is obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian structures. We further show that such an effect\\ cannot be achieved in the relativistic regime when dealing with quantum particles in flat or curved spacetime.         ",

    "title": "Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and higher-order counter-propagating SPDC",
    "abstract": "           Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the inter-converted wavelengths. Here we comprehensively investigate the noise spectrum of a QFC device pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a bulk periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal quasi-phase-matched for conversion between 637 nm and 1587 nm, which was also polished and coated to resonantly enhance the pump field by a factor of 50. While Raman scattering dominates the noise background from 1140 nm to 1330 nm, at larger energy shifts (beyond 60 THz), parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is the strongest noise source. Further, the noise spectrum was contaminated by a regular succession of narrow-band peaks, which we attribute to a heretofore unidentified higher-order counter-propagating SPDC processes - with quasi-phase-matching orders up to 44 evident in our measurements. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the limiting noise sources in QFC devices that use quasi-phase-matched crystals and will prove an invaluable resource in guiding their future development.

    "title": "Spectral signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian transition in open quantum systems",
    "abstract": "           We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects. The spectral peak splitting can also be driven by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, although the underlying mechanism differs from that of dissipation-induced splitting. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. Moreover, we find that spectral features serve as highly sensitive indicators for distinguishing the geometric structures of aggregates, while also unveiling the critical role geometry plays in shaping non-Markovian behavior. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.         ",
