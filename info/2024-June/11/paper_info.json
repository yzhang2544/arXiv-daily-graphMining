The scenery involves the demise, or vanishing, of some valuable properties of the two electrons in the helium atom. We will start from experimentally based evidence in order to analyse and tentatively explain physical facts, moving cautiously from a classical to a quantum description. Statements such as 'a quantum superposition is like being in two states at the same time', 'quantum entanglement is like an instantaneous action at a distance', or 'facts are relative', will be prohibited as empty of explanatory content. As a spoiler, and maybe against current common wisdom, but not giving up physical realism, the conclusion of the enquiry will be that classical physics and quantum physics can neither function nor even be conceived one without the other - in line with ideas attributed to e.g. Niels Bohr or Lev Landau.

    "abstract": "           Topological photonics is an emergent research discipline which interlinks fundamental aspects of photonics, information processing and solid-state physics. Exciton-polaritons are a specifically interesting platform to study topological phenomena, since the coherent light matter coupling enables new degrees of freedom such as tunable non-linearities, chiralities and dissipation. Room-temperature operation of such exciton-polaritons relies on materials comprising both, large exciton binding energies and oscillator strength. We harness widely spectrally tunable, room temperature exciton-polaritons based on a WS2 monolayer in an open optical cavity to realize a polariton potential landscape which emulates the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian. It comprises a domain boundary hosting a topological, exponentially localized mode at the interface between two lattices characterized by different Zak-phases which features a spectral tunability over a range as large as 80 meV. Moreover, we utilize the unique tilt-tunability of our implementation, to transform the SSH-lattice into a Stark-ladder. This transformation couples the topologically protected defect mode to propagating lattice modes, and effectively changes the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, it allows us to directly quantify the Zak-phase difference $\\Delta_{Zak}=(1.13\\pm 0.11)\\pi$ between the two topological phases. Our work comprises an important step towards in-situ tuning topological lattices to control and guide light on non-linear chips.         ",

    "abstract": "           The statistical mechanical behavior of weakly nonlinear multimoded optical settings is attracting increased interest during the last few years. The main purpose of this work is to numerically investigate the main factors that affect the thermalization process in photonic lattices. In particular, we find that lattices with identically selected properties (such as temperature, coupling coefficient, lattice size, and excitation conditions) can exhibit very different thermalization dynamics and thus thermalization distances. Our investigation is focused on two different two-dimensional lattices: the honeycomb lattice and the triangular lattice. Our numerical results show that, independently of the excitation conditions, the honeycomb lattice always thermalizes faster than the triangular lattice. We mainly explain this behavior to the quasilinear spectrum that promotes wave-mixing in the honeycomb lattice in comparison to the power-like spectrum of the triangular lattice. In addition, we investigate the combined effects of temperature as well as the sign and magnitude of the nonlinearity. Switching either the sign of the Kerr nonlinear coefficient or the sign of the temperature can lead to significant differences in the thermalization dynamics, a phenomenon that can be physically explained in terms of wave instabilities. Larger absolute values of the temperature |T| result in more uniform distributions for the power occupation numbers and faster thermalization speeds. Finally, as expected, increasing the magnitude of the nonlinearity results in accelerated thermalization. Our findings provide valuable insights into optical thermalization in discrete systems where experimental realization may bring about new possibilities for light manipulation and applications.

A huge dual-frequency asymmetric transmission (AT) in the mid-infrared band (7800 nm-9000 nm) with transmission efficiency peaks of 0.14 and 0.26 is revealed, which is optimal of its similar monolayer counterparts in the current band. By changing the Fermi level of graphene and the relaxation time of its carriers, the AT spectrum including the positions and widths of the peaks can be effectively modulated.

    "abstract": "           In Free Space Optical (FSO) communication systems, atmospheric turbulence distorts the propagating beams, causing a random fading in the received power. This perturbation can be compensated using a multi-aperture receiver that samples the distorted wavefront on different points and adds the various signals coherently. In this work, we report on an adaptive optical receiver that compensates in real time for scintillation in FSO links. The optical front-end of the receiver is entirely integrated in a silicon photonic chip hosting a 2D Optical Antenna Array and a self-adaptive analog Programmable Optical Processor made of a mesh of tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The photonic chip acts as an adaptive interface to couple turbulent FSO beams to single-mode guided optics, enabling energy and cost-effective operation, scalability to systems with a larger number of apertures, modulation-format and data-protocol transparency, and pluggability with commercial fiber optics transceivers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver with optical signals at a data rate of 10 Gbit/s transmitted in indoor FSO links where different turbulent conditions, even stronger than those expected in outdoor links of hundreds of meters, are reproduced.

    "abstract": "           Intramolecular energy transport is generally responsible for chemical energy balance in molecular systems. The transport is fast and efficient if energy is transferred by optical phonons in periodic oligomers, but its efficiently is limited by decoherence emerging due to anharmonic interactions with acoustic phonons. We show that in the most common case of the optical phonon band being narrower than the acoustic bands decoherence takes place in two stages. The faster stage involves optical phonon multiple forward scattering due to absorption and emission of transverse acoustic phonons, i. e. collective bending modes with a quadratic spectrum; the transport remains ballistic and the speed can be altered. The subsequent slower stage involves phonon backscattering in multiphonon processes involving two or more acostic phonons resulting is a switch to diffusive transport. If the initially excited optical phonon possesses a relatively small group velocity, then its equilibration in the first stage is accompanied by its acceleration due to its transitions to states propagating faster. This theoretical expectation is consistent with the recent measurements of optical phonon transport in alkane chains, accelerating with increasing the chain length.         ",

Our approach borrows from concepts in variational quantum computing, where a search or optimisation problem is mapped onto the task of finding a minimum ground state energy for a given energy/goal function. We achieve this by a pseudo-random walk procedure over the parameter space of the unitary operation, implemented with optical matrix-vector multiplication enacted on arrays of Gaussian modes by exploiting the partial Fourier transforming capabilities of a cylindrical lens in the transverse degree of freedom for the measurement. We outline the concept theoretically, and experimentally demonstrate that we are able to learn optical unitary matrices for dimensions d = 2, 4, 8 and 16 with average fidelities of >90%.

The technique is demonstrated by generating far-field patterns of Bessel waves at these frequencies. The design employs metasurface patterns arranged as arrays of concentric rings atop rectangular silicon waveguides, collectively creating a Bessel beam. Dyadic Greens function integral equation techniques are used to model the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) fields in the metasurface radiation zone. Utilizing orthogonal vector wave functions, Bloch theorem, Floquet harmonics, and the transverse resonance technique, a photonic chip is designed to achieve a non-diffracting range of 500 um at the optical telecom wavelength of 1.5 um for a metasurface radius of 25 um. A radiation efficiency exceeding 80% is achieved by optimizing the attenuation constant (alpha) along the structure. The theoretical models are validated through simulations for both optical 1.5 um and Terahertz 14 um wavelengths, demonstrating significant alignment between predictions and simulation results.

The in-fiber MZI, formed using a segment of TCF optic, detects refractive index (RI) changes in the surrounding medium. The sensor utilizes the evanescent wave of one core as the sensing arm, necessitating a thin cladding achieved through one-sided chemical etching. This design allows the sensor to detect subtle alterations in the RI of the environment by observing displacements in the interference spectrum. The optogenetic stimulation of light-sensitive cells induces variations in ion concentrations, leading to a corresponding change in refractive index. The fabricated sensor, with a peak sensitivity of 675.74 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.39-1.43, can detect these changes. A computer simulation validated the sensitivity and optimized fabrication parameters, exhibiting satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Spectrum displacements were recorded for both light-sensitive hDPSCs and regular hDPSCs (as a control test). Results from the experiment, analyzed and compared using data analysis software, revealed that 473 nm blue light effectively stimulated light-sensitive hDPSCs. Notably, the proposed sensor, a novel structure, demonstrated its capability to detect RI changes in the cell medium during optogenetic applications.         ",

THz technology has found applications in various fields, from imaging and sensing to telecommunication and biosensing. However, the full potential of these applications is often hindered by the need for precise control and manipulation of the frequency and polarization state, which typically requires external THz modulators. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid THz source that overcomes this limitation. Our device consists of two THz emitters integrated into one single device, enabling pulse shaping and chirality control of the emitted radiation without additional external components. The two sources are a spintronic emitter and a semiconductor photoconductive antenna (PCA). Using a combination of dual-wavelength excitation, allowing for control of the relative time delay between the two laser excitation pulses, and tuning external parameters for each emitter (i.e., biasing voltage for the PCA and magnetic field for the spintronic THz emitter) enables precise control of the mixing of the two signals and results in frequency, polarization, and chirality control of the overall THz radiation. This on-chip hybrid emitter provides an essential platform for engineered THz radiation with wide-ranging potential applications.         ",

Here we establish the equivalence of this polarizability description of a metamaterial element with an equivalent circuit model, providing an additional tool for metasurface design that offers significant insight and a path towards efficiently modeling very large apertures. With this equivalence established, more complicated external circuits that include lumped elements and devices such as diodes and transistors can be integrated into the metamaterial element, which can then be transformed into an equivalent polarizability for modeling in the coupled dipole framework. We derive appropriate circuit models for several basic metamaterial elements, which provide direct relationships between the equivalent circuit parameters of an element and its effective polarizability.

The corresponding fields are respectively directionless steady line fields and directional instantaneous vector fields. Here we study the seminal topic of electromagnetic scattering from the perspective of instantaneous vector fields and uncover how the global topology of the momentum sphere regulates local distributions of tangent scattered fields. Structurally-stable generic singularities of vector fields move cyclically along lines of linear polarizations and at any instant their index sum has to be the Euler characteristic $\\chi=2$. This contrasts sharply with steady line fields, of which generic singularities constrained by the Euler characteristic locate on points of circular polarizations. From such unique perspective of instantaneous singularities, we discovered that for circularly-polarized waves scattered by electromagnetic duality-symmetric particles, since linearly-polarized scatterings are prohibited by helicity conservation, there must exist at least one dark direction along which the scattering is strictly zero. Two such dark directions can be tuned to overlap, along which the scattering would remain zero for arbitrary incident polarizations. We have essentially revealed that \\textit{polarizations underdescribe vectorial electromagnetic waves and the instantaneous perspective is indispensable}. The complementarity we discover provides broader and deeper insights into not only electromagnetism, but also other branches of wave physics where singularities are generic and ubiquitous.         ",

This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues. We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.

    "abstract": "           We present the new concept of photonic alloy as a non-periodic topological material. By mixing non-magnetized and magnetized rods in a non-periodic 2D photonic crystal configuration, we realized photonic alloys in the microwave regime. Our experimental findings reveal that the photonic alloy sustains non-reciprocal chiral edge states (CESs) even at very low concentration of magnetized rods. The non-trivial topology and the associated edge states of these non-periodic systems can be characterized by the winding of the reflection phase. Our results indicate that the threshold concentrations for the investigated system within the first non-trivial band gap to exhibit topological behavior approach zero in the thermodynamic limit for substitutional alloys, while the threshold remains non-zero for interstitial alloys. At low concentration, the system exhibits an inhomogeneous structure characterized by isolated patches of non-percolating magnetic domains that are spaced far apart within a topologically trivial photonic crystal. Surprisingly, the system manifests CESs despite a local breakdown of time-reversal symmetry rather than a global one. Photonic alloys represent a new category of disordered topological materials, offering exciting opportunities for exploring topological materials with adjustable gaps.         ",

Here, we use an IonQ 11-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, Harmony, to study the quantum wavepacket dynamics of a shared-proton within a short-strong hydrogen-bonded system. We also provide the first application of distributed quantum computing for chemical dynamics problems, where the distributed set of quantum processes is constructed using a tensor network formalism. For a range of initial states, we experimentally drive the ion-trap system to emulate the quantum nuclear wavepacket as it evolves along the potential surface generated from electronic structure. Following the experimental creation of the nuclear wavepacket, we extract measurement observables such as its time-dependent spatial projection and its characteristic vibrational frequencies to good agreement with classical results. Vibrational eigenenergies obtained from quantum computational are in agreement with those obtained from classical simulations to within a fraction of a kcal/mol, thus suggesting chemical accuracy. Our approach opens a new paradigm for studying the quantum chemical dynamics and vibrational spectra of molecules and also provides the first demonstration for parallel quantum computation on a distributed set of ion-trap quantum computers.

In recent years, quantum algorithms have been leveraged for the computation of open quantum systems as the predicted quantum advantage of quantum devices over classical ones may allow previously inaccessible applications. Accomplishing this goal will require input and expertise from different research perspectives, as well as the training of a diverse quantum workforce, making a compilation of current quantum methods for treating open quantum systems both useful and timely. In this Review, we first provide a succinct summary of the fundamental theory of open quantum systems and then delve into a discussion on recent quantum algorithms.

    "abstract": "           Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\u00e9nyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nonreciprocal photon blockade is of particular interest due to its potential applications in chiral quantum technologies and topological photonics. In the regular cases, nonreciprocal transmission (classical nonreciprocity) and nonreciprocal photon blockade (quantum nonreciprocity) often appear simultaneously. Nevertheless, how to achieve purely quantum nonreciprocity (no classical nonreciprocity) remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a spatially separated transmission scheme, that the photons transport in different directions take different paths, in an optical system consisting of two spinning cavities coupled indirectly by two common drop-filter waveguides. Based on the spatially separated transmission scheme, we demonstrate a purely quantum nonreciprocity (nonreciprocal photon blockade) by considering the Kerr nonlinear interaction in one of the paths. Interestingly, we find that the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced nonreciprocally, i.e., the nonreciprocal photon blockade is enhanced when the photons transport in one direction but suppressed in the reverse direction. We identify that the nonreciprocal enhancement of nonreciprocal photon blockade is induced by the destructive or constructive interference between two paths for two photons passing through the whole system. The spatially separated transmission scheme proposed in the work provides a novel approach to observe purely quantum nonreciprocal effects.         ",

Contrary to the common perception, the interference pattern can be made fully independent of phases acquired by the photons detected to construct it. However, it still contains information about spatially dependent phases acquired by the two undetected photons. This phenomenon can also be observed with fermionic particles. We show that the phenomenon can be applied to develop an interferometric, quantum phase imaging technique that is immune to uncontrollable phase fluctuations in the interferometer and allows image acquisition without detecting the photons illuminating the object.

    "abstract": "           In the previous paper [C. W. Kim and I. Franco, J. Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)], we developed a theory called MQME-D, which allows us to decompose the overall energy dissipation process in open quantum system dynamics into contributions by individual components of the bath when the subsystem dynamics is governed by a Markovian quantum master equation (MQME). Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.         ",
