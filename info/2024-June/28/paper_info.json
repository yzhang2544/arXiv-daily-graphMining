    "abstract": "           Nonlocal deformation sensing achieved by integrating atomic force microscopy indentation with nanodiamond-based orientation tracking features high precision and high spatial resolution, providing a useful technique for studying the mechanical properties of soft biological systems. However, this technique is currently limited to lifeless systems because it cannot differentiate the indentation-induced deformation from that associated with live activities or other external perturbations. Here we develop a dynamic nonlocal deformation sensing method using oscillatory nanoindentation and spectroscopic analysis to overcome this limitation. The method realizes both temporally and spatially resolved mechanical analysis, with tens of microsecond time-lag precision, nanometer vertical deformation precision, and sub-hundred nanometer lateral spatial resolution, leading to the disclosure of surface/interface effects in the mechanical response of viscoelastic materials and live cells. Neglecting surface tension would underestimate the liquid-like characteristics of the materials. This work demonstrates nanodiamond sensors as a useful tool for spatial-temporal mechanical analysis of soft, complex bio-relevant materials.         ",

Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \\frac{\\mathrm{pm}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments.

    "abstract": "           Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.         ",

Here, we demonstrate a novel nonlinear platform -- InGaP-on-insulator -- optimized for visible-to-telecommunication wavelength $\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}$ nonlinear optical processes. In this work, we detail our 100-mm wafer-scale InGaP-on-insulator fabrication process realized via wafer bonding, optical lithography, and dry-etching techniques. The resulting wafers yield 1000s of components in each fabrication cycle, with initial designs that include chip-to-fiber couplers, 12.5-cm-long nested spiral waveguides, and arrays of microring resonators with free-spectral ranges spanning 400-900 GHz. We demonstrate intrinsic resonator quality factors as high as 324,000 (440,000) for single-resonance (split-resonance) modes near 1550 nm corresponding to 1.56 dB cm$^{-1}$ (1.22 dB cm$^{-1}$) propagation loss. We analyze the loss versus waveguide width and resonator radius to establish the operating regime for optimal 775-to-1550 nm phase matching. By combining the high $\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}$ and $\\chi^{\\left(3\\right)}$ optical nonlinearity of InGaP with wafer-scale fabrication and low propagation loss, these results open promising possibilities for entangled-photon, multi-photon, and squeezed light generation.

We analyzed the cantilever's damping and vibration frequency in relation to a resonance length, where the frequencies of the droplet and the cantilever are equal. In the pre-resonance length, the beam vibrates at a frequency higher than that of the droplet. Upon reaching resonance, the frequencies of both the droplet and the cantilever align, and the cantilever is out of phase with the oscillation of the droplet's apex. This leads to increased damping rates. At this resonance length, the droplet's force and the direction of the cantilever oppose each other. When the cantilever length exceeds the resonance length, it synchronize more with the droplet apex. This alignment allows the droplet force and the cantilever to work in phase. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the damping effect of droplet impacts on elastic surfaces around resonance.         ",

Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with >2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Acoustic levitation is frequently used for non-contact manipulation of objects and to study the impact of microgravity on physical and biological processes. While the force field produced by sound pressure lifts particles against gravity (primary acoustic force), multiple levitating objects in the same acoustic cavity interact via forces that arise from scattered sound (secondary acoustic forces). Current experimental techniques for obtaining these force fields are not well-suited for mapping the primary force field at high spatial resolution and cannot directly measure the secondary scattering force. Here we introduce a method that can measure both acoustic forces in situ, including secondary forces in the near-field limit between arbitrarily shaped, closely spaced objects. Operating similarly to an atomic force microscope, the method inserts into the acoustic cavity a suitably shaped probe tip at the end of a long, flexible cantilever and optically detects its deflection. This makes it possible to measure forces with a resolution better than 50 nN, and also to apply stress or strain in a controlled manner to manipulate levitated objects. We demonstrate this by extracting the acoustic potential present in a levitation cavity, directly measuring the acoustic scattering force between two objects, and applying tension to a levitated granular raft of acoustically-bound particles in order to obtain the force-displacement curve for its deformation.

    "abstract": "           The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.

    "abstract": "           We propose encoding multiple qubits inside ions in existing trapped-ion quantum computers to access more qubits and to simplify circuits implementing standard algorithms. By using such `virtual' qubits, some inter-ion gates can be replaced by intra-ion gates, reducing the use of vibrational modes of the ion chain, leading to less noise. We discuss specific examples such as the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and random circuit sampling, using a small number of virtual qubits. Additionally, virtual qubits enable using larger number of data qubits for an error correcting code, and we consider the repetition code as an example. We also lay out practical considerations to be made when choosing states to encode virtual qubits in $^{137}\\mathrm{Ba}^+$ ions, and for preparing states and performing measurements.         ",

    "title": "Intersubjectivity and value reproducibility of outcomes of quantum measurements",
    "abstract": "           Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.

    "title": "A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits",
    "abstract": "           While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.         ",
