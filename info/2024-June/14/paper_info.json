    "title": "Quantum Hardware-Enabled Molecular Dynamics via Transfer Learning",
    "abstract": "           The ability to perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using potential energies calculated on quantum computers would allow virtually exact dynamics for chemical and biochemical systems, with substantial impacts on the fields of catalysis and biophysics. However, noisy hardware, the costs of computing gradients, and the number of qubits required to simulate large systems present major challenges to realizing the potential of dynamical simulations using quantum hardware. Here, we demonstrate that some of these issues can be mitigated by recent advances in machine learning. By combining transfer learning with techniques for building machine-learned potential energy surfaces, we propose a new path forward for molecular dynamics simulations on quantum hardware. We use transfer learning to reduce the number of energy evaluations that use quantum hardware by first training models on larger, less accurate classical datasets and then refining them on smaller, more accurate quantum datasets. We demonstrate this approach by training machine learning models to predict a molecule's potential energy using Behler-Parrinello neural networks. When successfully trained, the model enables energy gradient predictions necessary for dynamics simulations that cannot be readily obtained directly from quantum hardware. To reduce the quantum resources needed, the model is initially trained with data derived from low-cost techniques, such as Density Functional Theory, and subsequently refined with a smaller dataset obtained from the optimization of the Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz. We show that this approach significantly reduces the size of the quantum training dataset while capturing the high accuracies needed for quantum chemistry simulations.         ",

The number of optical elements typically scales with that of processed modes, leading to a direct correlation between system size, circuit complexity, and optical losses. Here we present a photonic circuit technology implementing large-scale unitary maps, linking a single input to hundreds of output modes in a two-dimensional compact layout. The map corresponds to the outcome of a quantum walk of structured photons, realized experimentally through light propagation in three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, having the local orientation of optic axes artificially engineered in a complex pattern. Theoretically, the walk length and the number of connected modes can be arbitrary, keeping optical losses constant. The patterns can be designed to accurately replicate multiple unitary maps. We also discuss limited reconfigurability by adjusting the overall birefringence and the relative displacement of the three optical elements. These results lay the basis for the design of low-loss photonic circuits that target a broader range of unitary maps, primarily for manipulating multi-photon states in genuinely quantum regimes.

In particular, two-dimensional PTIs have gained attention for the integrated circuit applications. However, controlling the topological phase after fabrication is difficult because the photonic topology requires the built-in specific structures. This study experimentally demonstrates the band inversion in two-dimensional PTI induced by the phase transition of deliberately-designed nanopatterns of a phase-change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), which indicates the first observation of the photonic topological phase transition with changes in the Chern number. This approach allows us to directly alter the topological invariants, which is achieved by symmetry-breaking perturbation through GST nanopatterns with different symmetry from original PTI. The success of our scheme is attributed to the ultrafine lithographic alignment technologies of GST nanopatterns. These results demonstrate to control photonic topological properties in a reconfigurable manner, providing an insight into new possibilities for reconfigurable photonic processing circuits.

In this Letter, we provide a comprehensive picture of these two nonlinear optical phenomena, unifying them through a common origin - asymmetry of the laser-target system. By tuning asymmetric laser-target systems, we discover a transition from the harmonic frequency shift to the odd-even intensity modulation upon increasing the duration of the driving laser pulse. Specifically, these phenomena are observed simultaneously for laser pulses with intermediate pulse duration. For numerical evidence, we solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, while insight into the underlying physics is obtained from a simplified analytically tractable model. Understanding the asymmetric characteristics reflected in the HHG as provided is crucial for retrieving laser-target information, sampling external fields, and probing molecular dynamics.         ",

    "abstract": "           A recently proposed strategy to boost the proton/ion cutoff energy in the target normal sheath acceleration scheme employs two obliquely incident laser pulses simultaneously irradiating the flat target rather than a single normally incident laser pulse of twice the pulse energy. Moreover, the presence of an externally applied magnetic field along the normal of the target's rear surface is known to reduce the angular divergence of hot electrons which results in a more efficient sheath field at the target rear leading to increased cutoff energy of accelerated protons/ions. In the present work, we employ two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to examine, in detail, the effect of such a magnetic field on the cutoff energy of protons/ions in the cases of normal as well as oblique incidence of the laser pulse on a flat target. It is shown that the two-oblique-pulse configuration combined with an external magnetic field results in a stronger enhancement of the cutoff energies as compared to the normal incidence case.

Four one- and two-color excitation schemes to probe the fine-structure states $4D_{3/2}$ and $4D_{5/2}$ are considered in detail. We compare key characteristics of Rb $4D_J$ and $5D_{5/2}$ two-photon clocks. The $4D_J$ clock features a high signal-to-noise ratio due to two-photon decay at favorable wavelengths, low dc electric and magnetic susceptibilities, and minimal black-body shifts. Ac Stark shifts from the clock interrogation lasers are compensated by two-color Rabi-frequency matching. We identify a \"magic\" wavelength near 1060~nm, which allows for in-trap, Doppler-free clock-transition interrogation with lattice-trapped cold atoms. From our analysis of clock statistics and systematics, we project a quantum-noise-limited relative clock stability at the $10^{-13}/\\sqrt{\\tau(s)}$-level, with integration time $\\tau$ in seconds, and a relative accuracy of $\\sim 10^{-13}$. We describe a potential architecture for implementing the proposed clock using a single telecom clock laser at 1550~nm, which is conducive to optical communication and long-distance clock comparisons. Our work could be of interest in efforts to realize small and portable Rb clocks and in high-precision measurements of atomic properties of Rb $4D_J$-states.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ge1-xSnx and Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys are promising materials for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. These alloys enable effective band-gap engineering, broad adjustability of their lattice parameter, exhibit much higher carrier mobility than pure Si, and are compatible with the CMOS technology. Unfortunately, the equilibrium solid solubility of Sn in Si1-xGex is less than 1% and the pseudomorphic growth of Si1-x-yGeySnx on Ge or Si can cause in-plane compressive strain in the grown layer, degrading the superior properties of these alloys. Therefore, post-growth strain engineering by ultrafast non-equilibrium thermal treatments like pulse laser annealing (PLA) is needed to improve the layer quality. In this article, Ge0.94Sn0.06 and Si0.14Ge0.8Sn0.06 thin films grown on silicon-on-insulator substrates by molecular beam epitaxy were post growth thermally treated by PLA. The material is analyzed before and after the thermal treatments by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Hall effect measurements. It is shown that after annealing, the material is single-crystalline with improved crystallinity than the as-grown layer. This is reflected in a significantly increased XRD reflection intensity, well-ordered atomic pillars, and increased active carrier concentrations up to 4x1019 cm-3.         ",

While conventional NMR spectrometers require large magnetic fields to interrogate a sample, recent advances in atomic magnetometry have enabled this spectroscopy far below geomagnetic field strengths. This zero-to-ultralow (ZULF) field regime can be advantageous since it mitigates relaxation and reveals spin couplings that are otherwise obscured, all while using compact and lower-overhead instrumentation. The resulting spectra are nonetheless difficult to interpret without computation, which can be taxing due to the presence of vector couplings and long-range spin networks. Following recent proposals, we demonstrate how fault-tolerant quantum computation could be used to simulate these spectra. Our analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits based on qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how NMR spectral prediction might be an early application for fault-tolerant quantum computers.         ",

By doing so, we reveal important features of these spatiotemporal metasurfaces: scattering parameters, field profiles, diffraction angles and nature of the space-time harmonics. The results, corroborated with a self-implemented numerical FDTD approach, show the potential application of these space-time metasurfaces as beamformers acting in reflection, in transmission or both. The amplitude and direction of the diffracted orders can be electronically controlled with the paramaters of the metasurface. Moreover, the intrinsic ability of time-modulated diffractive metasurfaces to mix and multiply frequencies is tested.
