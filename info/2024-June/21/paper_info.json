    "abstract": "           This study evaluates more than 4,000 tiles made of Hamamatsu visual-sensitive silicon photomultipier (SiPM), each with dimensions of 5 $\\times$ 5 cm$^2$, intended for the central detector of the Taishan Anti-neutrino Observatory (TAO), a satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) aimed at measuring the reactor anti-neutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution. All SiPM tiles underwent a room temperature burn-in test in the dark for two weeks, while cryogenic testing analyzed the thermal dependence of parameters for some sampled SiPMs. Results from these comprehensive tests provide crucial insights into the long-term performance and stability of the 10 square meters of SiPMs operating at -50\u00b0C to detect scintillation photons in the TAO detector. Despite some anomalies awaiting further inspection, all SiPMs successfully passed the burn-in test over two weeks at room temperature, which is equivalent to 6.7 years at -50\u00b0C. Results are also used to guide optimal SiPM selection, configuration, and operation, ensuring reliability and sustainability in reactor neutrino measurements. This work also provides insights for a rapid and robust quality assessment in future experiments that employ large-scale SiPMs as detection systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Brownian motion of a number of quantum states in a compact one-dimensional space is studied via the Wiener fractal measure, and it is shown that the derived path-integral measure coincides precisely with the Polyakov path-integral formula for bosonic string theory. Thus, it is concluded that the Polyakov action of bosonic string theory does not have a unique, distinguishable foundation specifically dedicated to describing the fundamental forces of nature, but rather, it is merely a standard formulation of the Wiener stochastic process for Brownian motion of the quantum states on one-dimensional objects. It is also demonstrated that the time-dimension field is, in practice, the localization of the non-local effects of the coordinate fields. This indicates that the interpretation intended for spacetime fields in the formulation of string theory allegedly faces fundamental flaws in its underlying theoretical aspects. In this regard, we will defend string theory against its experimental flaws in particle physics due to unreliable interpretation of the theory and relate its elaborated mathematical framework to another significant topic: Quantum Brain. ....

    "abstract": "           Simulating plasma physics on quantum computers is difficult, because most problems of interest are nonlinear, but quantum computers are not naturally suitable for nonlinear operations. In weakly nonlinear regimes, plasma problems can be modeled as wave-wave interactions. In this paper, we develop a quantization approach to convert nonlinear wave-wave interaction problems to Hamiltonian simulation problems. We demonstrate our approach using two qubits on a superconducting device. Unlike a photonic device, a superconducting device does not naturally have the desired interactions in its native Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, Hamiltonian simulations can still be performed by decomposing required unitary operations into native gates. To improve experimental results, we employ a range of error mitigation techniques. Apart from readout error mitigation, we use randomized compilation to transform undiagnosed coherent errors into well-behaved stochastic Pauli channels. Moreover, to compensate for stochastic noise, we rescale exponentially decaying probability amplitudes using rates measured from cycle benchmarking. We carefully consider how different choices of product-formula algorithms affect the overall error and show how a trade-off can be made to best utilize limited quantum resources. This study provides a point example of how plasma problems may be solved on near-term quantum computing platforms.         ",

I argue that nonetheless unitary dynamics continues to have a special place in physics, via the empirically-well-supported reductionist principles that non-unitarity is to be explained by restriction to a subsystem of a larger unitary system and that microscopic physics is governed by unitary and largely known dynamics.

    "abstract": "           Therapeutic ultrasound for brain stimulation has increased in the last years. This energy has shown promising results for treating Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and traumatic brain injury, among other conditions. However, the application of ultrasound in the brain should trespass a natural but highly attenuating and distorting barrier, the cranium. Implantable ceramic materials can be used to replace part of the cranium as an alternate method to enhance ultrasound transmission. In this work, it is presented the acoustic characterization of alumina ceramic disks that can be employed as cranial implants for acoustic windows-to-the-brain. Alumina samples were prepared using current-activated pressure-assisted densification and were acoustically characterized. Acoustic impedance and attenuation of the samples were determined for different porosities. Additionally, measured and modeled acoustic fields are presented and analyzed in terms of the total ultrasound transmitted through the ceramics. Results indicate a resonant behavior in the alumina disks when the thickness corresponds to a half-wavelength of ultrasound; this resonance permits a total of 95.4% of ultrasound transmission; for thicknesses out of the resonant zone, transmission is 53.0%. Alumina proves to be an excellent medium for ultrasound transmission that, in conjunction with its mechanical and optical properties, can be useful for cranium replacement in mixed opto-acoustic applications.

As such, it has been successfully established in the near-infrared (NIR) telecommunication bands. With the soaring demand in miniaturized systems for biosensing, quantum information and transportable atomic clocks, extensive endeavors have been stacked on translating integrated photonics into the visible spectrum, i.e. visible-light integrated photonics. Various innovative visible-light integrated devices have been demonstrated, such as lasers, frequency combs, and atom traps, highlighting the capacity and prospect to create chip-based optical atomic clocks that can make timing and frequency metrology ubiquitous. A pillar to the development of visible-light integrated photonics is characterization techniques featuring high frequency resolution and wide spectral coverage, which however remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) for visible-light integrated photonics, offering spectral bandwidth from 766 to 795 nm and frequency resolution of 415 kHz. The VSA is rooted on a widely chirping, high-power, narrow-linewidth, mode-hop-free laser around 780 nm, which is frequency-doubled from the near-infrared via an efficient, broadband CPLN waveguide. The VSA is further referenced to hyperfine structures of rubidium and potassium atoms, enabling 8.1 MHz frequency accuracy. We apply our VSA to showcase the characterization of loss, dispersion and phase response of passive integrated devices, as well as densely spaced spectra of mode-locked lasers. Combining operation in the NIR and visible spectra, our VSA allows characterization bandwidth exceeding an octave and can be an invaluable diagnostic tool for spectroscopy, nonlinear optical processing, imaging and quantum interfaces to atomic devices.

The amplification chain assists the signal receiver to read the signal from the cavity and requires accurate calibration. Typically, the readout line is calibrated using the Y-factor method, involving a switch that directs the signal from either the detection line or the calibration line. However, this switch introduces several disadvantages. In response, we propose a calibration method that eliminates the need for a switch. In this approach, the cavity temperature is decoupled to its incoming noise source and can be controlled, resulting in excess or deficiency of the noise spectrum near its resonance frequency. The experimental result shows that the amplification chain can be calibrated directly using the temperature-varied cavity-emitted radiation.         ",

    "abstract": "           The dielectric constant of a sheath, whether ionic or electronic, formed around the cylindrical limbs of a hairpin probe, is often considered the same as that of a vacuum. However, this assumption does not hold true for electron sheaths and electron-permeating ionic sheaths, resulting in a deviation of the sheath dielectric constant from that of a vacuum. This deviation significantly influences the effective dielectric between the cylindrical limbs. As a result, it impacts the theoretically estimated resonance frequency characteristic curve of a DC-biased hairpin probe. In this study, we investigate the influence of electron temperature on the sheath dielectric and, consequently, on the resonance frequency characteristic curve. The findings shows that electron temperature primarily determines the resonance frequency characteristic curve. With increasing electron temperature, the peak in the resonance frequency characteristic curve shifts towards higher positive probe bias values and exhibits a broadening near the maxima instead of a sharp peak. This broadening near the maxima has also been validated with an experimentally measured resonance frequency characteristic curve in a capacitively coupled argon discharge.         ",

In the terahertz frequency range, semiconductor-based quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are ideal platforms for realizing the frequency comb operation. Although self-started frequency comb operation can be obtained in free-running terahertz QCLs due to the four-wave mixing locking effects, resonant/off-resonant microwave injection, phase locking, and femtosecond laser based locking techniques have been widely used to broaden and stabilize terahertz QCL combs. These active locking methods indeed show significant effects on the frequency stabilization of terahertz QCL combs, but they simultaneously have drawbacks, such as introducing large phase noise and requiring complex optical coupling and/or electrical circuits. Here, we demonstrate Farey tree locking of terahertz QCL frequency combs under microwave injection. The frequency competition between the Farey fraction frequency and the cavity round-trip frequency results in the frequency locking of terahertz QCL combs, and the Farey fraction frequencies can be accurately anticipated based on the downward trend of the Farey tree hierarchy. Furthermore, dual-comb experimental results show that the phase noise of the dual-comb spectral lines is significantly reduced by employing the Farey tree locking method. These results pave the way to deploying compact and low phase noise terahertz frequency comb sources.         ",

Reservoir computing encompasses recurrent neural networks for sequential data processing and matches the performance of other recurrent networks with less training and lower costs. However, traditional software-based neural networks suffer from high energy consumption due to computational demands and massive data transfer needs. Photonic reservoir computing overcomes this challenge with energy-efficient neuromorphic photonic integrated circuits or NeuroPICs. Here, we introduce a reservoir NeuroPIC used for modulation format identification in C-band telecommunication network monitoring. It is built on a silicon-on-insulator platform with a 4-port reservoir architecture consisting of a set of physical nodes connected via delay lines. We comprehensively describe the NeuroPIC design and fabrication, experimentally demonstrate its performance, and compare it with simulations. The NeuroPIC incorporates non-linearity through a simple digital readout and achieves close to 100% accuracy in identifying several configurations of quadrature amplitude modulation formats transmitted over 20 km of optical fiber at 32 GBaud symbol rate. The NeuroPIC performance is robust against fabrication imperfections like waveguide propagation loss, phase randomization, etc. and delay line length variations. Furthermore, the experimental results exceeded numerical simulations, which we attribute to enhanced signal interference in the experimental NeuroPIC output. Our energy-efficient photonic approach has the potential for high-speed temporal data processing in a variety of applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this work, a microwave photonic prototype for concurrent radar detection and spectrum sensing is proposed, designed, built, and investigated. A direct digital synthesizer and an analog electronic circuit are integrated to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) signal with a tunable center frequency from 2.5 to 9.5 GHz and an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz. The IF LFM signal is converted to the optical domain via an intensity modulator and then filtered by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) to generate only two 2nd-order optical LFM sidebands. In radar detection, the two optical LFM sidebands beat with each other to generate a frequency-and-bandwidth-quadrupled LFM signal, which is used for ranging, radial velocity measurement, and imaging. By changing the center frequency of the IF LFM signal, the radar function can be operated within 8 to 40 GHz. In spectrum sensing, one 2nd-order optical LFM sideband is selected by another FBG, which then works in conjunction with the stimulated Brillouin scattering gain spectrum to map the frequency of the signal under test to time with an instantaneous measurement bandwidth of 2 GHz. By using a frequency shift module to adjust the pump frequency, the frequency measurement range can be adjusted from 0 to 40 GHz. The prototype is comprehensively studied and tested, which is capable of achieving a range resolution of 3.75 cm, a range error of less than $\\pm$ 2 cm, a radial velocity error within $\\pm$ 1 cm/s, delivering clear imaging of multiple small targets, and maintaining a frequency measurement error of less than $\\pm$ 7 MHz and a frequency resolution of better than 20 MHz.

    "abstract": "           We study barrier discharges in CO$_2$ using optical emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements. We record the spectra of weak CO$_2$ barrier discharge emission in UV-VIS-NIR range. The CO spectral bands of 3rd positive, Angstrom and Asundi systems are identified in the spectra, together with the CO+2 bands of the UV-doublet and the Fox-Duffendack-Baker systems. The effect of CO$_2$ flow rate variations on the relative intensities of the CO and CO$_2$ optical emissions is also investigated. We analyze the optical emission of selected vibrational spectral bands and attempt to determine the E/N using intensity ratio method with kinetic data available in the literature. The method, using intensities from different spectral bands, is tested on sinusoidal driven atmospheric pressure Townsend (APTD) and single-filament barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure. For APTD at different flows and known CO conversion factors, an attempt is made to use the ratio of selected CO to CO$_2$ band intensities. The technique of time-correlated single photon counting is used to obtain necessary sub-nanosecond temporal resolution and, importantly, high signal sensitivity for the single-filament experiment and its utilization gives a promising result, E/N of 330 Td in barrier discharge streamer. Nevertheless, the uncertainties coming from different kinetic data and the low sensitivity of some rate coefficient ratios complicate an easy utilisation of the method. Future steps are therefore proposed, including uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the simplified model and necessary CO+2 and CO synthetic spectra fitting.         ",

    "abstract": "           Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and conventional Quantum Chemistry (QC) computational methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties ranging from atomization energies to excitation energies. Various datasets such as MD17, MD22, and WS22, which consist of properties calculated at some level of QC method, or fidelity, have been generated to benchmark such ML models. The term fidelity refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method to the actual real value of the property. The higher the fidelity, the more accurate the calculated property, albeit at a higher computational cost. Research in multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where ML models are trained on data from more than one numerical QC method, has shown the effectiveness of such models over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. A major hurdle for effective research in this field of research in the community is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. Here, we present a comprehensive multifidelity dataset drawn from the WS22 molecular conformations. We provide the quantum Chemistry MultiFidelity (CheMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice and are namely: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. CheMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties including vertical excitation energies, oscillator strengths, molecular dipole moments, and ground state energies.

The micropatterned array of these photonic units is spectroscopically characterized in detail and optimized with respect to both signal contrast and cross-talk. The optimum optical parameters including laser intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation are elucidated and ideal conditions for creating reversible on/off cycles in a micropatterned array are determined. 500 such cycles are demonstrated with no obvious on/off contrast attenuation. The ability to process binary information is demonstrated by selectively writing information to the given photonic unit, reading the resultant emissive signal pattern and finally erasing the information again, which in turn demonstrates the possibility of continuous recording. This basic study paves the way for building complex circuits using spatially well-arranged photonic units.         ",

Yet, the origin of its strong dependence on film deposition and fabrication process is not fully understood. This Letter leverages nanomechanical photothermal sensing to investigate optical extinction $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ at 632.8 nm wavelength in LPCVD SiN strings across a wide range of deposition-related tensile stresses ($200-850$ MPa). Measurements reveal a reduction in $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ from 10$^3$ to 10$^1$ ppm with increasing stress, correlated to variations in Si/N content ratio. Within the band-fluctuations framework, this trend indicates an increase of the energy bandgap with the stress, ultimately reducing absorption. Overall, this study showcases the power and simplicity of nanomechanical photothermal sensing for low absorption measurements, offering a sensitive, scattering-free platform for material analysis in nanophotonics and nanomechanics.

    "abstract": "           Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have shown low linear loss, negligible nonlinear loss, and high power handling over traditional silicon photonics. To achieve high-density photonic integration and high effective nonlinearity through tight optical confinement, thick stoichiometric Si$_3$N$_4$ films are indispensable. However, when using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) to achieve high optical material transparency, Si$_3$N$_4$ films exhibit large tensile stress on the order of GPa. Methods for crack prevention are therefore essential. The photonic Damascene process has addressed this issue, attaining record low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs, but it lacks control of the waveguide height. Conversely, precise waveguide dimension and ultra-low loss have been achieved with subtractive processing, but this method is not compatible with mass production due to the use of electron beam lithography. To date, an outstanding challenge is to attain both lithographic precision and ultra-low loss in high confinement Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that are compatible with large-scale foundry manufacturing. Here, we present a single-step deposited, DUV-based subtractive method for producing wafer-scale ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that harmonize these necessities. By employing deep etching of densely distributed, interconnected trenches into the substrate, we effectively mitigate the tensile stress in the Si$_3$N$_4$ layer, enabling direct deposition of thick films without cracking and substantially prolonged storage duration. Lastly, we identify ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage that can be remedied through rapid thermal annealing. Collectively, we develop ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators and 0.5 m-long spiral waveguides with losses down to 1.4 dB/m at 1550 nm with high production yield.         ",

The PIC is designed to provide relaxed alignment tolerance for coupling to a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) gain chip. This is achieved by using a multi-mode edge coupler (MMEC) in place of the usually employed single-mode coupling schemes. A 1-dB-penalty misalignment tolerance of up to +/- 2.4 um can be achieved in the plane of the chip, creating a path towards reliable flip-chip integration at short wavelengths. The power coupled to the PIC is fed to a Sagnac-loop reflector, filtered by a pair of ring resonators operated in Vernier configuration for providing the required frequency selective optical feedback. The ring resonators are designed to have different loaded Q-factors and they are asymmetrically coupled to bus and drop waveguides with suitably engineered directional couplers to provide single output waveguide emission. Moreover, requirements for high output power and narrow linewidths are balanced.

    "abstract": "           We present experimental results for a fully etched C-band grating coupler with reduced back reflection fabricated in an 800 nm silicon nitride platform. Back-reflections are reduced by symmetrically interrupting the first few grates around the center axis of the propagating light. The span of the etched grates is gradually increased until they cover the full width. By interrupting the grates, light is reflected back obliquely, which leads to the excitation of higher-order modes that are scattered out of the structure. While this approach has been previously shown in silicon, it comes with a significant penalty in coupling efficiency of around 2.4 dB of extra loss in the layer stack investigated here. In this work, we present the design and measurement results of a grating coupler in which waveguide-to-waveguide back-reflections are suppressed by ~10 dB with this technique, while at the same time mitigating excess insertion losses by reshaping the grates as ellipses of varying eccentricity. This helps to compensate the phase front error induced by the interruption of the grates. This correction does not affect the level by which the back-reflection is suppressed, but reduces the insertion loss penalty from 2.4 dB to 1 dB.         ",

The anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) lasers in the NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) spectral domain show a great potential for spectroscopy and high-resolution gas detection. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of a frequency-comb-like Raman laser with high pulse energy spanning from ultraviolet (UV) (328 nm) to NIR (2065 nm wavelength) based on a hydrogen (H2)-filled 7-ring ARHCF.

We report the efficient detection of CH4 with sensitivity as low as ~550 ppb with an integration time of ~40 s.

    "abstract": "           We present the fabrication of conductive graphitic microelectrodes in diamond by using pulsed Bessel beams in the burst mode laser writing regime. The graphitic wires are created in the bulk of a 500 {\\mu}m thick monocrystalline HPHT diamond (with (100) orientation) perpendicular to the sample surface, without beam scanning or sample translation. In particular, the role of different burst features in the resistivity of such electrodes is investigated for two very different sub-pulse durations namely 200 fs and 10 ps, together with the role of thermal annealing. Micro-Raman spectroscopy is implemented to investigate the laser-induced crystalline modification, and the results obtained by using two different laser repetition rates, namely 20 Hz and 200 kHz, are compared. A comparison of the micro-Raman spectra and of the resistivity of the electrodes fabricated respectively with 10 ps single pulses and with bursts (of sub-pulses) of similar total duration has also been made, and we show that the burst mode writing regime allows to fabricate more conductive micro electrodes, thanks to the heat accumulation process leading to stronger graphitization. Moreover, the microfabrication of diamond by means of the longest available bursts (~ 46.7 ps duration) featured by 32 sub-pulses of 200 fs duration, with intra-burst time delay of 1.5 ps (sub-THz bursts), leads to graphitic wires with the lowest resistivity values obtained in this work, especially at low repetition rate such as 20 Hz. Indeed, micro electrodes with resistivity on the order of 0.01 {\\Omega} cm can be fabricated by Bessel beams in the burst mode regime even when the bursts are constituted by femtosecond laser sub-pulses, in contrast with the results of the standard writing regime with single fs pulses typically leading to less conductive micro electrodes.

In addition to suitable classification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied to Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application investigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the Learning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve this, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical circuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the results of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was considered and mitigated. The benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current literature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with Errors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently complex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future work would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple Chua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such architectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve the Learning with Errors problem. This project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based Reservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to challenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also original by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their impact on performance. It demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a mass-producible, inexpensive, low-power consumption hardware neural network. It also enables the next stages in research to occur, paving the road for using Chua-based Reservoir Computers across various applications.         ",

In this work, we leverage Trotterization to map coherent radical pair spin dynamics onto a digital gate-based quantum simulation. Our results demonstrated agreement between the idealized noiseless quantum circuit simulation and established master equation approaches for homogeneous radical pair recombination, identifying approximately 15 Trotter steps to be sufficient for faithfully reproducing the coupled spin dynamics of a prototypical system. By utilizing this computational technique to study the dynamics of spin systems of biological relevance, our findings underscore the potential of digital quantum simulation (DQS) of complex radical pair reactions and builds the groundwork towards more utilitarian investigations into their intricate reaction dynamics. We further investigate the effect of realistic error models on our DQS approach, and provide an upper limit for the number of Trotter steps that can currently be applied in the absence of error mitigation techniques before losing simulation accuracy to deleterious noise effects.

    "abstract": "           The SLAC Microresonator Radio Frequency (SMuRF) electronics is being deployed as the readout for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) telescopes of the Simons Observatory (SO). A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) based readout of microwave frequency resonator based cryogenic sensors is under development at SLAC as an upgrade path for SMuRF with simplified RF hardware, a more compact footprint, and lower total power consumption. The high-speed integrated data converters and digital data path in RFSoC enable direct RF sampling without analog up and down conversion for RF frequencies up to 6 GHz. A comprehensive optimization and characterization study has been performed for direct RF sampling for microwave SQUID multiplexers, which covers noise level, RF dynamic range, and linearity using a prototype implementation. The SMuRF firmware, including the implementation of closed-loop tone tracking, has been ported to the RFSoC platform and interfaced with the quadrature mixers for digital up and down conversion in the data converter data path to realize a full microwave SQUID multiplexer readout. In this paper, a selection of the performance characterization results of direct RF sampling for microwave SQUID multiplexer readout will be summarized and compared with science-driven requirements. Preliminary results demonstrating the read out of cryogenic sensors using the prototype system will also be presented here. We anticipate our new RFSoC-based SMuRF system will be an enabling readout for on-going and future experiments in astronomy and cosmology, which rely on large arrays of cryogenic sensors to achieve their science goals.

Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.

We compare different manners of modeling the environment. Sampling the Fourier transform of the bath correlation function, also called temperature dependent spectral density, proves to be very effective. T-TEDOPA (Tamascelli et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 090402 (2019)) uses a linear chain of oscillators with positive and negative frequencies while HEOM is based on the complex poles of an optimized rational decomposition of the temperature dependent spectral density (Xu et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 230601 (2022)). Resorting to the poles of the temperature independent spectral density and of the Bose function separately is an alternative when the problem due to the huge number of the Bose poles at low temperature is circumvented. Two examples illustrate the effectiveness of the HEOM and T-TEDOPA approaches: a benchmark pure dephasing case and a two-bath model simulating dynamics of excited electronic states coupled through a conical intersection. We show the efficiency of T-TEDOPA to simulate dynamics at a finite temperature by using either continuous spectral densities or only all the intramolecular oscillators of a linear vibronic model calibrated from ab initio data of a phenylene ethynylene dimer.

    "abstract": "           Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.

These advances demand better understanding of how quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects influence collective plasma phenomena. In particular, Maxwell's equations become nonlinear in the strong-QED regime. Here we present the `QED plasma framework' which will allow one to {\\em systematically} explore collective phenomena in a QED-plasma with arbitrarily strong magnetic field. Further, we illustrate the framework by exploring low-frequency modes in the ultra-magnetized, cold, electron-positron plasmas. We demonstrate that the classical picture of five branches holds in the QED regime; no new eigenmodes appear. The dispersion curves of all the modes are modified. The QED effects include the overall modification to the plasma frequency, which becomes field-dependent. They also modify resonances and cutoffs of the modes, which become both field- and angle-dependent. The strongest effects are (i) the {\\em field-induced transparency of plasma} for the O-mode via the dramatic reduction of the low-frequency cutoff well below the plasma frequency, (ii) the {\\em Alfven mode suppression} in the large-$k$ regime via the reduction of the Alfven mode resonance, and (iii) the {\\em O-mode slowdown} via strong angle-dependent increase of the index of refraction. These results should be important for understanding of a magnetospheric pair plasma of a magnetar and for laboratory laser-plasma experiments in the QED regime.         ",

A spherical resonator, specifically a homogeneous dielectric sphere in a vacuum, perturbed by two point-like defects which break the spherical symmetry and bring the optical modes to EPs, is used as a worked example. The RSE is a non-perturbative approach encoding the information about an open optical system in matrix form in a rigorous way, and thus offering a suitable tool for studying its EPs. These are simultaneous degeneracies of the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the system, which are rigorously described by the RSE and illustrated for perturbed whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). An exceptional arc, which is a line of adjacent EPs, is obtained analytically for perturbed dipolar WGMs. Perturbation of high-quality WGMs with large angular momentum and their EPs are found by reducing the RSE equation to a two-state problem by means of an orthogonal transformation of a large RSE matrix. WGM pairs have opposite chirality in spherically symmetric systems and equal chirality at EPs. This chirality at EPs can be observed in circular dichroism measurements, as it manifested itself in a squared-Lorentzian part of the optical spectra, which we demonstrate here analytically and numerically in the Purcell enhancement factor for the perturbed dipolar WGMs.         ",

Together with the possibility to address this degree of freedom by valley-contrasting optical selection rules, it has the potential to enable a completely new class of future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Resonant optical nanostructures emerge as promising tools for interacting with and controlling the valley degree of freedom at the nanoscale. However, a critical understanding gap remains in how nanostructures and their nearfields affect the circular polarization properties of valley-selective emission hindering further developments in this field. In order to address this issue, our study delves into the experimental investigation of a hybrid model system where valley-specific emission from a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide is interacting with a resonant plasmonic nanosphere. Contrary to the simple intuition suggesting that a centrosymmetric nanoresonator preserves the degree of circular polarization in the forward scattered farfield by angular momentum conservation, our cryogenic photoluminescence microscopy reveals that the light emitted from the nanoparticle position is largely unpolarized, i.e. we observe depolarization. We rigorously study the nature of this phenomenon numerically considering the monolayer-nanoparticle interaction at different levels including excitation and emission. In doing so, we find that the farfield degree of polarization strongly reduces in the hybrid system when including excitons emitting from outside of the system's symmetry point, which in combination with depolarisation at the excitation level causes the observed effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatially distributed emitters for precise predictions of polarization responses in these hybrid systems.         ",

The dependence on the proton fluence of the efficiency and the time resolution of this prototype was measured with the frontend electronics operated at a power density between 0.13 and 0.9 W/cm2. The testbeam data show that the detection efficiency of 99.96% measured at sensor bias voltage of 200 V before irradiation becomes 96.2% after a fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2. An increase of the sensor bias voltage to 300 V provides an efficiency to 99.7% at that proton fluence. The timing resolution of 20 ps measured before irradiation rises for a proton fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2 to 48 and 44 ps at HV = 200 and 300 V, respectively.         ",

    "title": "Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data",
    "abstract": "           The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.

This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method, including an iterative method \"Iterative-QLS\" that suppresses error in quantum linear solver, and a subspace method to scale the solution to a larger size. We implement our method on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimensional matrix. We emphasize the utilization of the quantum-classical hybrid approach in applications of near-term quantum computers. By adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, our method paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.

    "abstract": "           The present study explores radiation in THz spectrum region through the interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma. The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.         ",

In this work, we demonstrate a new paradigm for assembly of atomic arrays, based on a synergistic combination of optical tweezers and cavity-enhanced optical lattices, and the incremental filling of a target array from a repetitively filled reservoir. In this protocol, the tweezers provide microscopic rearrangement of atoms, while the cavity-enhanced lattices enable the creation of large numbers of optical traps with sufficient depth for rapid low-loss imaging of atoms. We apply this protocol to demonstrate near-deterministic filling (99% per-site occupancy) of 1225-site arrays of optical traps. Because the reservoir is repeatedly filled with fresh atoms, the array can be maintained in a filled state indefinitely. We anticipate that this protocol will be compatible with mid-circuit reloading of atoms into a quantum processor, which will be a key capability for running large-scale error-corrected quantum computations whose durations exceed the lifetime of a single atom in the system.

    "abstract": "           Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light-matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be, in principles, enhanced by $\\approx 73\\%$ ($\\approx 40\\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. However, in a realistic cavity, we expect the T$_{\\rm{c}}$ of MgB$_2$ can increase, at most, by $5$ K via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light-matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.         ",
