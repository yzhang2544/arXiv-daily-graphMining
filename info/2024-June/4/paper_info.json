Our optical analogues preserve the statistical properties of their quantum counterparts, encoded in their amplitude and phase distributions. We explore three basic symmetries that provide generalized displaced, rotated, and squeezed coherent states. Given the substantial interest in squeezed states for probing matter, we believe that the optical analogues introduced here have significant implications for optical sensing. Specifically, the single-particle nature of our spatial modes makes them robust candidates for sensing photosensitive materials. Overall, our approach opens the door to optical metrology and sensing protocols that mimic those already existing in the quantum realm, and facilitates further exploration of the quantum state zoo through classical optical analogues.

However, the process of building an experimental setup and developing the supporting code to measure the fiber's transmission matrix remains challenging with full details on experimental design, data collection, and supporting algorithms spread over multiple papers or lacking in detail. Here, we outline a complete and self-contained description of the experiment we use to measure fully polarization-resolved transmission matrices. Our specific implementation of the full polarization experiment is new and is easy to align while providing flexibility to switch between full-polarization and scalar measurements if desired. We introduce a new method to measure and account for the phase and amplitude drift during the measurement using a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting algorithm. Finally, we describe creating distal images through the multimode fiber using phase-to-amplitude shaping techniques to construct the correct input electric field and show that results are insensitive to this choice as quantified by measuring the contrast of a razor blade at the distal end of the fiber. Throughout the paper, we discuss applications of our setup and measurement process to a variety of specialty fibers, including fibers with harsh environment coatings, coreless fibers, rectangular core fibers, pedestal fibers, and a pump-signal combiner based on a tapered fiber bundle.

Traditionally, these processes are modeled using simulations that describe the electronic structure at an atomic level, thereby omitting molecular bonding effects. This work addresses the gap by introducing a novel approach that couples a decay spawning dynamics algorithm with \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the potential energy surfaces. We apply our method to a model decay cascade following K-shell ionization of IBr and subsequent K$_{\\beta}$ fluorescence decay. We examine two competing channels that undergo two decay steps, resulting in ion-pairs with a total +3 charge state. This approach provides a continuous description of the electron transfer dynamics occurring during the multi-step decay cascade and molecular fragmentation, revealing the charge transfer timescale to be approximately 75 fs. Our computed kinetic energies of ion fragments show good agreement with experimental data.         ",

In this study, drawing inspiration from synchrotrons that resonate to accelerate ions along a closed path, we introduce the concept of a synchrowave: a waveguide designed to generate and sustain travelling water waves within a closed annular channel. In analogy to unavoidable energy losses in conventional particle accelerators due to electromagnetic radiation and inelastic collisions, the system displays undesired water-wave dampening, which we address through the synchronised action of underwater wavemakers. Our analogies extend the resonance mechanisms of synchrotrons to generate gravity waves in closed waveguides efficiently. A proof-of-concept experiment at a laboratory scale demonstrates the unique capability of this technique to build up anomalously large travelling waves displaying a flat response in the long-wave limit. Besides quantifying the performance of wave generation, our findings offer a framework for both industrial and computational applications, opening up unexplored possibilities in hydraulics, coastal science and engineering. In a broader context, our experimental apparatus and methods highlight the versatility of a simple yet powerful concept: a closed-path continuous-energy-pumping scheme to effectively harvest prominent resonant responses within wave-supporting systems displaying weak dissipation.

Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and upcoming quantum hardware presents noise in the computations, requiring algorithms that make modest use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust under resource restrictions. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Classical devices perform nonlinear computations, and quantum ones use variational algorithms to solve the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. A multigrid preconditioning approach helps avoid local minima. HTree, a tomography technique with linear complexity in qubit count, reduces the quantum state readout time. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.         ",

However, current systems face challenges with the separation of state modulation and acquisition, leading to undesired time delays that impact real-time performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce a dual-function circuit that concurrently modulates and acquires memristor state information. This is achieved through two key features: 1) a feedback operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuit that ensures precise voltage application on the memristor while converting the passing current into a voltage signal; 2) a division calculation circuit that acquires state information from the modulation voltage and the converted voltage, improving stability by leveraging the intrinsic threshold characteristics of memristors. This circuit has been evaluated in a memristor-based nociceptor and a memristor crossbar, demonstrating exceptional performance. For instance, it achieves mean absolute acquisition errors below 1 {\\Omega} during the modulation process in the nociceptor application. These results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can operate at different scales, holding the potential to enhance a wide range of neuromorphic applications.         ",

The Dirac-like cones that support EMNZ are previously thought to present only at the center of the Brillouin zone ($\\Gamma$ point) with a zero wavevector (we refer to as type-I EMNZ), which is constrained by the proportional relationship between phase refractive index and wavevector ($n=kc/\\omega$). Here, we demonstrate the existence of an anomalous type-II EMNZ in PCs, which is associated with the Dirac-like point at off-$\\Gamma$ points. By introducing a wave modulation approach, we theoretically elucidate its physical mechanism, and resolve the paradox of type-II EMNZ with non-zero wavevectors. We then fabricate a type-II EMNZ PC operating at the X point, and experimentally demonstrate that both its effective permittivity and permeability are zero at the Dirac-like point. Type-II EMNZ PCs exhibit a range of intriguing phenomena, including angle-selective transmission, wavefront flattening, a 180$^{\\circ}$ phase shift upon transmission, and waveguiding with natural zero radiation loss. The extraordinary properties of type-II EMNZ PCs may open new avenues for the development of angle-selective optical filters, directional light sources, phase-controlled optical switches, ultracompact photonic circuits, nanolasers, and on-chip nonlinear enhancement.

It is found that the hysteresis behaviour and the threshold width of the OB can be effectively tuned by varying the incident light wavelength. In addition, the optical bistable behaviour of the structure can be adjusted by varying the position of the MoS2 inset in the defect layer, incident angle and the structural parameters of the spacer layer.

Although the systematic characterization of the first singularities dates back many decades, recent advancements in sub-wavelength wavefront control at optical frequencies have led to a renewed interest in the field, and have substantially expanded the range of known optical singularities and singular structures. However, the diversity in descriptions, mathematical formulations, and naming conventions can create confusion and impede accessibility to the field. This review aims to clarify the nomenclature by demonstrating that any singular field can be conceptualized as a collection of a finite set of principal, 'generic' singularities. These singularities are robust against small perturbations due to their topological nature. We underscore that the control over the principal properties of those singularities, namely, their protection against perturbations and their dimension, utilizes a consistent mathematical framework. Additionally, we provide an overview of current design techniques for both stable and approximate singularities and discuss their applications across various disciplines.         ",

The primary advantage of this model lies in its compatibility with the highly efficient boundary element method (BEM), which includes retardation effects and eliminates the need to incorporate wavevector-dependent permittivity. Furthermore, our approach offers a unified framework that connects two important semiclassical theories: the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory and the Feibelman d-parameters formalism. We envision that QILAM could evolve into a multiscale electrodynamic tool for exploring nonclassical optical responses in diverse plasmonic structures in future.

Here, we contrast the predictions of MQME-D against the numerically exact results obtained by combining hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with a recently reported protocol for monitoring the statistics of the bath. Overall, MQME-D accurately captures the contributions of specific bath components to the overall dissipation while greatly reducing the computational cost as compared to exact computations using HEOM. The computations show that MQME-D exhibits errors originating from its inherent Markov approximation. We demonstrate that its accuracy can be significantly increased by incorporating non-Markovianity by exploiting time scale separations (TSS) in different components of the bath. Our work demonstrates that MQME-D combined with TSS can be reliably used to understanding how energy is dissipated in realistic open quantum system dynamics.         ",

In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum XZ24 algorithm, designed for efficiently computing the eigen-energy spectra of any quantum systems. The algorithm employs an auxiliary qubit as a control qubit to execute a pair of time-reversing real-time evolutions of Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ on the target qubits. The reference state wavefunction $|\\phi_0 \\rangle$ is stored in target qubits. When the control qubit (i.e., the auxiliary qubit) is in the 0 (1) state, the $e^{-i\\hat{H}t/2} (e^{i\\hat{H}t/2})$ evolution operator is applied. By combining Hadamard gates and phase gates on the auxiliary qubit, information about $\\langle \\psi_0 | \\cos(\\hat{H}t) | \\psi_0 \\rangle$ can be obtained from the output auxiliary qubit state. Theoretically, applying the Fourier transformation to the $\\langle \\psi_0 | \\cos(\\hat{H}t) | \\psi_0 \\rangle$ signal can resolve the eigen-energies of the Hamiltonian in the spectrum. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the algorithm, demonstrating its advantages in computational efficiency and accuracy. Compared to existing quantum methods, the new algorithm stands out for its remarkably low measurement cost. For quantum systems of any complexity, only a single auxiliary qubit needs to be measured, resulting in a measurement complexity of $O(1)$. Moreover, this method can simultaneously obtain multiple eigen-energies, dependent on the reference state. We anticipate that the new algorithm will drive significant progress in quantum system simulation and offer promising applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.         ",

However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a ``nonlocal\" pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe$_2$, several microns away from the illumination spot. Remarkably, we identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons' linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results open new avenues for exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.         ",

Advancing the sensors beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations in living cells and multicellular organisms towards reliable, damage-free quantum sensing poses three distinct technical challenges. First, spin-based quantum sensing requires optical accessibility and microwave delivery. Second, any microelectronics must be biocompatible and designed for imaging living specimens. Third, efficient microwave delivery and temperature control are essential to reduce unwanted heating and to maintain an optimal biological environment. Here, we present the Quantum Biosensing Chip (Q-BiC), which facilitates microfluidic-compatible microwave delivery and includes on-chip temperature control. We demonstrate the use of Q-BiC in conjunction with nanodiamonds containing nitrogen vacancy centers to perform optically detected magnetic resonance in living systems. We quantify the biocompatibility of microwave excitation required for optically detected magnetic resonance both in vitro in HeLa cells and in vivo in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for temperature measurements and determine the microwave-exposure range allowed before detrimental effects are observed. In addition, we show that nanoscale quantum thermometry can be performed in immobilised but non-anaesthetised adult nematodes with minimal stress. These results enable the use of spin-based quantum sensors without damaging the biological system under study, facilitating the investigation of the local thermodynamic and viscoelastic properties of intracellular processes.

However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.         ",

It has been previously shown that, if the nanoparticles are distributed periodically, an additional enhancement can be achieved by coupling the localized surface plasmons to the diffraction orders of the lattice, forming surface lattice resonances. In this work, we study an even further improvement of the near-field enhancement by placing a metal-dielectric slab waveguide beneath the lattice of the particles to excite coupled waveguide-plasmon polaritons. These excitations can extend over many periods of the lattice, making the metasurface highly nonlocal. We numerically demonstrate that the approach can provide a significant extra increase in the near-field intensity -- by a factor of 80 over that produced by a single-particle plasmon resonance and by 7 over the lattice-resonance enhancement. The described enhancement mechanism can be used to design extraordinarily efficient nonlocal optical metasurfaces for many applications, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and solar energy harvesting.

Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.         ",

Here, we address one of the key questions of this research: can an optical wave be amplified by a slowly modulated realistic photonic circuit? To solve this problem, we investigate the propagation of light with an initial phase velocity $v_0$ and frequency $\\omega_0$ propagating through an optical waveguide and resonator modulated by a traveling wave with phase velocity $v_p$ and low frequency $\\omega_p << \\omega_0$. Close to the synchronous condition, $v_p =v_0$, the modulation effects can significantly grow. Consequently, the bandwidth of the optical frequency comb spectrum can be dramatically enhanced by a synchronous traveling wave with $v_p \\approx v_0$ compared to the bandwidth generated by an instantaneous wave with $v_p=\\infty$. However, for realistic optical waveguides, the light amplification remains small due to its essentially broadband character. In contrast, we show that the modulation of a racetrack optical resonator by a traveling wave with a small phase velocity $v_p <<v_0$ (rather than with synchronous $v_p\\approx v_0$) can significantly amplify light remaining within a relatively small bandwidth.

    "abstract": "           Recent study has demonstrated that electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can be excited by a low energy electron beam. Such waves propagate at moderately oblique wave normal angles (~70). The potential effects of beam-driven ECH waves on electron dynamics in Earth's plasma sheet is not known. Using two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell simulations with initial electron distributions that represent typical plasma conditions in the plasma sheet, we explore the excitation and saturation of such beam-driven ECH waves. Both ECH and electron acoustic waves are excited in the simulation and propagate at oblique wave normal angles. Compared with the electron acoustic waves, ECH waves grow much faster and have more intense saturation amplitudes. Cold, stationary electrons are first accelerated by ECH waves through cyclotron resonance and then accelerated in the parallel direction by both the ECH and electron acoustic waves through Landau resonance. Beam electrons, on the other hand, are decelerated in the parallel direction and scattered to larger pitch angles. The relaxation of the electron beam and the continuous heating of the cold electrons contribute to ECH wave saturation and suppress the excitation of electron acoustic waves. When the ratio of plasma to electron cyclotron frequency wpe/wce increases, the ECH wave amplitude increases while the electron acoustic wave amplitude decreases. Our work reveals the importance of ECH and electron acoustic waves in reshaping sub-thermal electron distributions and improves our understanding on the potential effects of wave-particle interactions in trapping ionospheric electron outflows and forming anisotropic (field-aligned) electron distributions in the plasma sheet.

By analyzing the asymptotic time response of the system, the theory demonstrates that the Alfv\u00e9n resonance is due to the residues at the resonant poles, in the complex frequency plane, introduced by the boundary perturbation.

While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.         ",

    "title": "Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction",
    "abstract": "           Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.

    "abstract": "           In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.         ",

    "title": "Tripartite quantum Rabi model with trapped Rydberg ions",
    "abstract": "           We investigate a tripartite quantum Rabi model (TQRM) wherein a bosonic mode concurrently couples to two spin-$1/2$ particles through a spin-spin interaction, resulting in a spin-spin-boson coupling -- a departure from conventional quantum Rabi models featuring bipartite spin-boson couplings. The symmetries of the TQRM depend on the detuning parameter, representing the energy difference between the spin states. At zero detuning a parity symmetry renders the TQRM reducible to a quantum Rabi model. A subradiant to superradiant transition in the groundstate is predicted as the tripartite coupling strength increases. For non-zero detuning the total spin emerges as the sole conserved quantity in the TQRM. It is found that superradiance prevails in the groundstate as long as the tripartite coupling remains non-zero. We derive the Braak $\\mathcal{G}$-function of the TQRM analytically, with which the eigenspectra are obtained. The TQRM can be realized in a viable trapped Rydberg ion quantum simulator, where the required tripartite couplings and single body interactions in the TQRM are naturally present. Our study opens opportunities to explore and create novel correlations and entanglement in the spin and motional degrees of freedoms with the TQRM.         ",

    "abstract": "           Vacuum polarization (VP) is investigated for the interaction of a polarized $\\gamma$-ray beam of GeV photons with a counterpropagating ultraintense laser pulse. In a conventional setup of a vacuum birefringence measurement, a VP signal is the emerging small circular (linear) polarization of the initially linearly (circularly) polarized probe photons. The pair production via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in such a high-energy environment eliminates part of the $\\gamma$-photons in the outgoing $\\gamma$-beam, increasing the statistical error and decreasing the accuracy of this VP signal. In contrast, we investigate the conversion of the emerging circular polarization of $\\gamma$-photons into longitudinal polarization of the created positrons, considering the latter as the main VP signal. To study the VP effects in the highly nonlinear regime, where the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian method breaks down, we have developed a Monte-Carlo simulation method, incorporating vacuum birefringence and dichroism via the one-loop QED probabilities in the locally constant field approximation. Our Monte Carlo method will enable the study of VP effects in strong fields of arbitrary configuration. With 10~PW laser systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the fermionic signal of the VP effect at the 5$\\sigma$ confidence level with a few hours of measurement time.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic integrated circuits are emerging as a promising platform for accelerating matrix multiplications in deep learning, leveraging the inherent parallel nature of light. Although various schemes have been proposed and demonstrated to realize such photonic matrix accelerators, the in-situ training of artificial neural networks using photonic accelerators remains challenging due to the difficulty of direct on-chip backpropagation on a photonic chip. In this work, we propose a silicon microring resonator (MRR) optical crossbar array with a symmetric structure that allows for simple on-chip backpropagation, potentially enabling the acceleration of both the inference and training phases of deep learning. We demonstrate a $4 \\times 4$ circuit on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and use it to perform inference tasks of a simple neural network for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Subsequently, we train the neural network using simulated on-chip backpropagation and achieve an accuracy of 91.1% in the same inference task after training. Furthermore, we simulate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, using a $9 \\times 9$ MRR crossbar array to perform the convolution operations. This work contributes to the realization of compact and energy-efficient photonic accelerators for deep learning.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we investigate the possibility of explaining nonclassical correlations between two quantum systems in terms of quantum interferences between collective states of the two systems. We achieve this by mapping the relations between different measurement contexts in the product Hilbert space of a pair of two-level systems onto an analogous sequence of interferences between paths in a single-particle interferometer. The relations between different measurement outcomes are then traced to the distribution of probability currents in the interferometer, where paradoxical relations between the outcomes are identified with currents connecting two states that are orthogonal and should therefore exclude each other. We show that the relation between probability currents and correlations can be represented by continuous conditional (quasi)probability currents through the interferometer, given by weak values; the violation of the noncontextual assumption is expressed by negative conditional currents in some of the paths. Since negative conditional currents correspond to the assignment of negative conditional probabilities to measurements results in different measurement contexts, the necessity of such negative probability currents represents a failure of noncontextual local realism. Our results help to explain the meaning of nonlocal correlations in quantum mechanics, and support Feynman's claim that interference is the origin of all quantum phenomena.         ",
