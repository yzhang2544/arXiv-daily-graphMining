    "abstract": "           We consider scattering of light by light in Very Special Relativity (VSR) Quantum Electrodynamics(QED) with a non-zero photon mass. In order to preserve gauge invariance and Sim(2) symmetry we made use of a recently introduced infrared regularization of VSR theories. Additionally we show that all one loop diagrams with any number of photon external legs and zero fermion legs reduce to the standard QED result with the effective electron mass, as required by unitarity. It follows that the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian is the same as in QED. The total cross section of scattering of light by light exhibits tiny anisotropies that could be detected at cosmological scales. In particular they should be looked at the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) Radiation for low photon frequencies.         ",

    "abstract": "           All optical systems, which involve the collimation of a reflected, transmitted or scattered wave subsequent to tight focusing, are subject to two kinds of deviations. One is the wavefront curvature due to inaccurate focal placement of the interface or scatterer particle under consideration, and the other is the diffraction caused by the finite lens aperture. In the present paper we explore these phenomena in detail by considering a rigorous simulated model and an appropriate experimental setup. We hence demonstrate the complicated intensity profiles and optical singularity characteristics of the observed far field. Then we describe ways to minimize these deviations in a general experiment. But more importantly, our analysis proves that these deviations by themselves are significant optical phenomena of fundamental interest. The observed complex field profiles have similarities to standard diffraction-limited tight focal fields, though our field detection is different from the standard schemes. This indicates the relevance of these complex fields to a larger class of systems involving wavefront curvature and aperture diffraction. The detailed analysis and results of the present paper already serve as core explorations of these optical phenomena; and we also suggest future research directions where these system aspects can be purposefully created and explored further.

    "abstract": "           Motivated by experiments employing ps-long, kilojoule laser pulses, we examined x-ray emission in a finite-length underdense plasma irradiated by such a pulse using two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We found that, in addition to the expected forward emission, the plasma also efficiently emits in the backward direction. Our simulations reveal that the backward emission occurs when the laser exits the plasma. The longitudinal plasma electric field generated by the laser at the density down-ramp turns around some of the laser-accelerated electrons and re-accelerates them in the backward direction. As the electrons collide with the laser, they emit hard x-rays. The energy conversion efficiency is comparable to that for the forward emission, but the effective source size is smaller. We show that the ps laser duration is required for achieving a spatial overlap between the laser and the backward energetic electrons. At peak laser intensity of $1.4\\times 10^{20}~\\rm{W/cm^2}$, backward emitted photons (energies above 100~keV and $10^{\\circ}$ divergence angle) account for $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ of the incident laser energy. This conversion efficiency is three times higher than that for similarly selected forward emitted photons. The source size of the backward photons ($5~\\rm{\\mu m}$) is three times smaller than the source size of the forward photons.         ",

Over the propagation distances relevant to many experiments, dispersion causes the relative phase between the harmonics to evolve. This \"dephasing\" slows the accumulation of THz energy and results in a multi-cycle THz pulse with significant angular dispersion. Here, we introduce a novel optical configuration that compensates the relative phase evolution, allowing for the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with almost no angular dispersion. The configuration uses the spherical aberration of an axilens to map a prescribed radial phase variation in the near field to a desired longitudinal phase variation in the far field. Simulations that combine this configuration with an ultrashort flying focus demonstrate the formation of a half-cycle THz pulse with a controlled emission angle and 1/4 the angular divergence of the multi-cycle pulse created by a conventional optical configuration.

    "abstract": "           Optomechanical crystal cavities (OMCCs) allow the interaction between localized optical and mechanical modes through the radiation-pressure force. Driving such cavities with blue-detuned lasers relative to the optical resonance can induce a phonon lasing regime where the OMCC supports self-sustained mechanical oscillations. This dynamic state results in a narrow and stable microwave tone that modulates the laser at integer multiples of the mechanical resonance frequency, ultimately creating an optomechanical (OM) frequency comb suitable for microwave photonics applications. OMCCs enable compact, low-cost power-efficient all-photonic processing of multiple microwave signals, crucial for current 5G and future beyond-5G systems, whilst being compatible with silicon integrated photonic circuits. This work reports the experimental demonstration of all-optical multi-frequency up- and down-conversion of 3GPP 5G new-radio (NR) signals from the low- to mid- and extended-mid bands using the first and second harmonics of the frequency comb generated in a silicon OMCC. The OM comb generates up to 6 harmonics in the K-band, which is suitable for microwave photonic applications. The experimental demonstration also evaluates the impact of the phase-noise and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the frequency-converted 5G NR signals when the first and second OMCC harmonics are employed for frequency conversion.

This is marking an end to Moore's law, which calls for a new computing paradigm: Quantum computing is a prime candidate. In this paper, we offer a perspective on the current challenges that need to be overcome in order to use quantum computing for the simulation of nonlinear dynamics. We review and discuss progress in the development of both quantum algorithms for nonlinear equations and quantum hardware.

    "abstract": "           Transparent conducting oxides are highly doped semiconductors that exhibit favourable characteristics when compared to metals, including reduced material losses, tuneable electronic and optical properties, and enhanced damage thresholds. Recently, the photonic community has renewed its attention towards these materials, recognizing their remarkable nonlinear optical properties in the near-infrared spectrum, a feature previously overlooked despite their long-standing application in photovoltaics and touchscreens. The exceptionally large and ultra-fast change of the refractive index, which can be optically induced in these compounds, extends beyond the boundaries of conventional perturbative analysis and makes this class of materials the closest approximation to a time-varying system, and a unique playground for studying a variety of novel phenomena within the domain of photon acceleration. Here we report the spatio-spectral fission of an ultra-fast pulse trespassing a thin film of aluminium zinc oxide with a non-stationary refractive index. By applying phase conservation to this time-varying layer, our model can account for both space and time refraction and explain in quantitative terms, the spatial separation of both the spectrum and energy. Our findings represent an example of extreme nonlinear phenomena on subwavelength propagation distances and shed light on the nature of several nonlinear effects recently reported not accounting for the full optical field distribution. Our work also provides new important insights into transparent conducting oxides transient optical properties which are critical for the ongoing research in photonic time crystals, on-chip generation of nonclassical states of light, integrated optical neural networks as well as ultra-fast beam steering and frequency division multiplexing         ",

Here we present a computational investigation of a novel technique for attosecond optical sensing through time correlation transduction (TCT) by investigating high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a representative SF-QED process. TCT is an experimental method to capture photon-electron interactions at higher harmonic orders by temporarily correlating the emitted and driving photon fields. This approach enables resolving the dynamical behavior of optically-driven strong-field phenomena in quantum materials such as Two-dimensional Materials and Dirac Semimetals down to 10 attosecond temporal resolution to discover a full quantum explanation. Predicting and measuring the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regimes with attosecond resolution can deepen the understanding of SF-QED such as HHG. As such, we find that TCT is a powerful method to pave the way toward the functional characterization of quantum matter.         ",

This study not only extends the VQE algorithm to the relativistic regime, but also calculates a property other than energy, namely the molecular permanent electric dipole moment (PDM). We carry out 18-qubit quantum simulations to obtain ground state energies as well as PDMs of single-valence diatomic molecules, ranging from the light BeH to the heavy radioactive RaH molecule. We investigate the correlation trends in these systems as well as access the precision in our results. Furthermore, we measure the PDM of the moderately heavy SrH and SrF molecules on the optimized unitary coupled cluster state, using the state-of-the-art IonQ Aria-I quantum computer in an active space of 6 qubits. The associated quantum circuits for these computations were extensively optimized in view of limitations imposed by NISQ hardware. To that end, we employ an array of techniques, including the use of point group symmetries, integrating ZX-Calculus into our pipeline-based circuit optimization, and energy sort VQE procedure. Through these methods, we compress our 6-qubit quantum circuit from 280 two-qubit gates to 37 two-qubit gates (with a marginal trade-off of 0.33 and 0.31 percent in the PDM for SrH and SrF in their respective 6-spin orbital active spaces).

    "abstract": "           The quantum eraser effect exemplifies the distinct properties of quantum mechanics that challenge classical intuition and expose the wave-particle duality of light. This effect has been extensively explored in various experiments; most of these investigations use polarisation to distinguish which path information, and less attention has been paid to the phase structure which is related wavefront of photon. In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework for quantum erasure that focusses on the phase structure and demonstrate it experimentally. In this experiment, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) where a first-order spiral phase plate (SPP) is integrated into one of its arms. This setup applied orbital angular momentum (OAM) to the photons and established predetermined which-way information. Consequently, the photon demonstrates its particle characteristics, with absence of interference at the MZI's output ports. Utilizing an additional SPP to erase the phase structure from the output photon results in pronounced interference patterns, observable in a post-measurement scenario. This result allows us to include the structure information of the equiphase plane of the light field in quantum erasure. The results challenge the traditional cause-effect relationship in classical physics, given that the subsequent choice of the SPP adheres to a space-like separation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cosmic ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles' orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly towards the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR back-reaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our novel fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward and backward propagating Alfv\u00e9n and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a fundamental revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Quantum correction of the channel itself is therefore required, but break-even performance -- where arbitrary states can be better transmitted through a corrected channel than an uncorrected one -- has so far remained out of reach. Here we perform distillation by heralded amplification to improve a noisy entanglement channel. We subsequently employ entanglement swapping to demonstrate that arbitrary quantum information transmission is unconditionally improved -- i.e. without relying on postselection or post-processing of data -- compared to the uncorrected channel. In this way, it represents realisation of a genuine quantum relay. Our channel correction for single-mode quantum states will find use in quantum repeater, communication and metrology applications.         ",

Feyerabend's work in philosophy of physics and of science more generally for insights that could be useful for the contemporary debate on the foundations of quantum mechanics. We take as our starting point what Feyerabend has actually written about quantum mechanics, but we extend our analysis to his general views on realism, objectivity, pluralism, and the relation between physics and philosophy, finding that these more general views could in fact offer many interesting insights for physicists and philosophers working on quantum foundations.

    "title": "Autoregressive Transformer Neural Network for Simulating Open Quantum Systems via a Probabilistic Formulation",
    "abstract": "           The theory of open quantum systems lays the foundations for a substantial part of modern research in quantum science and engineering. Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM), we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive transformer neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of String States to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive transformer neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our work provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.

    "abstract": "           Absolute angular rotation rate measurements with sensitivity better than prad/s would be beneficial for fundamental science investigations. On this regard, large frame Earth based ring laser gyroscopes are top instrumentation as far as bandwidth, long--term operation, and sensitivity are concerned. Here, we demonstrate that the GINGERINO active--ring laser upper limiting noise is close to $2 \\times 10^{-15}$ rad/s for $\\sim 2 \\times 10^5$ s of integration time, as estimated by the Allan deviation evaluated in a differential measurement scheme. This is more than a factor 10 better than the theoretical prediction so far accounted for ideal ring lasers shot--noise with the two beams counter--propagating inside the cavity considered as two independent propagating modes. This feature is related to the peculiarity of real ring laser system dynamics that causes phase cross--talking among the two counter--propagating modes. In this context, the independent beam model is, then, not applicable and the measured noise limit falls below the expected one.         ",

Among these phenomena, we find fluid flows described by the Navier-Stokes equations. We develop a quantum algorithm that allows for the simulation of fluid dynamic LGCA on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we prove the conservation of the quantities of interest, but finding more quantum invariants than expected. Finally, we develop a phase estimation procedure for detecting quantities of interest such as mass and momentum, avoiding reinitialization of the cell. In addition, we discuss a sublinear encoding of the lattice which admits a unitary streaming but constrains the collision step.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.         ",

Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.         ",
