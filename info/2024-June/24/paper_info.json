    "title": "Deep-Learning Approach for Tissue Classification using Acoustic Waves during Ablation with an Er:YAG Laser (Updated)",
    "abstract": "           Today's mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers aim to minimize this trauma, with minimally invasive surgery using laser cutting as one innovation. This method ablates tissue using laser light instead of mechanical tools, reducing post-surgery healing time. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. We propose a tissue classification method analyzing acoustic waves generated during laser ablation, demonstrating its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, acquired with an air-coupled transducer. These waves were used to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or principal components of the frequency spectrum as input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as input. Consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve classification accuracy. Grad-Cam identified the activation map of the frequencies, showing low frequencies as the most important for this task. Our results indicated that combining time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum achieved the highest classification accuracy (65.5%-75.5%). We also found that using the frequency spectrum alone was sufficient, with no additional benefit from applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent studies in vitro and in vivo suggest that flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) on its own might be able to act as a biological magnetic field sensor. Motivated by these observations, in this study, we develop a detailed quantum theoretical model for the radical pair mechanism (RPM) for the flavin adenine biradical within the FAD molecule. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the distance between the radicals on FAD, which we then feed into a quantum master equation treatment of the RPM. In contrast to previous semi-classical models which are limited to the low-field and high-field cases, our quantum model can predict the full magnetic field dependence of the transient absorption signal. Our model's predictions are consistent with experiments.         ",

An array of reconfigurable dipoeles can generate on demand far field patterns of radiation through the specific encoding of meta atomic states. i.e., the configuration of each dipole. Suitable states for the generation of the desired patterns can be identified using iteartion, but this is very slow and needs to be done for each far field pattern. Here, we present a deep learning based method for the control of a metasurface antenna with point dipole elements that vary in their state using dipole polarizability. Instead of iteration, we adopt a deep learning algorithm that combines an autoencoder with an electromagnetic scattering equation to determin the states required for a target far field pattern in real time. The scattering equation from Born approximation is used as the decoder in training the neural network, and analytic Green's function calculation is used to check the validity of Born approximation. Our learning based algorithm requires a computing time of within in 200 microseconds to determine the meta atomic states, thus enabling the real time opeartion of a holographic antenna.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cavity electrodynamics offers a unique avenue for tailoring ground-state material properties, excited-state engineering, and versatile control of quantum matter. Merging these concepts with high-field physics in the terahertz (THz) spectral range opens the door to explore low-energy, field-driven cavity electrodynamics, emerging from fundamental resonances or order parameters. Despite this demand, leveraging the full potential of field-driven material control in cavities is hindered by the lack of direct access to the intra-cavity fields. Here, we demonstrate a new concept of active cavities, consisting of electro-optic Fabry-Perot resonators, which measure their intra-cavity electric fields on sub-cycle timescales. We thereby demonstrate quantitative retrieval of the cavity modes in amplitude and phase, over a broad THz frequency range. To enable simultaneous intra-cavity sampling alongside excited-state material control, we design a tunable multi-layer cavity, enabling deterministic design of hybrid cavities for polaritonic systems. Our theoretical models reveal the origin of the avoided crossings embedded in the intricate mode dispersion, and will enable fully-switchable polaritonic effects within arbitrary materials hosted by the hybrid cavity. Electro-optic cavities (EOCs) will therefore serve as integrated probes of light-matter interactions across all coupling regimes, laying the foundation for field-resolved intra-cavity quantum electrodynamics.

Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\u00e9n waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\u00e9n waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\u00e9n velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\u00e9n-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\u00e9n waves are present.         ",

    "abstract": "           As a biomarker for liver disease, bilirubin has been utilized in prognostic scoring systems for cirrhosis. While laboratory-based methods are used to determine bilirubin levels in clinical settings, they do not readily lend themselves to applications outside of hospitals. Consequently, bilirubin monitoring for cirrhotic patients is often performed only intermittently; thus, episodes requiring clinical interventions could be missed. This work investigates the feasibility of measuring bilirubin concentration in whole porcine blood samples using dual-wavelength transmission measurement. A compact and low-cost dual-wavelength transmission measurement setup is developed and optimized to measure whole blood bilirubin concentrations. Using small volumes of whole porcine blood (72 {\\mu}L), we measured the bilirubin concentration within a range corresponding to healthy individuals and cirrhotic patients (1.2-30 mg/dL). We demonstrate that bilirubin levels can be estimated with a positive correlation (R-square > 0.95) and an accuracy of +/- 1.7 mg/dL, with higher reliability in cirrhotic bilirubin concentrations (> 4 mg/dL), critical for high-risk patients. The optical and electronic components utilized are economical and can be readily integrated into a miniature, low-cost, and user-friendly system. This could provide a pathway for point-of-care monitoring of blood bilirubin outside of medical facilities.         ",

Especially isolated attosecond pulses with high photon energy and high peak power are of great significance in single-shot imaging in the soft x-ray region, life sciences, and attosecond pump-probe experiments. In modern accelerators, laser manipulation of electrons can be used to tailor the ultrafast properties of free-electron laser (FEL) pulses. In this paper, we propose a novel laser manipulation technique that makes use of two laser beams with mutual delays and tilted wavefronts to synthesize microbunching rotation on the scale of infrared laser wavelengths within the electron bunch for generating isolated attosecond soft x-ray pulses. This microbunching rotation ultimately leads to an enhanced current contrast ratio between the main peak and the surrounding satellite peaks within the bunch. By properly accounting for the longitudinal space charge fields within the FEL undulator, a tapered undulator can further suppress the side peaks in the radiation pulse and enable the selection of an isolated, hundred-attosecond, GW-level soft x-ray pulse.

The time reflection and transmission coefficients are shown to be identical to so-called reverse-space reflection and transmission coefficients which appear in the recursive computation of focusing wavefields used in seismology. We establish a bijectivity between the focusing wavefields and the wavefields produced by time scattering and show how this can be used to construct a space-time medium where the time scattering anticipates the space scattering and \"computes\" the exact inverse for the space scattering. The construction is shown to be independent of the boundary conditions chosen to compute the reflection and transmission coefficients. We demonstrate the construction with a simple numerical example of a single pulse encountering a series of time boundaries before reaching a spatial inhomogeneity. The time boundaries scatter the single pulse into a focusing wavefield that subsequently focuses through the spatial inhomogeneity. Under certain conditions, the transmitted wave has both the same wave shape and amplitude as the original pulse, yielding a transmission coefficient of unity. The reflection coefficient of the space-time medium is always non-zero however.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum computers currently rely on a hybrid quantum-classical approach known as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to solve problems. Still, there are several challenges with VQAs on the classical computing side: it corresponds to a black-box optimization problem that is generally non-convex, the observations from the quantum hardware are noisy, and the quantum computing time is expensive. The first point is inherent to the problem structure; as a result, it requires the classical part of VQAs to be solved using global optimization strategies. However, there is a trade-off between cost and accuracy; typically, quantum computers return a set of bit strings, where each bitstring is referred to as a shot. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing (QC) necessitates many shots to measure the circuit accurately. Since QC time is charged per shot, reducing the number of shots yields cheaper and less accurate observations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using basic Bayesian optimization (BO) methods to globally optimize quantum circuit parameters. This work proposes two modifications to the basic BO framework to provide a shot-efficient optimization strategy for VQAs. Specifically, we provide a means to place a prior on the periodicity of the rotation angles and a framework to place a topological prior using few-shot quantum circuit observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through an ablation study, showing that using both proposed features statistically outperforms a standard BO implementation within VQAs for computational chemistry simulations.

Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.

    "abstract": "           In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.         ",

    "title": "A Nanocryotron Ripple Counter Integrated with a Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detector for Megapixel Arrays",
    "abstract": "           Decreasing the number of cables that bring heat into the cryostat is a critical issue for all cryoelectronic devices. Especially, arrays of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) could require more than $10^6$ readout lines. Performing signal processing operations at low temperatures could be a solution. Nanocryotrons, superconducting nanowire three-terminal devices, are good candidates for integrating sensing and electronics on the same technological platform as SNSPDs in photon-counting applications. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to read out, process, encode, and store the output of SNSPDs using exclusively superconducting nanowires. In particular, we present the design and development of a nanocryotron ripple counter that detects input voltage spikes and converts the number of pulses to an $N$-digit value. The counting base can be tuned from 2 to higher values, enabling higher maximum counts without enlarging the circuit. As a proof-of-principle, we first experimentally demonstrated the building block of the counter, an integer-$N$ frequency divider with $N$ ranging from 2 to 5. Then, we demonstrated photon-counting operations at 405 nm and 1550 nm by coupling an SNSPD with a 2-digit nanocryotron counter partially integrated on-chip. The 2-digit counter could operate in either base 2 or base 3 with a bit error rate lower than $2 \\times 10^{-4}$ and a count rate of $10^7\\,$s$^{-1}$. We simulated circuit architectures for integrated readout of the counter state, and we evaluated the capabilities of reading out an SNSPD megapixel array that would collect up to $10^{12}$ counts per second. The results of this work, combined with our recent publications on a nanocryotron shift register and logic gates, pave the way for the development of nanocryotron processors, from which multiple superconducting platforms may benefit.

    "abstract": "           Diamond has superlative material properties for a broad range of quantum and electronic technologies. However, heteroepitaxial growth of single crystal diamond remains limited, impeding integration and evolution of diamond-based technologies. Here, we directly bond single-crystal diamond membranes to a wide variety of materials including silicon, fused silica, sapphire, thermal oxide, and lithium niobate. Our bonding process combines customized membrane synthesis, transfer, and dry surface functionalization, allowing for minimal contamination while providing pathways for near unity yield and scalability. We generate bonded crystalline membranes with thickness as low as 10 nm, sub-nm interfacial regions, and nanometer-scale thickness variability over 200 by 200 $\\mu m^2$ areas. We measure spin coherence times $T_2$ for nitrogen-vacancy centers in bonded membranes of up to 623(21) $\\mu$s, suitable for advanced quantum applications. We demonstrate multiple methods for integrating high quality factor nanophotonic cavities with the diamond heterostructures, highlighting the platform versatility in quantum photonic applications. Furthermore, we show that our ultra-thin diamond membranes are compatible with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which enables interfacing coherent diamond quantum sensors with living cells while rejecting unwanted background luminescence. The processes demonstrated herein provide a full toolkit to synthesize heterogeneous diamond-based hybrid systems for quantum and electronic technologies.         ",

The ASIC contains a matrix of 100 \\mu m pitch hexagonal pixels, readout out by low noise and very fast frontend electronics produced in a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology process. The dependence on the proton fluence of the efficiency and the time resolution of this prototype was measured with the frontend electronics operated at a power density between 0.13 and 0.9 W/cm2. The testbeam data show that the detection efficiency of 99.96% measured at sensor bias voltage of 200 V before irradiation becomes 96.2% after a fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2. An increase of the sensor bias voltage to 300 V provides an efficiency to 99.7% at that proton fluence. The timing resolution of 20 ps measured before irradiation rises for a proton fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2 to 53 and 45 ps at HV = 200 and 300 V, respectively.         ",

    "abstract": "           The impact of the expansion of a high-frequency radar (HFR) system in a dynamic coastal area (the Ibiza Channel in the Western Mediterranean Sea) is evaluated through an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The installation of two new antennas in the Iberian Peninsula would complement the existing ones in the islands of Ibiza and Formentera, providing surface currents observations of the full channel. Two different configurations of the same model, validated to give realistic simulations, are used: i) a Nature Run (NR) which is considered as the real ocean state and that is used to generate pseudo-observations, and ii) a Control Run (CR) in which the pseudo-observations are assimilated. The OSSE is first validated by comparison against a previous Observing System Experiment (OSE). The impact of the new antennas for forecasting surface currents is evaluated in two different periods with different levels of agreement between NR and CR. The HFR expansion is found to contribute to significantly correct the circulation patterns in the Channel, leading to surface merdional velocity error reductions up to 19%. The effects on the transport in the area are also analyzed from a Lagrangian perspective, showing that DA can help to better represent the Lagrangian Coherent Structures present in the NR and constrain the ocean dynamics.

    "abstract": "           Atomic clocks have been at the leading edge of accuracy and precision since their inception in the 1950s. However, typically the most capable of these clocks have been confined to laboratories despite the fact that there are compelling reasons to apply them in the field and/or while in motion. These applications include synchronization of distributed critical infrastructure (e.g. data servers, communications, electricity grids), scientific applications (e.g. radio-astronomy) and to mitigate the effects of interruption to Global Navigation Satellite Systems. Over the last 20 years, there has been a breakthrough in the performance of atomic clocks by transitioning from an atomic reference based on a microwave transition to an optical frequency transition. The $10^5$-fold increase in reference frequency confers the potential for significantly higher performance. However, this performance increase has come at the cost of size, complexity and fragility which has continued the confinement of these clocks to the laboratory. Here we report on a recent international collaboration where three emerging optical clocks, each operating on different principles, were trialed at sea. These clocks incorporate optical frequency combs so that their stable frequency outputs can be used directly in electronic apparatus and were also automated so that they do not require expert supervision. We present the frequency stability and reliability of these three clocks over multiple weeks of unsupervised naval trials, both in harbour and on the ocean. The performance of all three devices was orders of magnitude superior to existing best-in-class commercial solutions over short and medium timescales. This demonstrates that optical clocks are ready to deliver advantages for real-world applications.         ",

We formulate this problem in a realistic setting and derive quantum-mechanical limits on Alice's error probability performance in entanglement-assisted target detection for any fixed level of her detectability by Willie. We demonstrate how Alice can approach this performance limit using two-mode squeezed vacuum probes in the regime of small to moderate background brightness, and how such protocols can outperform any conventional approach using Gaussian-distributed coherent states.

However, it remains a challenging task to efficiently trap a large ensemble of cold atoms on an integrated nanophotonic circuit. Here, we demonstrate direct loading of an ensemble of up to 70 atoms into an optical microtrap on a nanophotonic microring circuit. Efficient trap loading is achieved by employing degenerate Raman-sideband cooling in the microtrap, where a built-in spin-motion coupling arises directly from the vector light shift of the evanescent field potential on a microring. Atoms are cooled into the trap via optical pumping with a single free space beam. We have achieved a trap lifetime approaching 700ms under continuous cooling. We show that the trapped atoms display large cooperative coupling and superradiant decay into a whispering-gallery mode of the microring resonator, holding promise for explorations of new collective effects. Our technique can be extended to trapping a large ensemble of cold atoms on nanophotonic circuits for various quantum applications.         ",
