    "abstract": "           Topological transformations of dielectric structures radically change the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of photonic resonances. Moreover, optical effects may arise that characterize the moment of transition from one structure to another, but are not inherent in either the initial or final structure. We demonstrate that such a hallmark of the disk-ring transition is a hot spot of a special nature that arises at the moment a central hole appears in the disk. The hot spot in the air hole is caused by the Mie resonance of the disk with azimuthal number $m$ = 1, while other Mie resonances do not contribute to the effect due to symmetry. As the hole increases, the hot spot fades out, and we theoretically and experimentally observe the formation of photonic resonances of the ring from resonances of the disk. Using near-field and far-field measurements, we discovered clustering of disk photonic modes into distinct galleries of ring eigenmodes that are formed by the inner and outer walls of the cavity. Thus, we demonstrate both the beginning and the end of the rearrangement of photonic eigenmodes during the transition from a dielectric disk to a narrow ring.         ",

    "abstract": "           Modern diesel engines temporarily use a very late post-injection in the combustion cycle to either generate heat for a diesel particulate filter regeneration or purge a lean NOx trap. In some configurations, unburned fuel is left at the cylinder walls and is transported via the piston rings toward the lower crankcase region, where fuel may dilute the oil. Reduced oil lubrication shortens the oil service intervals and increases friction. Beside diesel fuel, this problem may also occur for other types of liquid fuels such as alcohols and e-fuels. The exact transport mechanism of the unburned fuel via the piston ring pack grooves and cylinder wall is hard to measure experimentally, motivating numerical flow simulation in early design stages for an in-depth understanding of the involved processes. A new CFD simulation methodology has been developed to investigate the transient, compressible, multiphase flow around the piston ring pack, through the gap between piston and liner, and its impact on fuel or oil transport. The modern level-set approach is used for the multiphase physics, which directly captures the sharp interface between blow-by gas and fuel or oil. Transient blow-by and two-phase flow simulations have been extensively applied to a Ford 2.0L I4 diesel test engine. The results confirm the validity of the flow compressibility assumption and highlight the sensitivity of the fuel leakage regarding piston sealing ring movement and highly resolved meshes for the multiphase flow. Based on the simulation results, design recommendations for piston and piston ring geometry are provided to reduce the fuel transport toward the crankcase.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present EngineBench, the first machine learning (ML) oriented database to use high quality experimental data for the study of turbulent flows inside combustion machinery. Prior datasets for ML in fluid mechanics are synthetic or use overly simplistic geometries. EngineBench is comprised of real-world particle image velocimetry (PIV) data that captures the turbulent airflow patterns in a specially-designed optical engine. However, in PIV data from internal flows, such as from engines, it is often challenging to achieve a full field of view and large occlusions can be present. In order to design optimal combustion systems, insight into the turbulent flows in these obscured areas is needed, which can be provided via inpainting models. Here we propose a novel inpainting task using random edge gaps, a technique that emphasises realism by introducing occlusions at random sizes and orientations at the edges of the PIV images. We test five ML methods on random edge gaps using pixel-wise, vector-based, and multi-scale performance metrics. We find that UNet-based models are more accurate than the industry-norm non-parametric approach and the context encoder at this task on both small and large gap sizes. The dataset and inpainting task presented in this paper support the development of more general-purpose pre-trained ML models for engine design problems. The method comparisons allow for more informed selection of ML models for problems in experimental flow diagnostics. All data and code are publicly available at this https URL.         ",

Here we demonstrate a novel crossed ODT design that features inherent stability of the beam crossing, allowing the trap to move and remain aligned. The trap consists of a single high-power laser beam, imaged back onto itself at an angle to form a crossed trap. Self-aligning behavior results from employing an imaging system with positive magnification tuned precisely to unity. We employ laser-cooled samples of $^6$Li atoms to demonstrate that the trap remains well-aligned over a 4.3 mm travel range along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane containing the crossed beams. Our scheme can be applied to bring an atomic cloud held in a crossed ODT close to a surface or field source for various applications in quantum simulation, sensing, and information processing.

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries.

The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.
