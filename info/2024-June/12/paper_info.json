    "abstract": "           The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall noise performance, first we extended the available {\\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.         ",

We overcome geometric constraints by making use of the extended nature of the mechanical resonator normal modes, which allows us to spatially separate the scanning and readout sites of the membrane.

This paper presents a novel high-energy electron cyclotron resonance ion beam sputter deposition technique to fabricate pure diamond-like carbon coatings at room temperature. The chemical composition of the deposited coatings including ratios of sp2/sp3 bonding in the thin films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results indicate that the sp3 percentage ranges from 45% - 85%. The transmission and reflectance spectra of the coatings were measured from UV to IR ({\\lambda}= 185 to 2500 nm) by utilizing a spectrophotometer. The measured spectra were analysed by the Tauc method to determine the optical band gap and Urbach energy and an optical fitting software, which utilizes the model modified by OJL, to extract the refractive index and extinction coefficient. By varying the ion energy, the optical properties were found to be n = 2.30 - 2.51, band gap energy = 0.4 - 0.68 eV, and the Urbach energy = 0.33 - 0.49 eV. This study provides a flexible method for tuning the structural, optical, and electronic properties of diamond-like carbon coatings by controlling the ion energy during deposition.         ",

To this end, we employ expanding the exponential cluster operator using Chebyshev polynomials and introduce two methods: the Chebyshev approximated VCC (C$^d$-VCC) and the Hermitian-part Chebyshev approximated VCC (HC$^d$-VCC), where $d$ indicates the maximum degree of the Chebyshev polynomials. The latter method decomposes the cluster operator into anti-Hermitian and Hermitian parts, with the anti-Hermitian part represented by the disentangled unitary coupled cluster ansatz and the Hermitian part approximated using Chebyshev expansion. We illustrate the implementation of the HC$^d$-VCC in a quantum circuit using the quantum singular value transformation technique. Numerical simulations show that the C$^d$-VCC rapidly converges to the exact VCC with increasing truncation degree $d$, and the HC$^d$-VCC effectively reduces the Chebyshev expansion error compared to the C$^d$-VCC. The HC$^d$-VCC method for realizing non-unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum computers is expected to be useful for initial state preparation on quantum computers and efficient tomography of the quantum state for post-processing on classical computers after quantum computations.

    "abstract": "           High resolution maps of polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are in high demand, since the discovery of primordial B-Modes in the polarization patterns would confirm the inflationary phase of the Universe that would have taken place before the last scattering of the CMB at the recombination epoch. Transition Edge Sensors (TES) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) are the predominant detector technologies of cryogenic detector array based CMB instruments that search for primordial B-Modes. In this paper we propose another type of cryogenic detector to be used for CMB survey: A magnetic microbolometer (MMB) that is based on a paramagnetic temperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study of neutrino mass. The effort to adapt MMCs for CMB surveys is triggered by their lack of Johnson noise associated with the detector readout, the possibility of straightforward calibration and higher dynamic range given it possesses a broad and smooth responsivity dependence with temperature and the absence of Joule dissipation which simplifies the thermal design. A brief proof of concept case study is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurements and reliable microfabrication processes. The results show that MMBs provide a promising technology for CMB polarization survey as their sensitivity can be tuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneously maintaining a low time response to avoid distortion of the point-source response of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabrication techniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a change of detector technology would even come with very low cost.         ",

    "abstract": "           The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.         ",

The in-fiber MZI, formed using a segment of TCF optic, detects refractive index (RI) changes in the surrounding medium. The sensor utilizes the evanescent wave of one core as the sensing arm, necessitating a thin cladding achieved through one-sided chemical etching. This design allows the sensor to detect subtle alterations in the RI of the environment by observing displacements in the interference spectrum. The optogenetic stimulation of light-sensitive cells induces variations in ion concentrations, leading to a corresponding change in refractive index. The fabricated sensor, with a peak sensitivity of 675.74 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.39-1.43, can detect these changes. A computer simulation validated the sensitivity and optimized fabrication parameters, exhibiting satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Spectrum displacements were recorded for both light-sensitive hDPSCs and regular hDPSCs (as a control test). Results from the experiment, analyzed and compared using data analysis software, revealed that 473 nm blue light effectively stimulated light-sensitive hDPSCs. Notably, the proposed sensor, a novel structure, demonstrated its capability to detect RI changes in the cell medium during optogenetic applications.         ",

Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\u00e9 materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.

This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.         ",

    "title": "Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field",
    "abstract": "           We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N spectral sidebands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can estimate the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two sidebands spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.
