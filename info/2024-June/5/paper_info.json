    "abstract": "           Power-law distribution is one of the most important laws known in nature. Such a special universal behavior is known to occur in very few physical systems. In this work, we analyzed the mortality distribution of the Covid-19 pandemic tails for different countries and continents to discuss the possible universal behavior of the pandemic. Surprisingly, we found that the mortality distribution of Covid-19 follows inverse power-law decays. These universal behaviors for the pandemic are reported in the present work for the first time. Additionally, we showed that mortality tails also decay with time obeying to the inverse power law.         ",

    "title": "Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data",
    "abstract": "           The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.

We show that non-redundant masks are required due to phase fluctuations arising within the experimental set-up. We also show, using closure phase, that the phase fluctuations are factorizable into element-based errors. We employ multiple masks, including 2, 3, 5, and 6 hole configurations. We develop a process for self-calibration of the element-based amplitudes (square root of flux through the aperture), which corrects for non-uniform illumination over the mask, in order to derive visibility coherences and phases, from which the source size and shape can be derived. We explore the optimal procedures to obtain the most reliable results with the 5-hole mask, based on the temporal scatter in measured coherences and closure phases. We find that the closure phases are very stable, and close to zero (within $2^o$). Through uv-modeling, we consider the noise properties of the experiment and conclude that our visibility measurements per frame are likely accurate to an rms scatter of $\\sim 1\\%$.         ",

Further, we propose a general design method for ultra-long OPL MMCs with multi-cycle mode by adding cyclic elements. The OPL of the MMCs designed by this method can reach the order of kilometers or even tens of kilometers. The novel MMCs have the advantages of simple structure, strong spot formation regularity, easy expansion, high mirror utilization ratio, high reuse times of spot spatial position, good stability and extremely high ratio of the optical path length to the volume (RLV). In order to evaluate the performance of the new MMCs, an open-path methane gas sensor with the MMC based on triple PBWC was constructed, which was used to continuously measure the methane in the laboratory, and the feasibility, effectiveness and practicability of the new design method were verified. The design method proposed in this paper provides a new idea for the design of multipass cell (MPC), and the new MMCs designed have great potential application value in the field of high-precision trace gas monitoring.

    "abstract": "           Silicon microring resonators (MRRs) have shown strong potential in acting as the nonlinear nodes of photonic reservoir computing (RC) schemes. By using nonlinearities within a silicon MRR, such as the ones caused by free-carrier dispersion (FCD) and thermo-optic (TO) effects, it is possible to map the input data of the RC to a higher dimensional space. Furthermore, by adding an external waveguide between the through and add ports of the MRR, it is possible to implement a time-delay RC (TDRC) with enhanced memory. The input from the through port is fed back into the add port of the ring with the delay applied by the external waveguide effectively adding memory. In a TDRC, the nodes are multiplexed in time, and their respective time evolutions are detected at the drop port. The performance of MRR-based TDRC is highly dependent on the amount of nonlinearity in the MRR. The nonlinear effects, in turn, are dependent on the physical properties of the MRR as they determine the lifetime of the effects. Another factor to take into account is the stability of the MRR response, as strong time-domain discontinuities at the drop port are known to emerge from FCD nonlinearities due to self-pulsing (high nonlinear behaviour). However, quantifying the right amount of nonlinearity that RC needs for a certain task in order to achieve optimum performance is challenging. Therefore, further analysis is required to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics of this TDRC setup. Here, we quantify the nonlinear and linear memory capacity of the previously described microring-based TDRC scheme, as a function of the time constants of the generated carriers and the thermal of the TO effects. We analyze the properties of the TDRC dynamics that generate the parameter space, in terms of input signal power and frequency detuning range, over which conventional RC tasks can be satisfactorily performed by the TDRC scheme.

Some of these advantages, however, are questioned for the ambiguous role of the control system in the quantum switch that is an experimentally realized process with indefinite causal structure. In communications, for example, not only the superposition of alternative causal orders, but also the superposition of alternative trajectories can accelerate information transmissions. Here, we follow the proposal of Liu et al. [Phys. Rev.

Although its action on the system qubit only is thermally free, our results suggest that the quantum switch should be seen as a resource when the control qubit is also considered. Moreover, we characterize the non-Markovian property in this scenario by measuring the information backflows from the heat baths to the system qubit.         ",

This paper introduces, validates and evaluates the unique multi-resonant phenomena predicted by circuit theory for over-coupled inductive arrays, and presents eigen-formulae for calculating resonant frequencies and voltage modes within passively excited arrays. Finite-element simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the multi-modal resonant principles for strongly-coupled inductor arrays. The results confirm the distinctive multi-modal resonant frequencies these arrays exhibit, corresponding to the specific magnetic excitation \"modes\" (comparable to vibrational modes in multi-degree-of-freedom systems). The theoretical and finite element models presented offer a framework for designing and optimizing novel inductive sensing arrays, capitalizing on the unique resonant effects of over-coupling and exploiting their potential magnetic field shaping.

The use of normalizing flows enables efficient uncorrelated sampling of configurations from the probability distribution defined by the wavefunction, mitigating a major cost of using neural states in simulation. We demonstrate the use of this architecture for both ground-state preparation (for self-interacting particles in a harmonic trap) and real-time evolution (for one-dimensional tunneling). Finally, we detail a procedure for obtaining rigorous estimates of the systematic error when using neural states to approximate quantum evolution.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum simulation offers an analog approach for exploring exotic quantum phenomena using controllable platforms, typically necessitating ultracold temperatures to maintain the quantum coherence. Superradiance lattices (SLs) have been harnessed to simulate coherent topological physics at room temperature, but the thermal motion of atoms remains a notable challenge in accurately measuring the physical quantities. To overcome this obstacle, we invent and validate a velocity scanning tomography technique to discern the responses of atoms with different velocities, allowing cold-atom spectroscopic resolution within room-temperature SLs. By comparing absorption spectra with and without atoms moving at specific velocities, we can derive the Wannier-Stark ladders of the SL across various effective static electric fields, their strengths being proportional to the atomic velocities. We extract the Zak phase of the SL by monitoring the ladder frequency shift as a function of the atomic velocity, effectively demonstrating the topological winding of the energy bands. Our research signifies the feasibility of room-temperature quantum simulation and facilitates their applications in quantum information processing.         ",

Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.         ",

    "abstract": "           The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.         ",

In this work, we present a quantum-informed local analogue model (QILAM) that maps these nonclassical optical responses onto a local dielectric film. The primary advantage of this model lies in its compatibility with the highly efficient boundary element method (BEM), which includes retardation effects and eliminates the need to incorporate wavevector-dependent permittivity. Furthermore, our approach offers a unified framework that connects two important semiclassical theories: the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory and the Feibelman d-parameters formalism. We envision that QILAM could evolve into a multiscale electrodynamic tool for exploring nonclassical optical responses in diverse plasmonic structures in future. This could be achieved by directly translating mesoscopic effects into observable phenomena, such as resonance energy shifts and linewidth broadening in the scattering spectrum.         ",

The investigation of the long-term evolution of the rotating quantum droplets confirms the stability of the quantum states. At certain rotation speeds, the multi-periodic trajectories and breathings provide evidence of the emergence of the collective excitation of the surface mode in the vortex state. For quantum droplets carrying multiply quantized vortex, the microscopic snapshots of the rotation field adjusted current density distribution show that the combined nonlinear interaction and the anharmonic trapping potential can provide the restoring force to lead the quantum droplet to a regular and stable revolution and reach the dynamic equilibrium, revealing the signature of the generation of superfluids in the new kind of low-dimensional quantum liquids.

    "abstract": "           We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.

Despite their significance, the formal connection between the memory kernel and the influence functions has not been explicitly made. We reveal their relation by inspecting the system propagator for a broad class of problems where an $N$-level system is linearly coupled to Gaussian baths (bosonic, fermionic, and spin.) With this connection, we also show how approximate path integral methods can be understood in terms of approximate memory kernels. For a certain class of open quantum system problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct ${\\mathcal{K}}$ from $\\mathbf{I}$ for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths without the use of any projection-free dynamics inputs required by standard approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from a set of reduced system trajectories obtained experimentally or by numerically exact methods, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide in this work will significantly advance the understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, and they will be an important stepping stone for theoretical and experimental developments in this area.
