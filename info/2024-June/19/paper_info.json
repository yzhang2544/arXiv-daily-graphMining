    "abstract": "           Gamification of quantum theory can provide new inroads into the subject: by allowing users to experience simulated worlds that manifest obvious quantum behaviors they can potentially build intuition for quantum phenomena. The Qubit Factory is an engineering-style puzzle game based on a gamified quantum circuit simulator that is designed to provide an introduction to qubits and quantum computing, while being approachable to those with no prior background in the area. It introduces an intuitive visual language for representing quantum states, gates and circuits, further enhanced by animations to aid in visualization. The Qubit Factory presents a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tasks for the user to solve, where each task requires the user to construct and run an appropriate classical/quantum circuit built from a small selection of components. Earlier tasks cover the fundamentals of qubits, quantum gates, superpositions and entanglement. Later tasks cover important quantum algorithms and protocols including superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement distillation, classical and quantum error correction, state tomography, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, quantum repeaters and more.

    "abstract": "           Fast and sensitive detector arrays enable image scanning microscopy (ISM), overcoming the trade-off between spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) typical of confocal microscopy. However, current ISM approaches cannot provide optical sectioning and fail with thick samples, unless the size of the detector is limited. Thus, another trade-off between optical sectioning and SNR persists. Here, we propose a method without drawbacks that combines uncompromised super-resolution, high SNR, and optical sectioning. Furthermore, our approach enables super-sampling of images, relaxing Nyquist's criterion by a factor of two. Based on the observation that imaging with a detector array inherently embeds axial information about the sample, we designed a straightforward reconstruction algorithm that inverts the physical model of ISM. We present the comprehensive theoretical framework and validate our method with synthetic and experimental images of biological samples captured using a custom setup equipped with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach exciting fluorescence emission both in the linear and non-linear regime. Moreover, we generalize the algorithm for fluorescence lifetime imaging, fully exploiting the single-photon timing ability of the SPAD array detector. Our method outperforms conventional approaches to ISM and can be extended to any LSM technique.         ",

This is markedly different from the known case of Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals that react within seconds with PbBr2 and get transformed into much larger, green emitting CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Here, instead, the conversion of (KxCs1-x)4PbBr6 nanocrystals to CsPbBr3 QDs occurs in a time span of hours, and tuning of the QDs size is achieved by adjusting the concentration of precursors. The QDs exhibit excitonic features in optical absorption that are tunable in the 420 - 452 nm range, accompanied by blue photoluminescence with quantum yield around 60%. Detailed spectroscopic investigations in both the single and multi-exciton regime reveal the exciton fine structure and the effect of Auger recombination of these CsPbBr3 QDs, confirming theoretical predictions for this system.

    "abstract": "           Temporal cavity solitons (CSs) are stable, localized particle-like objects in the form of optical pulses that circulate indefinitely in coherently driven nonlinear resonators. In the spectral domain, they form highly coherent frequency combs. Owing to their remarkable stability, they are attracting attention for applications in sensing, metrology, or optical signal synthesis. In this work, we report on the dynamics of CSs interacting with a trapping potential. We demonstrate that this interaction provides a powerful means to control their properties such as position, speed, and central frequency. Our theoretical analysis predicts fundamental limitations on the spectral shift of CSs relative to the driving frequency. Specifically, it reveals that within a broad range of detunings, frequency-shifted CSs encounter destabilization through a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, we find that with periodic potentials, the Kelly sidebands emitted by trapped solitons undergo Bloch oscillations. In our experiments, we use an intracavity phase modulator to create the equivalent of an external real potential. We observe stable blue- and red- shifted solitons up to a limit close to our theoretical predictions. We then show theoretically and experimentally that this unprecedented level of control over the CS spectrum can be leveraged to cancel the Raman-induced self-frequency shift and even to stabilize CSs beyond the limitation imposed by stimulated Raman scattering. Our results provide valuable insights for applications requiring robust and potentially rapid tunable control over the cavity soliton properties.         ",

The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.         ",

    "abstract": "           Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used frequently in spintronic applications, mostly to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to move magnetic domain walls (DW). Because the SAW cannot achieve magnetic switching without the assistance of a magnetic field or a current, for a marginal improvement in the energy required for the magnetic switching, the device gains in complexity, making it impractical. In this work, we report a mechanism that allows a transfer of linear momentum from the acoustic wave to the magnetic domain wall. Experimentally we show that, using the appropriate dimensions of the magnetic strip, the SAW can move the DW in the same direction as the traveling SAW. With the help of micromagnetic simulations, we reveal a complex yet direct mechanism that allows the SAW to push the DW in the same direction of its travel, even without any external field or currents. The DW can reach velocities in the range of 100 m/s and at a very small energetic cost, equivalent to using a current density of $\\sim 5 \\cdot 10^4 A/cm^2$ if the movement was triggered by spin transfer. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.         ",

The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.

Recently, the photonic community has renewed its attention towards these materials, recognizing their remarkable nonlinear optical properties in the near-infrared spectrum, a feature previously overlooked despite their long-standing application in photovoltaics and touchscreens. The exceptionally large and ultra-fast change of the refractive index, which can be optically induced in these compounds, extends beyond the boundaries of conventional perturbative analysis and makes this class of materials the closest approximation to a time-varying system, and a unique playground for studying a variety of novel phenomena within the domain of photon acceleration. Here we report the spatio-spectral fission of an ultra-fast pulse trespassing a thin film of aluminium zinc oxide with a non-stationary refractive index. By applying phase conservation to this time-varying layer, our model can account for both space and time refraction and explain in quantitative terms, the spatial separation of both the spectrum and energy.

Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz.
