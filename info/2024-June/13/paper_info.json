    "abstract": "           We discuss how classical electromagnetic techniques are useful to describe optical effects in conventional and chiral dielectric systems endowed with optical activity. Starting from the Maxwell equations and constitutive relations of the medium, we obtain the wave equation (for the electric field) that yields the refractive indices and the corresponding propagating modes that define the electromagnetic wave polarization. This procedure is employed for bi-isotropic and bi-anisotropic dielectrics, allowing us to determine birefringence, a manifestation of the space or time inversion breaking, typical of the chiral media. Such a method can also be applied for axion electrodynamics and a dielectric supporting an isotropic chiral magnetic current, similar to the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). For a diagonal magnetic conductivity, two distinct refractive indices are found, associated with left circularly polarized (LCP) and right circularly polarized (RCP) waves, and yielding circular birefringence (evaluated in terms of the optical rotatory power). Additionally, the scenario of a bi-isotropic medium endowed with isotropic magnetic current is examined, where a rotatory power marked by sign reversal may work as an optical signature of this particular system.

A thin layer (~10 um) of D-glucose was placed in close proximity to the CPS and the transmission response was measured using a modified THz-TDS setup. The D-glucose introduces frequency-dependent changes to the effective permittivity of the CPS resulting in a modified spectral response at the receiver. Measurement results show absorption signatures at 1.42 THz and 2.07 THz corresponding to the first two significant resonances beyond 1 THz for D-glucose allowing for label-free detection. The frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient was estimated by simulation for several D-glucose layer thicknesses using a modified Lorentz model. Measurement results align with simulations and other literature that use free-space THz radiation. This work verifies on-chip THz sensing of D-glucose and presents a pathway towards on-chip sensing of other materials at THz frequencies.         ",

    "abstract": "           The resolvent analysis reveals the worst-case disturbances and the most amplified response in a fluid flow that can develop around a stationary base state. The recent work by Padovan et al.(2020) extended the classical resolvent analysis to the harmonic resolvent analysis framework by incorporating the time-varying nature of the base flow. The harmonic resolvent analysis can capture the triadic interactions between perturbations at two different frequencies through a base flow at a particular frequency. The singular values of the harmonic resolvent operator act as a gain between the spatio-temporal forcing and the response provided by the singular vectors. In the current study, we formulate the harmonic resolvent analysis framework for compressible flows based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equation (i.e., operator-based formulation). We validate our approach by applying the technique to the low-mach number flow past an airfoil. We further illustrate the application of this method to compressible cavity flows at Mach numbers of 0.6 and 0.8 with a length-to-depth ratio of $2$. For the cavity flow at Mach number of 0.6, the harmonic resolvent analysis reveals that the nonlinear cross-frequency interactions dominate the amplification of perturbations at frequencies that are harmonics of the leading Rossiter mode in the nonlinear flow. The findings demonstrate a physically consistent representation of an energy transfer from slow-evolving modes toward fast-evolving modes in the flow through cross-frequency interactions. For the cavity flow at Mach number of 0.8, the analysis also sheds light on the nature of cross-frequency interaction in a cavity flow with two coexisting resonances.         ",

Validating the predictions with our 1D Schr\u00f6dinger solver, the predicted values show 5% to 15% error for structures where a laser transition could occur, and 35% to 70% error for structures where there was no laser transition. The algorithm allowed (i) for the identification of high figure of merit structures, (ii) recognition of which layers should be altered to maximize the figure of merit at a given electric field, and (iii) increased the original design figure of merit of 94.7 to 141.2 eV ps \u00c5^2, a 1.5-fold improvement and significant for QC lasers.

    "abstract": "           Silicon carbide (SiC) is a semiconductor used in quantum information processing, microelectromechanical systems, photonics, power electronics, and harsh environment sensors. However, its high temperature stability, high breakdown voltage, wide bandgap, and high mechanical strength are accompanied by a chemical inertness which makes complex micromachining difficult. Photoelectrochemical etching is a simple, rapid means of wet processing SiC, including the use of dopant selective etch stops that take advantage of mature SiC homoepitaxy. However, dopant selective photoelectrochemical etching typically relies on highly doped material, which poses challenges for device applications such as quantum defects and photonics that benefit from low doping to produce robust emitter properties and high optical transparency. In this work, we develop a new, selective photoelectrochemical etching process that relies not on high doping but on the electrical depletion of a fabricated diode structure, allowing the selective etching of an n-doped substrate wafer versus an undoped epitaxial ($N_a=1(10)^{14}cm^{-3}$) device layer. We characterize the photo-response and photoelectrochemical etching behavior of the diode under bias and use those insights to suspend large ($>100\\mu m^2$) undoped membranes of SiC. We further characterize the compatibility of membranes with quantum emitters, performing comparative spin spectroscopy between undoped and highly doped membrane structures, finding the use of undoped material improves ensemble spin lifetime by $>3x$. This work enables the fabrication of high-purity suspended thin films suitable for scalable photonics, mechanics, and quantum technologies in SiC.         ",

The paper outlines the spatial and time grids used in TRANSP and details the equilibrium assumptions and solvers. Various models for heating and current drive, including updates to the NUBEAM model, are discussed. The handling of large-scale events such as sawtooth crashes and pellet injections is examined, along with the predictive capabilities for advancing plasma profiles.

Additionally, the paper discusses best practices and continuous integration techniques to enhance TRANSP's robustness.

Continuous development and support ensure that TRANSP remains a major code for the analysis of experimental data for controlled thermonuclear fusion, maintaining its critical role in supporting the optimization of tokamak operations and advancing fusion research.

Operating such a cavity below 1~K should reduce the thermal noise limit of the cavity, and by this way address the current limitations of ultrastable lasers. To further decrease mechanical losses, mirrors with silicon substrates and crystalline coatings are optically contacted to the spacer, resulting in a room-temperature finesse of 220,000. To operate our cavity at sub-kelvin temperatures, we use a dilution refrigerator able to reach temperatures down to 10 mK.

This preprint presents an implementation and application of graphics processing unit-accelerated ph-AFQMC, for multi-Slater determinant trial wavefunctions (GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC), to enable efficient simulation of large-scale, strongly correlated systems. This approach allows for nearly-exact computation of ground state energies in multi-reference systems. Our GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC is implemented in the open-source code \\texttt{ipie}, a Python-based AFQMC package [\\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}, 2022, 19(1): 109-121].

In view of these applications, we use quantum embedding to derive a many-body description of strain and charge induced Stark effects on the NV$^{-}$ center. We quantify how strain longitudinal to the axis of NV$^{-}$ shifts the excited states in energy, while strain with a component transverse to the NV axis splits the degeneracies of the $^{3}E$ and $^{1}E$ states. The largest effects are for the optically relevant $^{3}E$ manifold, which splits into $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ with transverse strain. From these responses we extract strain susceptibilities for the $E_{x/y}$ states within the quasi-linear regime. Additionally, we study the many-body dipole matrix elements of the NV$^{-}$ and find a permanent dipole 1.64 D at zero strain, which is $\\sim 30 \\%$ smaller than that obtained from recent density functional theory calculations. We also determine the transition dipole between the $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ and how it evolves with strain.         ",

    "abstract": "           Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detected axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.

    "abstract": "           Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $<1.25^\\circ$.

Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.         ",

These modems transmit data through fiber optic cables that are thousands of kilometers in length at data rates exceeding one terabit per second. This remarkable technology is made possible through near-THz-rate programmable control and sensing of the full optical wavefield. While coherent optical modems form the backbone of telecommunications networks around the world, their extraordinary capabilities also provide unique opportunities for imaging. Here, we introduce full-wavefield lidar: a new imaging modality that repurposes off-the-shelf coherent optical modems to simultaneously measure distance, axial velocity, and polarization. We demonstrate this modality by combining a 74 GHz-bandwidth coherent optical modem with free-space coupling optics and scanning mirrors. We develop a time-resolved image formation model for this system and formulate a maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm to recover depth, velocity, and polarization information at each scene point from the modem's raw transmitted and received symbols. Compared to existing lidars, full-wavefield lidar promises improved mm-scale ranging accuracy from brief, microsecond exposure times, reliable velocimetry, and robustness to intererence from ambient light or other lidar signals.

    "title": "High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED",
    "abstract": "           We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.         ",
