    "title": "An insertable glucose sensor using a compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager and machine learning",
    "abstract": "           Optical continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are emerging for personalized glucose management owing to their lower cost and prolonged durability compared to conventional electrochemical CGMs. Here, we report a computational CGM system, which integrates a biocompatible phosphorescence-based insertable biosensor and a custom-designed phosphorescence lifetime imager (PLI). This compact and cost-effective PLI is designed to capture phosphorescence lifetime images of an insertable sensor through the skin, where the lifetime of the emitted phosphorescence signal is modulated by the local concentration of glucose. Because this phosphorescence signal has a very long lifetime compared to tissue autofluorescence or excitation leakage processes, it completely bypasses these noise sources by measuring the sensor emission over several tens of microseconds after the excitation light is turned off. The lifetime images acquired through the skin are processed by neural network-based models for misalignment-tolerant inference of glucose levels, accurately revealing normal, low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) concentration ranges. Using a 1-mm thick skin phantom mimicking the optical properties of human skin, we performed in vitro testing of the PLI using glucose-spiked samples, yielding 88.8% inference accuracy, also showing resilience to random and unknown misalignments within a lateral distance of ~4.7 mm with respect to the position of the insertable sensor underneath the skin phantom. Furthermore, the PLI accurately identified larger lateral misalignments beyond 5 mm, prompting user intervention for re-alignment. The misalignment-resilient glucose concentration inference capability of this compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager makes it an appealing wearable diagnostics tool for real-time tracking of glucose and other biomarkers.

After critically addressing this atomist dogma still present today in contemporary (quantum) physics and philosophy, we present a new understanding of quantum individuals defined as the minimum set of relations within a specific degree of complexity capable to account for all relations within that same degree. In this case, quantum individuality is not conceived in absolute terms but -- instead -- as an objectively relative concept which even though depends of the choice of bases and factorizations remain nonetheless part of the same invariant representation.

The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.         ",

It is critically important to understand how a harmonically mode-locked pulse train responds to external perturbations and noise, so as to make sure that it is stable and resistant to noise. Here, in a series of carefully designed experiments, we elucidate the retiming dynamics of laser pulses generated in a soliton fiber laser harmonically mode-locked at ~2 GHz to the acoustic resonance in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) core. We characterize the self-driven optomechanical lattice along the PCF using a homodyne set-up, and reveal that each soliton undergoes damped oscillatory retiming within its trapping potential after an abrupt perturbation. In addition we show, through statistical analysis of the intra-cavity pulse spacing, how the trapping potentials are effective for suppressing timing jitter. The experimental results are well described using a dynamic model including dissipation, which provides valuable insight into the stability and noise performance of optomechanically mode-locked laser systems, and may also be useful for studying complex inter-soliton interactions.

The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, we present a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits. This technique immediately provides a means to scale QPUs with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.

We contemplate several resonant scenarios whose efficiency to enhance anomalous scattering processes is compared to that of non-resonant setups. The presence of quantum signatures in analogue configurations, such as the violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities or entanglement, is analyzed, observing that resonant configurations highly increase the entanglement signal, especially for the Andreev effect. We also discuss how these results have served as inspiration for the rapidly expanding field of quantum information in high-energy colliders. Finally, we study the physics of black-hole lasers as further examples of resonant analogue structures, distinguishing three stages in its time evolution. For short times, we compute the linear and non-linear spectrum for different models. For intermediate times, we generalize the current analysis of the BHL-BCL crossover.

Experimental examination at this length scale is challenging, however, since the corresponding electromagnetic near-field is often confined within volumes below the resolution of conventional optical microscopy. In semiconductor nanophotonics electromagnetic fields are further restricted within the confines of individual subwavelength resonators, limiting access to critical light-matter interactions in these structures. In this work, we demonstrate that photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) can be used for polarization resolved near-field spectroscopy and imaging of electromagnetic resonances supported by broken-symmetry silicon metasurfaces. We find that the photoemission results, enabled through an in-situ potassium surface layer, are consistent with full-wave simulations and far-field reflectance measurements across visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In addition, we uncover a polarization dependent evolution of collective resonances near the metasurface array edge taking advantage of the far-field excitation and full-field imaging of PEEM. Here, we deduce that coupling between eight resonators or more establishes the collective excitations of this metasurface. All told, we demonstrate that the high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging and far-field illumination of PEEM can be leveraged for the metrology of collective, non-local, optical resonances in semiconductor nanophotonic structures.

The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes.

This work addresses the gap by introducing a novel approach that couples a decay spawning dynamics algorithm with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to characterize ultrafast dynamics on the potential energy surfaces. We apply our method to a model decay cascade following K-shell ionization of IBr and subsequent K\\b{eta} fluorescence decay. We examine two competing channels that undergo two decay steps, resulting in ion pairs with a total +3 charge state. This approach provides a continuous description of the electron transfer dynamics occurring during the multi-step decay cascade and molecular fragmentation, revealing the combined inner-shell decay and charge transfer timescale to be approximately 75 fs.

The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans' theorem is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy surface of a finite system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat plane-structure of the oxygen atom, among others. We find that derivative discontinuities with respect to electron count sometimes occur at non-integer values.
