    "title": "Can Specific THz Fields Induce Collective Base-Flipping in DNA? A Stochastic Averaging and Resonant Enhancement Investigation Based on a New Mesoscopic Model",
    "abstract": "           We study the metastability, internal frequencies, activation mechanism, energy transfer, and the collective base-flipping in a mesoscopic DNA via resonance with specific electric fields. Our new mesoscopic DNA model takes into account not only the issues of helicity and the coupling of an electric field with the base dipole moments, but also includes environmental effects such as fluid viscosity and thermal noise. And all the parameter values are chosen to best represent the typical values for the opening and closing dynamics of a DNA. Our study shows that while the mesocopic DNA is metastable and robust to environmental effects, it is vulnerable to certain frequencies that could be targeted by specific THz fields for triggering its collective base-flipping dynamics and causing large amplitude separation of base pairs. Based on applying Freidlin-Wentzell method of stochastic averaging and the newly developed theory of resonant enhancement to our mesoscopic DNA model, our semi-analytic estimates show that the required fields should be THz fields with frequencies around 0.28 THz and with amplitudes in the order of 450 kV/cm. These estimates compare well with the experimental data of Titova et al., which have demonstrated that they could affect the function of DNA in human skin tissues by THz pulses with frequencies around 0.5 THz and with a peak electric field at 220 kV/cm. Moreover, our estimates also conform to a number of other experimental results which appeared in the last couple years.         ",

    "title": "DEDALO: Device for Enhanced Dust Analyses with Light Obscuration sensors",
    "abstract": "           Instruments based on light obscuration sensors are widely used for measuring the size distribution of insoluble sub-visible particles in liquid suspensions, being fast and suitable for in situ and real-time measurements. Such instruments are typically calibrated by means of reference polystyrene spherical particles with a specific refractive index, which unavoidably leads to systematic errors when determining the size of particles of different materials. In this paper, we propose a reliable and consistent method to overcome this limitation by setting the refractive index value according to the sample, thus achieving an improved particle size distribution (PSD) measurement. An ad hoc, ready-to-use, open source code with a graphical interface able to drive an in-line instrument and obtain a real-time correction to the PSD has been developed. The method has been extensively validated with several oil emulsions characterized by different refractive index values and the results have been compared with an independent optical method. As an example of application, we have adopted this approach for the analysis of dust suspended in meltwater of an ice core from a glacier in the Aosta Valley (Italy). We believe that our approach will strongly improve the accuracy in characterizing liquid suspensions and reduce discrepancies between data obtained with different methods.

    "abstract": "           Heat flux meters are used for measuring the heat flux densities going through walls, usually at quasi-steady state. The limitations of heat flux meters under dynamic conditions are well documented in the literature; nonetheless there is a theoretical limitation which is mostly not considered and should be also taken into account. Since heat transfer is a dissipative process, it would be expected to obtain transfer functions which act as low pass filters. Nonetheless, this paper shows that the transfer functions modeling heat flow rate may become high pass filters, which is against the physical evidence. In order to show this theoretical limitation of the heat flux meters, the heat equation is transformed in different classes of models, from partial differential equations to transfer functions related to surface temperatures and heat flux density going through a wall.

    "abstract": "           Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) filters find applications in radio frequency (RF) communication systems for Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. In the beyond-5G (potential 6G) era, high frequency bands (>8 GHz) are expected to require resonators with high-quality factor (Q) and electromechanical coupling (k_t^2) to form filters with low insertion loss and high selectivity. However, both the Q and k_t^2 of resonator devices formed in traditional uniform polarization piezoelectric films of aluminum nitride (AlN) and aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) decrease when scaled beyond 8 GHz. In this work, we utilized 4-layer AlScN periodically poled piezoelectric films (P3F) to construct high frequency (~17-18 GHz) resonators and filters. The resonator performance is studied over a range of device geometries, with the best resonator achieving a k_t^2 of 11.8% and a Q_p of 236.6 at the parallel resonance frequency (fp) of 17.9 GHz. These resulting figures of merit are ((FoM)_1=(k_t^2 Q)_p and (FoM_2=f_p(FoM)_1x10^-9) ) 27.9 and 500 respectively. These and the k_t^2 are significantly higher than previously reported An/AlScN-based resonators operating at similar frequencies. Fabricated 3-element and 6-element filters formed from these resonators demonstrated low insertion losses (IL) of 1.86 dB and 3.25 dB, and -3 dB bandwidths (BW) of 680 MHz (fractional BW of 3.9%) and 590 MHz (fractional BW of 3.3%) at ~17.4 GHz center frequency. The 3-element and 6-element filters achieved excellent linearity with in-band input third-order intercept point (IIP3) values of +36 dBm and +40 dBm, respectively, which are significantly higher than previously reported acoustic filters operating at similar frequencies.

    "abstract": "           Nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) is a form of diamond electrode with near-infrared photoresponsivity, making it well suited for physiological applications. N-UNCD's photoresponsivity is strongly influenced by its surface. While it is known that oxygen treatment provides a higher photoresponsivity, a better understanding of its surface processes is needed to tailor the material for optical neuromodulation. This work examines the impact of various oxygen treatment methods, with aim of creating oxygen rich surfaces with different chemical and structural properties. Surface characterisation methods along with electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements and modelling were used to investigate the films. It was found that oxygen furnace annealing resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in the near-infrared photoresponsivity, to 3.75 +/- 0.05 uA/W. This translates to an approximate 200 times increase in the photocurrent compared to the untreated surface. This enhancement in photocurrent is largely due to the changes in the chemical species present at the surface. The photocurrent is estimated to be sufficient for extra-cellular stimulation of brain neurons within the safe optical exposure limit, positioning N-UNCD as an excellent candidate to be used in next-generation photoelectrodes for photobiomodulation.

    "abstract": "           Modern communication and sensing technologies rely on connecting the optical domain with the microwave domain. Terahertz technologies, spanning increased frequencies from 100 GHz to 10 THz, are critical for providing larger bandwidths and faster switching capabilities. Despite progress in high-frequency electronic sources and detectors, these technologies lack a direct link to the optical domain, and face challenges with increasing frequencies (> 1 THz). Nonlinear processes, such as optical rectification, offer potential solutions for terahertz generation but are currently limited to discrete components based on bulk nonlinear crystals, missing out miniaturisation opportunities from integration of optical circuits with terahertz ones. We address this challenge by integrating phase-matched terahertz transmission lines with photonic circuits in a single hybrid architecture on the thin-film lithium niobate~(TFLN) platform. This design demonstrates phase-matched, broadband terahertz emission spanning four octaves (200 GHz to 3.5 THz) through broadband down-conversion of optical signals at telecommunication wavelengths. The micron-sized transmission lines provide terahertz field confinement with minimal radiative loss, enabling compact THz cavities embedded in integrated photonic circuits. This integration is crucial for leveraging photonics' advantages in low-noise, low-loss, and high-speed operations for terahertz generation. Our platform can readily be integrated with other mature photonics components, such as electro-optic modulators, frequency comb sources, or femtosecond sources to pave the way for compact, power-efficient, and frequency-agile broadband sources with applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, quantum electrodynamics and optical computing.

In particular, they play a key role in neuromorphic chips, acting as optical neurons. A list of requirements exist for thresholders to be practically applicable in this context. A value of the threshold, in general, should be independently tunable for each neuron. A sharpness of the corresponding step function should be also dynamically variable, to allow switching between deterministic and stochastic algorithms, for example, in optical Ising machines. Nonlinear ring resonators draw the attention of researchers in this field since they potentially can provide the required type of threshold behavior. Here we suggest the switching mechanism that implements the property of resonators to provide extremely sharp (with respect to the wavelength) $\\pi$ phase shifts near the critical coupling regime. Adding a variable source of losses into the resonator, a well controlled broadening of the threshold can be achieved. Sharpness of the step in this case is independent on the quality factor of resonators and corresponding width of resonances. The nonlinear switching mechanism allows to use this feature to construct efficient optical neurons, that operate at small intensities. It also allows to use conventional materials like silicon with a relatively weak Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results potentially lead the way to fast nonlinear Kerr effect based activation functions that can operate in continuous wave regime.         ",

    "abstract": "           Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as a vital tool for tumour resection procedures. As well as intraoperative tumour visualisation, 5-ALA-induced PpIX provides an avenue for quantitative tumour identification based on ratiometric fluorescence measurement. To this end, fluorescence imaging and fibre-based probes have enabled more precise demarcation between the cancerous and healthy tissues. These sensing approaches, which rely on collecting the fluorescence light from the tumour resection site and its remote spectral sensing, introduce challenges associated with optical losses. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of tumour detection at the resection site using a miniature fluorescence measurement system. Unlike the current bulky systems, which necessitate remote measurement, we have adopted a millimetre-sized spectral sensor chip for quantitative fluorescence measurements. A reliable measurement at the resection site requires a stable optical window between the tissue and the optoelectronic system. This is achieved using an antifouling diamond window, which provides stable optical transparency. The system achieved a sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 98.3% in detecting a surrogate tumour at a resolution of 1 x 1 mm2. As well as addressing losses associated with collecting and coupling fluorescence light in the current remote sensing approaches, the small size of the system introduced in this work paves the way for its direct integration with the tumour resection tools with the aim of more accurate interoperative tumour identification.

Here, we report the first proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a photonic quantum engine driven by superradiance employing a single heat reservoir composed of atoms and photonic vacuum. Reservoir atoms prepared in a quantum coherent superposition state underwent superradiance while traversing the cavity. This led to about 40-fold increase of the effective engine temperature, resulting in a near-unity engine efficiency. Moreover, the observed engine output power grew quadratically with respect to the atomic injection rate. Our work can be utilized in quantum mechanical heat transfer as well as in boosting engine powers, opening a pathway to development of photomechanical devices that run on quantum coherence embedded in heat baths.

Current research on these devices is dedicated to create next generation energy-efficient hardware for communication technologies. However, the underlying physics governing the formation of auto-oscillation modes, their output power and line width in a single SHNO device have remained elusive so far. We image the sources of magnetic auto-oscillations in a metallic SHNO using a single spin quantum sensor. We directly measure the microwave field generated by an auto-oscillation spot at the nanoscale by driving the electron spin resonance transition of the sensor spin, enabling faster acquisition speed (100 ms/pixel). Instead of being defined by the points of the largest antidamping only, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time with quantitative magnetometry that the auto-oscillation spots are determined by the positions of the magnetic field minima. The latter act as local potential wells for confining spin-waves, thus supporting large amplitude auto-oscillations. By comparing the magnitude of the magnetic stray field at these spots, we decipher the different frequencies of the auto-oscillation modes. The insights gained regarding the interaction between auto-oscillation modes and spin-wave potential wells enable advanced engineering of real devices.         ",

Non-Hermicity is engineered by using a traveling field directly interacting with YIG. The external magnetic field excites collective mechanical modes of magnons, which later excites cavity mode leading to a coupling between cavity magnons and photons. The magnomechanical interaction of the system also excites phonon and couple them to the system. By computing eigenvalue spectrum, we demonstrate the occurrence of three-order exceptional point emerge with the increase of magnon-photon coupling at a specific incidence angle of traveling field. We illustrate the unique bi-broken and uni-protected PT-symmetry regions in eigenvalue spectrum unlike previously investigated non-Hermitian system, which can be tuned with gain and loss configuration by manipulating ratio between traveling field strength and magnon-photon coupling. Interestingly, protected PT-symmetry only exists on the axis of exceptional point. We further show that the PT-symmetry can only be govern at two angle of incident of traveling field. However, later, by performing stability analysis, we illustrate that the system is only stable at $\\pi/2$ and, on all other angles, either the system is non-PT-symmetric or it is unstable. Furthermore, we govern the parametric stability conditions for the system and, by defining stablity parameter, illustrate the stable and unstable parametric regimes. Our finding not only discusses a new type of PT-symmetric system, but also could act as foundation to bring cavity magnomechanics to the subject of quantum information and process.         ",

In this paper, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of three QFCs using a single on-chip $Si_3N_4$ WGMR across distinct modal families. We designed a micro-ring resonator with a radius of 240 $\\mu m$, capable of supporting four modal families within the 130 to 260 $THz$ frequency range for consistency regulation. Our results indicate that, by carefully designing the structure of $Si_3 N_4$ WGMRs, it is possible to generate quantum entangled frequency combs across distinct modal families simultaneously using monochromatic pump light. This is achieved by modulating the pump mode profiles with a spatial light modulator (SLM). Our approach offers a simple and low-cost method to achieve higher-density entanglement integration on-chip.         ",

However, first-principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, we introduce GNNOpt, an equivariance graph-neural-network architecture featuring automatic embedding optimization. This enables high-quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers-Kr{\u00f6}nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. We apply the trained model to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First-principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs which hosts exotic quasiparticles, demonstrates GNNOpt's potential in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and applications.

There are the quantisation (discrete set of values) of the observables (e.g., energy, momentum, angular momentum); forbidden simultaneous measurements of the observables in the most cases (e.g., of a coordinate and momentum, of angular momentum projections on difference axis); counter-intuitive relations on the simultaneously measurable quantities (e.g., the famous expression for the square momentum $l(l+1)$ with the maximal projection $l$). These and other paradoxes are traditionally related to \"purely quantum\" phenomenon, i.e., having no analogue in the \"classical world\" ones. However, there are deep analogies between classical and \"quantum\" worlds, as soon as the quantum technique is applied to the classical phenomenon. We follow these analogies with the examples of relatively simple and well known models of classical physics, such as a simplified model of light transition through the media, a system of electric charges close to each other and far from the observer; the specific of motion in the Coulomb/Newtonian field.

This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing platforms are subject to contradictory engineering requirements: qubits must be protected from mutual interactions when idling ('doing nothing'), and strongly interacting when in operation. If idling qubits are not sufficiently protected, information can 'leak' into neighbouring qubits, become non-locally distributed, and ultimately inaccessible. Candidate solutions to this dilemma include patterning-enhanced many-body localization, dynamical decoupling, and active error correction. However, no information-theoretic protocol exists to actually quantify this information loss due to internal dynamics in a similar way to e.g. SPAM errors or dephasing times. In this work, we develop a scalable, flexible, device non-specific protocol for quantifying this bitwise idle information loss based on the exploitation of tools from quantum information theory. We implement this protocol in over 3500 experiments carried out across 4 months (Dec 2023 - Mar 2024) on IBM's entire Falcon 5.11 series of processors. After accounting for other sources of error, and extrapolating results via a scaling analysis in shot count to zero shot noise, we detect idle information leakage to a high degree of statistical significance. This work thus provides a firm quantitative foundation from which the protection-operation dilemma can be investigated and ultimately resolved.         ",

Adapting an explainable AI method in LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), certain high-frequency waveform signatures of AE are to be attributed to two major pathways for pore formation in a DED process, namely, spatter events and insufficient fusion between adjacent printing tracks from low heat input. This approach opens an exciting possibility to predict, in real-time, the presence of a pore in every voxel (0.5 mm in size) as they are printed, a major leap forward compared to prior efforts. Synchronized multimodal sensor data including force, AE, vibration and temperature were gathered while an SS316L material sample was printed and subsequently machined. A deep convolution neural network classifier was used to identify the presence of pores on a voxel surface based on time-frequency patterns (spectrograms) of the sensor data collected during the process chain. The results suggest signals collected during DED were more sensitive compared to those from machining for detecting porosity in voxels (classification test accuracy of 87%). The underlying explanations drawn from LIME analysis suggests that energy captured in high frequency AE waveforms are 33% lower for porous voxels indicating a relatively lower laser-material interaction in the melt pool, and hence insufficient fusion and poor overlap between adjacent printing tracks. The porous voxels for which spatter events were prevalent during printing had about 27% higher energy contents in the high frequency AE band compared to other porous voxels. These signatures from AE signal can further the understanding of pore formation from spatter and insufficient fusion.         ",

Quantum rates are calculated using the numerically exact multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, as well as the approximate ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), ring-polymer instanton (RPI) methods, and classical mechanics. By conducting simulations across a wide range of temperatures and friction strengths, we can identify the various regimes that govern the reactive dynamics. At high temperatures, in addition to the spatial-diffusion and energy-diffusion regimes predicted by Kramer's rate theory, a (coherent) tunnelling-dominated regime is identified at low friction. At low temperatures, incoherent tunnelling dominates most of Kramer's curve, except at very low friction when coherent tunnelling becomes dominant. Unlike in classical mechanics, the bath's influence changes the equilibrium time-independent properties of the system, leading to a complex interplay between spatially dependent friction and nuclear quantum effects even at high temperatures. More specifically, a realistic friction profile can lead to an increase (decrease) of the quantum (classical) rates with friction within the spatial-diffusion regime, showing that classical and quantum rates display qualitatively different behaviours. Except at very low frictions, we find that RPMD captures most of the quantum effects in the thermal reaction rates.         ",

The second method is insensitive to vibrations and enables observation of moving objects. The simplicity and low cost of this instrument make it valuable for a variety of applications.         ",

Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.         ",

    "abstract": "           Today's mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers aim to minimize this trauma, with minimally invasive surgery using laser cutting as one innovation. This method ablates tissue using laser light instead of mechanical tools, reducing post-surgery healing time. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. We propose a tissue classification method analyzing acoustic waves generated during laser ablation, demonstrating its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, acquired with an air-coupled transducer. These waves were used to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or principal components of the frequency spectrum as input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as input. Consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve classification accuracy. Grad-Cam identified the activation map of the frequencies, showing low frequencies as the most important for this task. Our results indicated that combining time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum achieved the highest classification accuracy (65.5%-75.5%). We also found that using the frequency spectrum alone was sufficient, with no additional benefit from applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).         ",

However, the spectral range of this technique has been limited by the tuning range of infrared sources, which is generally restricted to the fingerprint window with commercially available quantum cascade lasers. In this work, ultra-broadband synchrotron infrared radiation was used for infrared photothermal imaging and spectroscopy, spanning the entire mid-infrared range. Both optical- and fluorescence-detected photothermal modalities were performed, demonstrating improved spectral range when compared to optical photothermal microscopy using commercial sources and improved spatial resolution when compared to synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements. Following these initial validation studies, synchrotron Fourier-transform optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (FT-OPTIR) in combination with synchrotron micro-spectroscopy measurements were used to differentiate cells in mouse brain tissue sections.

    "abstract": "           Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts due to their inherent quantum behavior. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is up-scaling the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace filtering through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) followed by spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to $10^{-4}$. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.

This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of measurement strategies for quantities isomorphic to location parameters, which are shown to admit a closed-form optimisation. The resulting framework admits any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. As an example, the metrology of relative weights is formulated from first principles and shown to require hyperbolic errors. The primary advantage of this approach lies in its simplifying power: it reduces the search for good strategies to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant. This will facilitate the application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role.         ",

Our approach is based on the use of a dimensionless thermodynamic potential expressed as a function of the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables. Using the principles of dimensionless minimum work and dimensionless maximum entropy derived from quasi-static changes of external perturbations and temperature, we obtain the Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energy. These potentials can be interconverted through time-dependent Legendre transformations. Our results are verified numerically for an anharmonic Brownian system described in phase space using the low-temperature quantum Fokker-Planck equations in the quantum case and the Kramers equation in the classical case, both developed for the thermodynamic system-bath model. Thus, we clarify the conditions for thermodynamics to be valid even for small systems described by Hamiltonians and establish a basis for extending thermodynamics to non-equilibrium conditions.

    "abstract": "           Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $<1.25^\\circ$.

Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.         ",
