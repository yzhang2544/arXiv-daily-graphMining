    "abstract": "Electropolishing (EP) of 1.3 GHz niobium superconducting RF cavities is conducted to achieve a desired smooth and contaminant-free surface that yields good RF performance. Achieving a smooth surface of a large-sized elliptical cavity with the standard EP conditions was found to be challenging. This work aimed to conduct a systematic parametric EP study to understand the effects of various EP parameters on the surface of 650 MHz niobium cavities used in the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) linear accelerator. Parameters optimized in this study provided a smooth surface of the cavities. The electropolished cavity showed significantly a higher accelerating gradient meeting baseline requirement and qualified for further surface treatment to improve the cavity quality factor. ",

Finally, we design and fabricate nanoperforated photonic membranes in silicon nitride (SiN) and image directly their multifractal modes using leaky-mode spectroscopy in the visible spectral range. The measured data demonstrate optical resonances with multiscale intensity fluctuations in good qualitative agreement with numerical simulations.

    "abstract": "On-chip generation of optical frequency combs using nonlinear ring resonators has opened the route to numerous novel applications of combs that were otherwise limited to mode-locked laser systems. Nevertheless, even after more than a decade of development, on-chip nonlinear combs still predominantly rely on the use of single-ring resonators. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that generating combs in a topological array of resonators can provide a new avenue to engineer comb spectra. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of such a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice of hundreds of nonlinear ring resonators. Specifically, the lattice hosts topological edge states that exhibit fabrication-robust linear dispersion and spatial confinement at the boundary of the lattice. Upon optical pumping of the topological edge band, these unique properties of the edge states lead to the generation of a frequency comb that is also spectrally confined within the edge band across $\\approx$40 longitudinal modes. Moreover, using spatial imaging of our topological lattice, we confirm that light generated in the comb teeth is indeed spatially confined at the lattice edge, characteristic of linear topological systems. Our results bring together the fields of topological photonics and optical frequency combs, providing an opportunity to explore the interplay between topology and nonlinear systems in a platform compatible with commercially available nanofabrication processes.

Based on symmetric considerations, we transform higher-dimensional models into a single 1D model with a dimension parameter. This transformation not only yields a substantial reduction in computational complexity, but also enables an efficient examination of how dimensionality impacts the system dynamics. In the absence of nonlinearity, we analyze the eigenstates of the linear systems. This allows us to uncover a heightened concentration of the eigenmodes at the center of the potential well, while witnessing a consistent equal spacing among their eigenvalues, as the dimension parameter increases. In the presence of nonlinearity, our findings distinctly reveal that the stability of the localized states diminishes with increasing dimensionality. This study offers an approach to tackling high-dimensional problems, shedding light on the fundamental dimensional connections among radially symmetric states across different dimensions, and providing valuable tools for analysis.

However, limited by highly crowded boundary resonators and complicated site couplings, the hyperbolic topological insulator has only been experimentally constructed in electric circuits. How to achieve hyperbolic photonic topological insulators is still an open question. Here, we report the experimental realization of hyperbolic photonic topological insulators using coupled ring resonators on silicon chips. Boundary-dominated one-way edge states with pseudospindependent propagation directions have been observed. Furthermore, the robustness of edge states in hyperbolic photonic topological insulators is also verified.

Such a configuration can be realized experimentally using a specially designed capillary setup.

On the anode side, we allow for elastic deformations to reflect the large volumetric changes of Si. With physics-based continuum modeling we can provide insight into usually hardly accessible quantities like the stress distribution in the active material. For the IL electrolyte, our thermodynamically consistent transport theory includes convection as relevant transport mechanism. We present our volume-averaged 1d+1d framework and perform parameter studies to investigate the influence of the Si anode morphology on the cell performance. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating the volumetric expansion of Si in physics-based simulations.

However, the reliance on off-chip bulk lasers compromises the compact nature of these systems. While silicon photonics and III-V platforms have established integrated laser technologies, emerging demands for ultra-low optical loss, wider bandgaps, and optical nonlinearities necessitate other platforms. Developing integrated lasers on less mature platforms is arduous and costly due to limited throughput or unconventional process requirements. In response, we propose a novel platform-agnostic laser integration technique utilizing a singular design and process flow, applicable without modification to a diverse range of platforms. Leveraging a two-step micro-transfer printing method, we achieve nearly identical laser performance across platforms with refractive indices between 1.7 and 2.5. Experimental validation demonstrates strikingly similar laser characteristics between devices processed on lithium niobate and silicon nitride platforms. Furthermore, we showcase the integration of a laser with a resonant electro-optic comb generator on the thin-film lithium niobate platform, producing over 80 comb lines spanning 12 nm. This versatile technique transcends platform-specific limitations, facilitating applications like microwave photonics, handheld spectrometers, and cost-effective Lidar systems, across multiple platforms.

    "abstract": "Although the scientific principles of anthropogenic climate change are well-established, existing calculations of the warming effect of carbon dioxide rely on spectral absorption databases, which obscures the physical foundations of the climate problem. Here we show how CO2 radiative forcing can be expressed via a first-principles description of the molecule's key vibrational-rotational transitions. Our analysis elucidates the dependence of carbon dioxide's effectiveness as a greenhouse gas on the Fermi resonance between the symmetric stretch mode $\\nu_1$ and bending mode $\\nu_2$. It is remarkable that an apparently accidental quantum resonance in an otherwise ordinary three-atom molecule has had such a large impact on our planet's climate over geologic time, and will also help determine its future warming due to human activity. In addition to providing a simple explanation of CO2 radiative forcing on Earth, our results may have implications for understanding radiation and climate on other planets. ",

We demonstrate that for a sufficiently strong quasiperiodic modulation, the microcavity features a sharp mobility edge separating a cluster of localized states from the rest of the spectrum consisting of states extended over the whole ring. Localized modes can be excited using a resonant pump whose topological charge determines the phase distribution of excited patterns. Repulsive polariton interactions make the resonance peaks distinctively asymmetric and enable the formation of multistable states which feature the attractor-like dynamical behavior \\rev{and hysteresis}. We also demonstrate that the localized states can be realized in a biannular cavity that consists of two rings, each having periodic modulation, such that the periods of two modulations are different.

A hybrid quantum-classical procedure is used to locate the seam of CIs.

Although various schemes have been proposed and demonstrated to realize such photonic matrix accelerators, the in-situ training of artificial neural networks using photonic accelerators remains challenging due to the difficulty of direct on-chip backpropagation on a photonic chip. In this work, we propose a silicon microring resonator (MRR) optical crossbar array with a symmetric structure that allows for simple on-chip backpropagation, potentially enabling the acceleration of both the inference and training phases of deep learning. We demonstrate a 4 $\\times$ 4 circuit on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and use it to perform inference tasks of a simple neural network for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, we train the neural network using simulated on-chip backpropagation and achieve an accuracy of 91.1% in the same inference task after training. This work contributes to the realization of compact and energy-efficient photonic accelerators for deep learning. ",

    "abstract": "Fractal lattices are self-similar structures with repeated patterns on different scales. As in other aperiodic lattices, the absence of translational symmetry can give rise to quantum localization effects. In contrast to low-dimensional disordered systems, co-existence of localized and extended states is possible in fractal structures, and can lead to subtle transport behavior. Here, we study the dynamical properties of two fractal lattices, the Sierpi\\'nski gasket and the Sierpi\\'nski carpet. Despite their geometric similarity, the transport turns out to behave very differently: In the Sierpi\\'nski gasket, we find a sub-diffusive behavior, whereas the Sierpi\\'nski carpet exhibits sub-ballistic transport properties. We show that the different dynamical behavior is in line with qualitative differences of the systems' spectral properties. Specifically, in contrast to the Sierpi\\'nski carpet, the Sierpi\\'nski gasket exhibits an inverse power-law behavior of the level spacing distribution. From the point of view of technological applications, we demonstrate that the sub-diffusive behavior in the Sierpi\\'nski gasket can be used as a quantum memory. By interpolating between fractal and regular lattices, a flexible tuning between different transport regimes becomes possible. ",

In this work, we demonstrate a new paradigm for assembly of atomic arrays, based on a synergistic combination of optical tweezers and cavity-enhanced optical lattices, and the incremental filling of a target array from a repetitively filled reservoir. In this protocol, the tweezers provide microscopic rearrangement of atoms, while the cavity-enhanced lattices enable the creation of large numbers of deep optical potentials that allow for rapid low-loss imaging of atoms. We apply this protocol to demonstrate deterministic filling (99% per-site occupancy) of 1225-site arrays. Because the reservoir is repeatedly filled with fresh atoms, the array can be maintained in a filled state indefinitely. We anticipate that this protocol will be compatible with mid-circuit reloading, which will be a key capability for running large-scale error-corrected quantum computations whose durations exceed the lifetime of a single atom in the system.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is an emerging technology with potentially far-reaching implications for national prosperity and security. Understanding the timeframes over which economic benefits and national security risks may manifest themselves is vital for ensuring the prudent development of this technology. To inform security experts and policy decision makers on this matter, we review what is currently known on the potential uses and risks of quantum computers, leveraging current research literature. The maturity of currently-available quantum computers is not yet at a level such that they can be used in production for large-scale, industrially-relevant problems, but they are not believed to currently pose security risks. We identify 2 large-scale trends -- new approximate methods (variational algorithms, error mitigation, and circuit knitting) and the commercial exploration of business-relevant quantum applications -- which, together, may enable useful and practical quantum computing in the near future. Crucially, these methods do not appear likely to change the required resources for cryptanalysis on currently-used cryptosystems. From an analysis we perform of the current and known algorithms for cryptanalysis, we find they require circuits of a size exceeding those that can be run by current and near-future quantum computers (and which will require error correction), though we acknowledge improvements in quantum algorithms for these problems are taking place in the literature. In addition, the risk to cybersecurity can be well-managed by the migration to new, quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, which we survey and discuss. Given the above, we conclude there is a credible expectation that quantum computers will be capable of performing computations which are economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are cryptographically-relevant.

    "abstract": "Analytical results are presented for a model system consisting of an ensemble of N molecules under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). The single bare molecular model is composed of one effective electron, which couples harmonically to multiple nuclei. A priori no harmonic approximation is imposed for the inter-nuclear interactions. Within the cavity Born-Oppenheimer partitioning, i.e., when assuming classical nuclei and displacement field coordinates, the dressed N-electron problem can be solved analytically in the dilute limit. In more detail, we present a self-consistent solution of the corresponding cavity-Hartree equations, which illustrates the relevance of the non-perturbative treatment of electronic screening effects under VSC. We exemplify our derivations for an ensemble of harmonic model CO2 molecules, which shows that common simplifications can introduce non-physical effects (e.g., a spurious coupling of the transverse field to the center-of-mass motion for neutral atoms). In addition, our self-consistent solution reveals a simple analytic expression for the cavity-induced red shift and the associated refractive index, which can be interpreted as a polarizability-dependent detuning of the cavity. Finally, we highlight that anharmonic intra-molecular interactions might become essential for the formation of local strong coupling effects within a molecular ensemble under collective VSC. ",
