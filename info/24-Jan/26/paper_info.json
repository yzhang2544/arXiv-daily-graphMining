    "abstract": "Inverse problems in granular flows, such as landslides and debris flows, involve estimating material parameters or boundary conditions based on target runout profile. Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization. ",

    "abstract": "In Quantum Electrodynamics, vacuum becomes a nonlinear optical medium: its optical index should be modified in the presence of intense external electromagnetic fields. The DeLLight project (Deflection of Light by Light) aims to observe this effect using intense focused femtosecond laser pulses delivered by LASERIX. The principle is to measure with a Sagnac interferometer the deflection of a low-intensity focused pulse (probe) crossing the vacuum index gradient induced by a high-intensity pulse (pump). A Sagnac interferometer working with femtosecond laser pulses has been developed for the DeLLight project. Compared to previous prototypes, the interferometer now includes the focusing of the probe beam in the interaction area. In this article, we measure and characterize the critical experimental parameters limiting the sensitivity of the interferometer, namely the extinction factor, the spatial resolution, and the waist at focus of the probe pulse. We discuss future improvements. ",

Silicon (Si) photonics offers a powerful solution for this issue by providing a platform for high-bandwidth, energy-efficient interconnects. Furthermore, memristors have emerged as a fundamental building block for non-volatile data storage and novel computing architectures with powerful in-memory processing capabilities. In this paper, we integrate an Al2O3 memristor into a heterogeneous Si quantum dot microring laser to demonstrate the first laser with non-volatile optical memory. The memristor alters the effective optical modal index of the microring laser cavity by the plasma dispersion effect in the high resistance state (HRS) or Joule heating in the low resistance state (LRS), subsequently controlling the output wavelength of the laser in a non-volatile manner. This device enables a novel pathway for future optoelectronic neuromorphic computers and optical memory chips. ",

What is less well understood is how the system reciprocity manifests in the bidirectionally transferred powers with a beamformed system such as a massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) array. To answer this question, we connect four disparate ideas, Lorentz reciprocity, the Friis transmission formula, noise-based active antenna parameters, and the active antenna available power. This results in an unnamed power gain that is connected with available gain and transducer gain but is unmentioned in the theory of two-port amplifiers. This quantity is symmetric under link direction reversal in the near field, as well as the far field, and generalizes the Friis transmission formula to beamformed multiport antenna systems in an arbitrary reciprocal propagation environment.

These 3D wavepackets exhibit phase singularities and cylinder-shaped edge dislocations, resulting in a multi-ring topology in its spatiotemporal profile. Unlike conventional ST optical vortices, STLG wavepackets with non-zero p and l values carry a composite transverse OAM consisting of two directionally opposite components. We further demonstrate mode conversion between an STLG wavepacket and an ST Hermite-Gaussian wavepacket through the application of strong spatiotemporal astigmatism. The converted STHG wavepacket is de-coupled in intensity in space-time domain that can be utilized to implement the efficient and accurate recognition of ultrafast STLG wavepackets carried various p and l. This study may offer new insights into high-dimensional quantum information, photonic topology, and nonlinear optics, while promising potential applications in other wave phenomena such as acoustics and electron waves.

This leads to a combination of the Newton equation and the overdamped Langevin equation for the centroid and non-centroid variables, respectively. BCMD shares the basic properties of other PI approaches such as centroid and ring polymer molecular dynamics: It gives the correct Kubo-transformed correlation function at short times, conserves the time symmetry, has the correct high-temperature/classical limits, gives exactly the position and velocity autocorrelations of harmonic oscillator systems, and does not have the zero-point leakage problem. Numerical tests were done on simple molecular models and liquid water. On-the-fly ab initio BCMD simulations were performed for the protonated water cluster, H$_5$O$_2^+$, and its isotopologue, D$_5^{}$O$_2^+$. ",

The method does not require the strong magnetic fields or careful shielding of the working cell. The method allows the laser frequency to be stabilized in the vicinity of the low-frequency transition in the D1 line of Cs. Though the absorption line in a gas-filled cell is characterized by a width of the order of gigahertz, parametric stability and resolution at the level of tens of kilohertz can be achieved. ",

The process is unfolded through the adiabatic theorem, which allows us to delineate the transition between a solely frequency-converted wave packet and a temporally-driven mode conversion. In other words, our paper explores the role of time modulation in the context of elastic metasurfaces, and we envision our implementation to be suitable for designing a new family of SAW devices with frequency conversion, mode conversion, and unusual transport capabilities.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) demands large data flows within datacenters, heavily relying on multicasting data transfers. As AI models scale, the requirement for high-bandwidth and low-latency networking compounds. The common use of electrical packet switching faces limitations due to its optical-electrical-optical conversion bottleneck. Optical switches, while bandwidth-agnostic and low-latency, suffer from having only unicast or non-scalable multicasting capability. This paper introduces an optical switching technique addressing the scalable multicasting challenge. Our approach enables arbitrarily programmable simultaneous unicast and multicast connectivity, eliminating the need for optical splitters that hinder scalability due to optical power loss. We use phase modulation in multiple planes, tailored to implement any multicast connectivity map. Using phase modulation enables wavelength selectivity on top of spatial selectivity, resulting in an optical switch that implements space-wavelength routing. We conducted simulations and experiments to validate our approach. Our results affirm the concept's feasibility and effectiveness, as a multicasting switch. ",

Instead, the system is put in contact with two different baths, and only a nonequilibrium state exists, sustained by constant energy injection from the surrounding thermal baths. Firstly, we show that the nonequilibrium conditions can dramatically enlarge the parameter regimes where the MPE emerges. Secondly, we demonstrate that the anomalous MPEs and inverse MPEs emerge in the evolution of quantum correlations in the two-site fermionic system and that nonequilibrium conditions can expedite or delay the MPEs.
