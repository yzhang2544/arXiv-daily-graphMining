    "abstract": "In the present work, first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) are performed to study the electronic and optical properties of penta-graphene (PG) monolayer. The results indicated that PG is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of approximately 2.32 eV at the DFT- GGA level. We found that the utilization of the GW approximation based on many-body perturbation theory led to an increase in the band gap, resulting in a quasi-direct gap of 5.35 eV. Additionally, we employed the G0W0 - RP A and G0W0 - BSE approximations to calculate the optical spectra in the absence and in the presence of electron-hole interaction, respectively. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of electron-hole interaction caused a red-shift of the absorption spectrum towards lower energies compared to the spectrum obtained from the G0W0 - RP A approximation. With the electron-hole interaction, it is found that the optical absorption spectra are dominated by the first bound exciton with a significant binding energy 3.07 eV. The study concluded that the PG monolayer, with a wider band gap and enhanced excitonic effects, holds promise as a suitable candidate for the design and fabrication of optoelectronic components. ",

    "abstract": "We report the development of a novel variant of cavity ring-down polarimetry using a continuous-wave laser operating at 532 nm for highly precise chiroptical activity and magnetometry measurements. The key methodology of the apparatus relies upon the external modulation of the laser frequency at the frequency splitting between non-degenerate left- and right-circularly polarised cavity modes. The method is demonstrated by evaluation of the Verdet constants of crystalline CeF3 and fused silica, in addition to the observation of gas- and solution-phase optical rotations of selected chiral molecules. Specifically, optical rotations of (i) vapours of alpha-pinene and R-(+)-limonene, (ii) mutarotating D-glucose in water, and (iii) acidified L-histidine solutions, are determined. The detection sensitivities for the gas- and solution phase chiral activity measurements are ~30 microdeg and ~120 microdeg over a 30 s detection period per cavity roundtrip pass, respectively. Furthermore, the measured optical rotations for R-(+)-limonene are compared with computations performed using the Turbomole quantum chemistry package. The experimentally observed optically rotatory dispersion of this cyclic monoterpene was thus rationalised via consideration of its room temperature conformer distribution as determined by the aforementioned single-point energy calculations.

    "title": "Estimating the time-evolving refractivity of a turbulent medium using  optical beam measurements: a data assimilation approach",
    "abstract": "In applications such as free-space optical communication, a signal is often recovered after propagation through a turbulent medium. In this setting, it is common to assume that limited information is known about the turbulent medium, such as a space- and time-averaged statistic (e.g., root-mean-square), but without information about the state of the spatial variations. It could be helpful to gain more information if the state of the turbulent medium can be characterized with the spatial variations and evolution in time described. Here, we propose to investigate the use of data assimilation techniques for this purpose. A computational setting is used with the paraxial wave equation, and the extended Kalman filter is used to conduct data assimilation using intensity measurements. To reduce computational cost, the evolution of the turbulent medium is modeled as a stochastic process. Following some past studies, the process has only a small number of Fourier wavelengths for spatial variations. The results show that the spatial and temporal variations of the medium are recovered accurately in many cases. In some time windows in some cases, the error is larger for the recovery. Finally we discuss the potential use of the spatial variation information for aiding the recovery of the transmitted signal or beam source. ",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) detector has great potential for use in imaging, spectroscopy, and communications due to its fascinating interactions between radiation and matter. However, current THz detection devices have limitations in sensitivity, operating frequency range, and bulky footprint. While recent ferroelectric-integrated graphene plasmonic devices show promise in overcoming these limitations, they are not yet extended to the THz range. Here, we propose a wavelength-sensitive terahertz detector that uses a single layer graphene integrated onto the ferroelectric thin film with patterned polarization domains. This device works at room temperature, with high responsivity and detectivity by coupling graphene plasmons with THz frequencies through spatial modulation of carrier behaviors using ferroelectric polarization, without requiring additional local electrodes. By reconfiguring an interweaving squared ferroelectric domain array with alternating upward and downward polarizations to highly confine graphene surface plasmon polaritons, our device achieves an ultrahigh responsivity of 1717 A W-1 and a normalized detectivity of 1.07*10^13 Jones at a resonance frequency of 6.30 THz and a 0.3 V bias voltage. We also show that the device makes possible for spectrum reconstruction application of portable spectrometer combining the mathematical algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "A major difficulty in quantum simulation is the adequate treatment of a large collection of entangled particles, synonymous with electron correlation in electronic structure theory, with coupled cluster (CC) theory being the leading framework in dealing with this problem. Augmenting computationally affordable low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified by the \"gold standard\" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored. In this work, we propose a similar approach wherein converged UCCSD amplitudes, which can be obtained on a quantum computer, are leveraged by a classical computer to evaluate energy corrections associated with triple excitations - leading to the UCCSD[T] and UCCSD(T*) methods. The rationale behind these choices is shown to be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals. Although our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order contribution as in the (T) correction, comparisons are nevertheless made using a hybrid UCCSD(T) approach. We assess the performance of these approaches on a collection of small molecules, and demonstrate the benefits of harnessing the inherent synergy between MBPT and UCC theories. ",

    "abstract": "We develop a field-nonlinear theory of sub-Doppler spectroscopy in a gas of two-level atoms, based on a self-consistent solution of the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the mean field and single-atom density matrix approximations. This makes it possible to correctly take into account the effects caused by the free motion of atoms in a gas, which lead to a nonlinear dependence of the spectroscopic signal on the atomic density even in the absent of a direct interatomic interaction (e.g., dipole-dipole interaction). Within the framework of this approach, analytical expressions for the light field were obtained for an arbitrary number of resonant waves and arbitrary optical thickness of a gas medium. Sub-Doppler spectroscopy in the transmission signal for two counterpropagating and co-propagating waves has been studied in detail. A previously unknown red shift of a narrow sub-Doppler resonance is predicted in a counterpropagating waves scheme, when the frequency of one wave is fixed and the frequency of the other wave is varied. The magnitude of this shift depends on the atomic density and can be more than an order of magnitude greater than the known shift from the interatomic dipole-dipole interaction (Lorentz-Lorenz shift). The found effects, caused by the free motion of atoms, require a significant revision of the existing picture of spectroscopic effects depending on the density of atoms in a gas. Apart of fundamental aspect, obtained results are important for precision laser spectroscopy and optical atomic clocks. ",

Two situations are considered: i) bosons loaded into an optical lattice and ii) in a trapped two-component dilute Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), in the regime where the Bogoliubov approximation is often employed. Atom and photon degrees of freedom are treated on equal footing within an exact time-dependent configuration interaction scheme, and cavity leakage is included by including classical oscillator baths. For optical lattices, we consider few bosons in short chains, described via the Bose-Hubbard model with two levels per site, and we find that the spectral response grows on increasing the number of atoms at weak interactions, but diminishes at high interactions (if the number of chain sites does not exceed the number of atoms), and is shifted to lower frequency. In the BEC regime, the spectra display at noticeable extent a scaling behavior with the number of particles and a suitable rescaling of the BEC-cavity and inter-particle interactions, whilst the SHG spectrum redshifts at large atom-atom correlations. Overall, our results provide some general trends for the fluorescence from ultracold bosons in optical cavities, which can be of reference to experimental studies and further theoretical work. ",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that the spontaneous emission rate of photons by free electrons, unlike stimulated emission, is independent of the shape or modulation of the quantum electron wavefunction (QEW). Nevertheless, here we show that the quantum state of the emitted photons is non-classical and does depend on the QEW shape. This non-classicality originates from the shape dependent off-diagonal terms of the photon density matrix. This is manifested in the Wigner distribution function and would be observable experimentally through Homodyne detection techniques as a squeezing effect. Considering a scheme of electrons interaction with a single microcavity mode, we present a QED formulation of spontaneous emission by multiple modulated QEWs through a build-up process. Our findings indicate that in the case of a density modulated QEWs beam, the phase of the off-diagonal terms of the photon state emitted by the modulated QEWs is the harbinger of bunched beam superradiance, where the spontaneous emission is proportional to N_e^2. This observation offers a potential for enhancement of other quantum electron interactions with quantum systems by a modulated QEWs beam carrying coherence and quantum properties of the modulation.
