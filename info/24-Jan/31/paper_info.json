    "abstract": "Wavefront errors are a common artifact in laser light generation and imaging. They can be described as an aberration from the spherical wavefront of an ideal Gaussian beam by combinations of higher-order Hermite- or Laguerre-Gaussian terms. Here, we present an algorithm called Beamfit to estimate the mode composition from a series of CCD images taken over the Rayleigh range of a laser beam. The algorithm uses a user-defined set of Hermite- or Laguerre-Gaussian modes as the basis of its theoretical model. A novel method reduces the number of calculations needed to compute the model's intensity profiles. For a given model containing $N$ modes, the number of Hermite-Gaussian complex amplitudes needed to calculate are reduced from orders of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and replaced by simple multiplications. Additionally, non-beam parameters are pre-calculated to further reduce the search space dimension and its resulting calculation time. It is planned to release the Beamfit software to the public under an open-source license. ",

    "abstract": "Extracting consistent statistics between relevant free-energy minima of a molecular system is essential for physics, chemistry and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can aid in this task but are computationally expensive, especially for systems that require quantum accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we develop an approach combining enhanced sampling with deep generative models and active learning of a machine learning potential (MLP). We introduce an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that enables the training of one Normalizing Flow (NF) and one MLP per state. We simulate several Markov chains in parallel until they reach convergence, sampling the Boltzmann distribution with an efficient use of energy evaluations. At each iteration, we compute the energy of a subset of the NF-generated configurations using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we predict the remaining configuration's energy with the MLP and actively train the MLP using the DFT-computed energies. Leveraging the trained NF and MLP models, we can compute thermodynamic observables such as free-energy differences or optical spectra. We apply this method to study the isomerization of an ultrasmall silver nanocluster, belonging to a set of systems with diverse applications in the fields of medicine and catalysis. ",

The ever-growing scale of these applications drives innovation in multi-wavelength lasers for massively parallel processing. We report a nanophotonic Kerr-resonator circuit that consumes the power of an input laser and generates a soliton frequency comb at approaching unit efficiency. By coupling forward and backward propagation, we realize a bidirectional Kerr resonator that supports universal phase matching but also opens excess loss by double-sided emission. Therefore, we induce reflection of the resonator's forward, external-coupling port to favor backward propagation, resulting in efficient, one-sided soliton formation. Coherent backscattering with nanophotonics provides the control to put arbitrary phase-matching and efficient laser-power consumption on equal footing in Kerr resonators. In the overcoupled-resonator regime, we measure 65% conversion efficiency of a 40 mW input pump laser, and the nonlinear circuit consumes 97% of the pump, generating the maximum possible comb power. Our work opens up high-efficiency soliton formation in integrated photonics, exploring how energy flows in nonlinear circuits and enabling laser sources for advanced transmission, computing, quantum sensing, and artificial-intelligence applications.

The state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse emitters in the mid-infrared are complex, bulky, and inefficient systems based on the downconversion of near-infrared or visible pulsed laser sources. Here we show a purely DC-driven semiconductor laser chip that generates one picosecond solitons at the center wavelength of 8.3 {\\mu}m at GHz repetition rates. The soliton generation scheme is akin to that of passive nonlinear Kerr resonators. It relies on a fast bistability in active nonlinear laser resonators, unlike traditional passive mode-locking which relies on saturable absorbers or active mode-locking by gain modulation in semiconductor lasers. Monolithic integration of all components - drive laser, active ring resonator, coupler, and pump filter - enables turnkey generation of bright solitons that remain robust for hours of continuous operation without active stabilization. Such devices can be readily produced at industrial laser foundries using standard fabrication protocols. Our work unifies the physics of active and passive microresonator frequency combs, while simultaneously establishing a technology for nonlinear integrated photonics in the mid-infrared. ",

We apply the formalism to a case of elastic scattering and derive a generalized optical theorem for ultrashort wave-packet scattering. By numerical simulations with 1-fs wave packets, we find in angular distributions of electrons on a detector one-fold and anomalous two-fold azimuthal asymmetries. We discuss how the asymmetries relate to the coherence properties of the electron beam, and to the magnitude and phase of the scattering amplitude. The essential role of the phase of the exact scattering amplitude is revealed by comparison with results obtained using the first-Born approximation. Our work paves a way for controlling electron-matter interaction by the lateral and transversal coherence properties of pulsed electron beams. ",

Using a simple two-dimensional model we show that the Doppler effect and relativistic aberration of the propelling laser beam create damping terms in the optical forces and torques. The effect is similar to the Poynting-Robertson effect causing loss of orbital momentum of dust particles around stars, but can be enhanced by design of the sail's geometry. ",

The spectra computed using this approach show an improved intensity ratio compared to CCSD-in-HF.

The formation of buffer Si layer in a single growth process has been found to significantly improve the crystalline quality of the GaAs layers formed on its surface, as well as to prevent the formation of anti-phase domains both on offcutted towards the [110] direction and on singular Si(100) substrates. It has been demonstrated that the use of cyclic thermal annealing at temperatures 350-660{\\deg}C in the flow of arsenic atoms makes it possible to reduce the number of threading dislocations and increase the smoothness of the GaAs layers surface. At the same time, the article considers possible mechanisms that lead to an improvement in the quality of the surface layers of GaAs. It is shown that the thus obtained GaAs layers of submicron thickness on the singular Si(100) substrates have a mean square value of surface roughness 1.9 nm. The principal possibility of using thin GaAs layers on silicon as templates for forming on them light-emitting semiconductor heterostructures with active area based on self-organizing InAs quantum dots and InGaAs quantum well is presented.

Deposition pressure and radio frequency power are varied for optimization of the properties of the thin films and the ScOx-Si interface. The physical characterization was performed by ellipsometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Aluminum gate electrodes were evaporated for metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) fabrication. From the electrical characterization of the MIS devices, the density of interfacial defects is found to decrease with deposition pressure, showing a reduced plasma damage of the substrate surface for higher pressures. This is also supported by lower flatband voltage shifts in the capacitance versus voltage hysteresis curves. Sputtering at high pressures (above 100 Pa) reduces the interfacial SiOx formation, according to the infrared spectra. The growth rates decrease with deposition pressure, so a very accurate control of the layer thicknesses could be provided. ",

However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and ADCs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and compares various analog memory technologies for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.

    "title": "Tracing quantum correlations back to collective interferences",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the possibility of explaining nonclassical correlations between two quantum systems in terms of quantum interferences between collective states of the two systems. We achieve this by mapping the relations between different measurement contexts in the product Hilbert space of a pair of two-level systems onto an analogous sequence of interferences between paths in a single-particle interferometer. The paradoxical relations between different measurement outcomes can then be traced to the distribution of probability currents in the interferometer. We show that the relation between probability currents and correlations can be represented by continuous conditional (quasi)probability currents through the interferometer, given by weak values; the violation of the noncontextual assumption is expressed by negative conditional currents in some of the paths. Since negative conditional currents correspond to the assignment of negative conditional probabilities to measurements results in different measurement contexts, the necessity of such negative probability currents represents a failure of noncontextual local realism. Our results help to explain the meaning of nonlocal correlations in quantum mechanics, and support Feynman's claim that interference is the origin of all quantum phenomena. ",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the channeling of fluorescence photons from quantum dots (QDs) into guided modes of an optical nanofiber tip (ONFT). We deposit QDs on the ONFT using micro/nano fluidic technology. We measure the photon-counting and emission spectrum of fluorescence photons that are channeled into guided modes of the ONFT. The measured emission spectrum confirms the deposition of QDs on the ONFT. We perform numerical simulations to determine channeling efficiency ({\\eta}) for the ONFT and a single dipole source (SDS) system. For the radially oriented SDS at the center of the facet of the ONFT, we found the maximum {\\eta}-value of 44% at the fiber size parameter of 7.16, corresponding to the ONFT radius of 0.71 {\\mu}m for the emission wavelength at 620 nm. Additionally, we investigate the SDS position dependence in transverse directions on the facet of the ONFT in view of keeping experimental ambiguities. The present fiber inline platform may open new avenues in quantum technologies. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature of the photoexcitation and ultrafast charge dynamics pathways in organic halide perovskite superlattices is key for their potential applications as tunable light emitters, photon harvesting materials and light-amplification systems. In this work we apply two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to track in real time the formation of near-infrared optical excitons and their ultrafast decay into bi-excitons in CH(NH2)2PbI3 nanocube superlattices. On the picosecond timescale, the strong coupling between localized charges and specific lattice distortions leads to the progressive formation of long-lived localized trap states. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the excitonic intrinsic linewidth, as extracted by the anti-diagonal components of the 2D spectra, unveils a dramatic change of the excitonic coherence time across the cubic to tetragonal structural transition. Our results offer a new way to control and enhance the ultrafast coherent dynamics of photocarrier generation in hybrid halide perovskite synthetic solids. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error correction methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. The manuscript introduces the basics of quantum error sources and explores the potential of using classical computation for error mitigation. The Yang-Baxter equation plays a crucial role, allowing us to compress time dynamics simulations into constant-depth circuits. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in correcting errors in time-evolving quantum states. ",

    "abstract": "As quantum technologies continue to advance, the simulation of open quantum dynamics using quantum algorithms has garnered increasing attention. In this paper, we present a universal and compact theory, the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ), for simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics. The DQME-SQ theory is not only inprinciple exact for both bosonic and fermionic environments that satisfy Gaussian statistics, but also possesses a compact form that facilitates quantum simulations. To demonstrate the practicality of the DQME-SQ theory, we conduct digital quantum simulations of spin-boson and Anderson impurity models, highlighting the significant non-Markovian dynamical effects. The proposed theoretical framework establishes a solid foundation for the accurate and efficient simulation of complex open quantum systems. ",

    "abstract": "Dark matter (DM) with masses of order an electronvolt or below can have a non-zero coupling to electromagnetism. In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell's equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We describe a new proposal for using integrated photonics to search for such DM candidates with masses in the 0.1 eV - few eV range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that can enable a novel and exciting experimental program. In particular, we show how refractive index-modulated resonators, such as grooved or periodically-poled microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by the DM, these modes can be read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of an ultra-quiet charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire. We then estimate the sensitivity of this experimental concept in the context of axion-like particle and dark photon models of DM, showing that the scaling and confinement advantages of nanophotonics may enable exploration of new DM parameter space.
