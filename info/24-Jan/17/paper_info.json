    "title": "Enhanced Twist-Averaging Technique for Magnetic Metals: Applications  using Quantum Monte Carlo",
    "abstract": "We propose an improved twist-averaging scheme for quantum Monte Carlo methods that use converged Kohn-Sham or Hartree-Fock orbitals as the reference. This twist-averaging technique is tailored to sample the Brillouin zone of magnetic metals, though it naturally extends to nonmagnetic conducting systems. The proposed scheme aims to reproduce the reference magnetization and achieves charge neutrality by construction, thus avoiding the large energy fluctuations and the post-processing needed to correct the energies. It shows the most robust convergence of total energy and magnetism to the thermodynamic limit when compared against four other twist-averaging schemes. Diffusion Monte Carlo applications are shown on nonmagnetic Al and ferromagnetic $\\alpha$-Fe. The cohesive energy of Al in the thermodynamic limit shows an excellent agreement with the experimental result. Furthermore, the magnetic moments in $\\alpha$-Fe exhibit rapid convergence with the increasing number of twists. ",

    "abstract": "Phase modulators are commonly used devices in optics. Free-space phase modulators are typically constructed from optically anisotropic crystals exhibiting the Pockels effect. To preserve the light's polarization state as it propagates through the crystal, it is essential to align the polarization and angle of incidence of the light with respect to the crystal. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of constructing free-space resonant phase modulators with a broad acceptance angle and minimal dependence on the polarization state of light using an acousto-optic approach. These modulators operate in the megahertz frequency range, require modest power levels, have aperture sizes exceeding one square centimeter, and feature sub-millimeter thickness. ",

    "abstract": "Experiments are performed to investigate the interaction of a vortex ring (Reynolds number based on circulation (Re gamma = 11500) with perforated surface (open area ratio, phi1 = 0.24 and phi2 = 0.44) with different included angles (theta = 60deg - 180deg ). The phenomenon is characterized using techniques like Planer Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) imaging and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Lagrangian analysis using finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and Gamma_2 vortex identification methods are utilised to understand the flow physics. Early observations reveal the growth of induced mushroom structures through the holes as a consequence of placing the perforated surface in the path of the vortex ring. These structures along with Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability imparts the initial instability to the emerging jets. We discern a sequential emergence of the vortex ring in the form of jets at lower theta value that diminishes at higher values. Except for theta = 150deg cases, where the flow from the two halves starts to talk resulting in a divergence in the circulation ratio, a reformed vortex ring is formed for all cases in the far downstream. A detailed discussion on the downstream vorticity dynamics has been been provided using vorticity contours, time-series variation of circulation and the FTLE fields. By varying the value of theta, we present a more generalised study of vortex ring interacting with perforated surfaces that finds application in multiple domains including flow control, manipulation and vortical cleaning.

Such a vectorial generalization extends the applicability of Chern-type bulk-boundary correspondence from one-dimensional (1D) edge states to two-dimensional (2D) surface states, whose unique features, such as forming nontrivial torus knots or links in the surface Brillouin zone, have been demonstrated recently in 3D photonic crystals. However, since it is still unclear how to achieve an arbitrary Chern vector, so far the surface-state torus knots or links can emerge, not on the surface of a single crystal as in other 3D topological phases, but only along an internal domain wall between two crystals with perpendicular Chern vectors. Here, we extend the 3D Chern insulator phase to acoustic crystals for sound waves, and propose a scheme to construct an arbitrary Chern vector that allows the emergence of surface-state torus knots or links on the surface of a single crystal. These results provide a complete picture of bulk-boundary correspondence for Chern vectors, and may find use in novel applications in topological acoustics. ",

Image processing is particularly important for observational astronomy, medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, big data and artificial intelligence. For these applications, signal processing traditionally has mainly been performed electronically. However these, as well as new applications, particularly those involving real time video image processing, are creating unprecedented demand for ultrahigh performance, including high bandwidth and reduced energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a photonic signal processor operating at 17 Terabits/s and use it to process video image signals in real-time. The system processes 400,000 video signals concurrently, performing 34 functions simultaneously that are key to object edge detection, edge enhancement and motion blur. As compared with spatial-light devices used for image processing, our system is not only ultra-high speed but highly reconfigurable and programable, able to perform many different functions without any change to the physical hardware. Our approach is based on an integrated Kerr soliton crystal microcomb, and opens up new avenues for ultrafast robotic vision and machine learning. ",

We achieve precise control over the thickness, length, and position of the GO films using a transfer-free, layer-by-layer coating method combined with accurate window opening in the chip cladding using photolithography. Detailed OPA measurements with a pulsed pump for the fabricated devices with different GO film thicknesses and lengths show a maximum parametric gain of ~24.0 dB, representing a ~12.2 dB improvement relative to the device without GO. We perform a theoretical analysis of the device performance, achieving good agreement with experiment and showing that there is substantial room for further improvement.

Here, we demonstrate an efficient electric-field tunable broadband source of entangled photons based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal. The emission rate and the polarization state of the photon pairs can be drastically altered by either applying a few volts or twisting the molecular orientation along the sample, enabling the generation of almost any polarization state.

This experiment provides access not only to the frequency of the detected vibrational modes, but also to their damping rate, which is obscured by inhomogeneous effects in measurements on ensembles of nano-objects. This allows a detailed analysis of the mechanical coupling occurring between two close nanoparticles (mediated by the polymer surrounding them) in the dimer case. Such coupling induces the hybridization of the vibrational modes of each nanoparticle, leading to the appearance in the Raman spectra of two ultra-low frequency modes corresponding to the out-of-phase longitudinal and transverse (with respect to the dimer axis) quasi-translations of the nanoparticles. Additionally, it is also shown to shift the frequency of the quadrupolar modes of the nanoparticles. Experimental results are interpreted using finite-element simulations, which enable the unambiguous identification of the detected modes and, despite the simplifications made, lead to a reasonable reproduction of their measured frequencies and quality factors. The demonstrated feasibility of low frequency Raman scattering experiments on single nano-objects opens up new possibilities to improve the understanding of nanoscale vibrations, this technique being complementary with single nano-object time-resolved spectroscopy as it gives access to different vibrational modes.

Here, we introduce an optical information hiding camera integrated with an electronic decoder, optimized jointly through deep learning. This information hiding-decoding system employs a diffractive optical processor as its front-end, which transforms and hides input images in the form of ordinary-looking patterns that deceive/mislead human observers. This information hiding transformation is valid for infinitely many combinations of secret messages, all of which are transformed into ordinary-looking output patterns, achieved all-optically through passive light-matter interactions within the optical processor. By processing these ordinary-looking output images, a jointly-trained electronic decoder neural network accurately reconstructs the original information hidden within the deceptive output pattern. We numerically demonstrated our approach by designing an information hiding diffractive camera along with a jointly-optimized convolutional decoder neural network. The efficacy of this system was demonstrated under various lighting conditions and noise levels, showing its robustness. We further extended this information hiding camera to multi-spectral operation, allowing the concealment and decoding of multiple images at different wavelengths, all performed simultaneously in a single feed-forward operation. The feasibility of our framework was also demonstrated experimentally using THz radiation. This optical encoder-electronic decoder-based co-design provides a novel information hiding camera interface that is both high-speed and energy-efficient, offering an intriguing solution for visual information security.

    "abstract": "The classical spin models attracts growing interests since many optimization problems can be mapped to searching the ground states of these models. However, solving such problems on conventional computers requires exponentially growing resources. In this work, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a photonic simulator for classical XY models. By encoding the XY spins on the phase term of the input light field, the corresponding XY Hamiltonian could be performed on the output light intensities. The simulator is mainly based on a programmable and reconfigurable optical vector-matrix multiplication system, which can map arbitrary XY models within the dimensionality limit. We first demonstrate the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a two-dimensional XY model, in which the expectation values of some observables are calculated and consistent with the theory. Besides, we performed the ground state search of two 25-spin XY models with different spin connections and coupling strengths. Our proposal paves a new way to investigate the XY spin system. ",

    "abstract": "Silicon photonic neural networks (PNNs) utilizing wavelength-multiplexing approaches, such as those based on micro-ring resonators (MRRs), offer superior performance due to their weight assignment, exceptional energy efficiency, and high computing density achieved through small device footprints. However, MRRs are highly sensitive to ambient disturbance, with even slight resonance drifts of tens of picometers potentially compromising MRRs-based PNNs. Current solutions often rely on complex control methods, resulting in high hardware complexity impractical for large-scale PNNs. Here, we propose a novel hardware-aware training and pruning approach. The core idea is to train the parameters of a physical neural network towards its noise-robust and energy-efficient region. This innovation enables control-free and energy-efficient photonic computing. Experimentally, this method improves computing precision by 4 bits without requiring intricate MRR control or power-consuming temperature stabilization circuits. It notably increases the accuracy of experimental handwritten digit classification from 67.0%, initially impacted by the thermal variances, to 95.0%, a figure comparable to the theoretical value and achieved without a thermoelectric controller. Additionally, this approach reduces the energy required to tune the MRRs ten-fold. Furthermore, our numerical verification indicates that this method is broadly applicable across various NN sizes and machine-learning tasks. Its effectiveness is particularly marked in larger NNs, where it boosts accuracy from 10.9% to 98.0% and slashes power consumption by 160 times. This advancement represents a significant step towards the practical, energy-efficient, and noise-resilient implementation of large-scale integrated PNNs. ",

    "abstract": "Photo-induced excited-state energy transfer (EET) processes play an important role in the solar energy conversions. The phenylene ethynylene (PE) dendrimers display great potential in improving the efficiency of solar cells, because of their excellent photo-harvesting and exciton-transport properties. In this work, we investigated the intramolecular EET dynamics in a dendrimer composed of two linear PE units (2-ring and 3-ring) using the full quantum dynamics based on the tensor network method. We first constructed a diabatic model Hamiltonian based on the electronic structure calculations. Using this diabatic vibronic coupling model, we tried to obtain the main features of the EET dynamics in terms of the several diabatic models with different numbers of vibrational modes (from 4 modes to 129 modes) and to explore the corresponding vibronic coupling interactions. The results show that the EET in the current PE dendrimer is an ultrafast process. Four modes with A' symmetry play dominant roles in the dynamics, other 86 modes with A' symmetry can damp the electronic coherence, and the modes of A\" symmetry do not show the significant influence on the EET process. Overall, the first-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms show the dominant roles in the EET dynamics, while the second-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms give the visible impact here by damping the electronic coherence and slowing down the overall EET process. This work provides a valuable understanding of the physical insight in the EET dynamics of PE dendrimers. ",

There, steep spatio-temporal gradients in the laser intensity expel seed particles from the high-intensity region and thus can prevent the onset of a cascade. We show that radially polarized laser pulses ensure that the seed electrons are present at the focal plane at the moment of the highest amplitude even in the case of extreme focusing. This feature reduces the required laser power for the onset of a cascade 100 times (80 times) compared to circularly (linearly) polarized laser pulses having the same focal spot radius and duration.

    "abstract": "Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) two-phase media are a special subset of hyperuniform structures with novel physical properties due to their hybrid crystal-liquid nature. We have previously shown that the strong-contrast expansion of a linear fractional form of the effective dynamic dielectric constant leads to accurate approximations for disordered two-phase composites when truncated at the two-point level for distinctly different microstructural symmetries in three dimensions. Here, we further elucidate the extraordinary optical and transport properties of disordered SHU media. Among other results, we prove in detail that SHU layered and transversely isotropic media are perfectly transparent (i.e., no Anderson localization, in principle) within finite wavenumber intervals through the third-order terms. Remarkably, the results for these SHU media imply that there can be no Anderson localization within the predicted perfect transparency interval in practice because the localization length is much larger than any practically large sample size. We further contrast and compare the extraordinary physical properties of SHU layered, transversely isotropic, and fully isotropic media to other model nonstealthy microstructures, including their attenuation characteristics, as measured by the imaginary part of effective dielectric constant, and transport properties, as measured by the time-dependent diffusion spreadability. We demonstrate cross-property relations between them: they are positively correlated as the structures span from nonhyperuniform, nonstealthy hyperuniform, and SHU media. Establishing cross-property relations for SHU media for other wave phenomena (e.g., elastodynamics) and transport properties will also be useful. Cross-property relations are generally useful because they enable one to estimate one property, given a measurement of another. ",

In this paper we analyze structures monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting single photons from ions, coupling them into integrated waveguides, and manipulating them via interference. We discuss practical considerations for realizing photon-mediated entanglement between trapped ions using these waveguide-based devices. ",

This paper explores their fundamental aspects, applications, and advancements, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of their potential in various applications.

The study emphasizes the critical role of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave propagation in enhancing light-matter interactions, contributing to high data rates, and enabling miniaturization. Additionally, it explores using two-dimensional materials like graphene for enhanced control in terahertz communication and sensing. The paper also introduces the employment of nanoantennas as the main building blocks of Nano-scale Radar (NR) systems for the first time in the literature. NRs, integrated with communication signals, promise accurate radar sensing for nanoparticles inside a nano-channel, making them a potential future application in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. These nano-scale radar systems detect and extract physical or electrical properties of nanoparticles through transmitting, receiving, and processing electromagnetic waves at ultra-high frequencies in the optical range. This task requires nanoantennas as transmitters/receivers/transceivers, sharing the same frequency band and hardware for high-performance sensing and resolution. ",

Among the possibilities currently investigated, quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage. This work shows potential advantages, both in terms of performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical Linguistics task: acceptability judgments. Acceptability judgment is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgment. The evaluation phase shows results for the quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers' capabilities to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future. ",

We analyze the site-resolved Rydberg state densities and the distribution of state occurrences. The site-resolved measurement reveals the formation of domain walls within the commensurate ordered phase, which subsequently proliferate and give rise to the floating phase with incommensurate quasi-long-range order. By analyzing the Fourier spectra of the Rydberg density-density correlations, we observe clear signatures of the incommensurate wave order of the floating phase. Furthermore, as the experimental system sizes increase, we show that the wave vectors approach a continuum of values incommensurate with the lattice. Our work motivates future studies to further explore the nature of commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions and their non-equilibrium physics. ",

The AO systems will need to perform at the fundamental limit in order to image Earth twins. A crucial component is the wavefront sensor. Interferometric wavefront sensors, such as the Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS), have been shown to perform close to the fundamental sensitivity limit. However, sensitivity comes at the cost of linearity; the ZWFS has strong nonlinear behavior. Aims: The aim of this work is to increase the dynamic range of Zernike-like wavefront sensors by using nonlinear reconstruction algorithms combined with phase sorting interferometry (PSI) and multi-wavelength measurements. Methods: The response of the ZWFS is explored analytically and numerically. Results: The proposed iterative (non)linear reconstructors reach the machine precision for small aberrations (<0.25 rad rms). Coupling the nonlinear reconstruction algorithm with PSI increases the dynamic range of the ZWFS by a factor of three to about 0.75 rad rms. Adding multiple wavebands doubles the dynamic range again, to 1.4 radians rms. Conclusion: The ZWFS is one of the most sensitive wavefront sensors, but has a limited dynamic range. The ZWFS will be an ideal second-stage wavefront sensor if it is combined with the proposed nonlinear reconstruction algorithm. ",
