    "abstract": "The process of constructing knowledge is typically taught to students by having them reproduce established results (e.g., homework problems). An alternative pedagogical strategy is to illustrate this process using an open problem, such as voltage decay in an RC circuit as described below. Analyzing data from this circuit in an undergraduate physics laboratory course reveals a discrepancy between the data and the exponential decay model found in textbooks. As students attempt to reconcile this discrepancy, the instructor can provide guidance in the process of validating data, modeling, and experimental design. This undergraduate laboratory exercise also provides an engaging transition from classroom learning to real world experience. ",

The trial function is expanded in a basis set of optimized Slater-type orbitals, resulting in highly accurate and converged eigen-energies up to $n=60$. We focus our studies on the microwave band 90-150 GHz, due to its relevance to laser excitation in the Earth's upper-atmospheric sodium layer for wavelength-dependent radiometry and polarimetry, as precise microwave polarimetry in this band is an important source of systematic uncertainty in searches for signatures of primordial gravitational waves within the anisotropic polarization pattern of photons from the cosmic microwave background. We present the most efficient transition coefficients in this range, as well as the scalar and tensor polarizabilities compared with available experimental and theoretical data. ",

    "abstract": "The chiral organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are vital candidates for superior nonlinear optical (NLO) effects associated with circularly polarized (CP) light. NLO in chiral materials often couples with magnetic dipole (MD) transition, as well as the conventional electric dipole (ED) transition. However, the importance of MD in NLO process of chiral OIHPs has not yet been well recognized. Here, the analysis of second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) provides the direct evidence that the MD contribution leads to a large anisotropic response to CP lights in chiral OIHPs, (R-/S-MBACl)2PbI4. The thin films exhibit great sensitivity to CP lights over a wide wavelength range, and the g-value reaches up to 1.57 at the wavelength where the contribution of MD is maximized. Furthermore, it is also effective as CP light generator, outputting CP-SHG with maximum g-factor of 1.76 upon the stimulation of linearly polarized light. This study deepens the understanding of the magneto-optical NLO processes in chiral systems. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) conventionally operates within high-performance magnetic shields due to the extremely weak magnetic field signals from the measured objects and the narrow dynamic range of the magnetic sensors employed for detection. This limitation results in elevated equipment costs and restricted usage. Additionally, the information obtained from MEG is functional images, and to analyze from which part of the brain the signals are coming, it is necessary to capture morphological images separately. When MEG and morphological imaging devices are separate, despite their individual high measurement accuracies, discrepancies in positional information may arise. In response, we have developed a low-field magnetic resonance imaging system that incorporates scalar-mode optically pumped magnetometers with a wide dynamic range and exceptionally high measurement sensitivity as sensors for MEG. Operating at low magnetic fields eliminates the need for superconducting coils in magnetic resonance imaging and the high-performance magnetic shields essential for MEG, promising a substantial cost reduction compared to traditional approaches. We achieved a noise level of about 16 pT/Hz^(1/2) with a single channel magnetometer, and reached a noise level of 367 fT/cm/Hz^(1/2) through differential measurements. The system successfully conducted MR imaging on a phantom, demonstrating the potential of MEG and MRI fusion. ",

    "abstract": "Fluxgate sensors are widely used in the field of low frequency and weak vector magnetic field measurement because of their good performance, such as high resolution and low power consumption. However, during the long-term continuous observation, the drift errors of the fluxgate sensor will occur due to the variable ambient temperature. This paper proposes a temperature compensation method for fluxgate sensors based on polynomial fitting. First, a physical model of the temperature & fluxgate sensor was established on the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation platform, and the influence of temperature on the measurement performance of the fluxgate sensor was analyzed. Second, according to the existing temperature-magnetic field data, a temperature compensation model of the fluxgate sensor was constructed. And compared it with other temperature compensation method, the result shows that the proposed temperature compensation method is relatively simple and can better achieve real-time compensation for sensor application scenarios. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerous laboratory experiments were implemented. The temperature drift is reduced from more than 500 nT before compensation to about 1 nT. The results show that the proposed method has a good temperature compensation effect on the data measured by the fluxgate sensor within a variable temperature background. ",

    "abstract": "The valley degree of freedom is one of the most intriguing properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Together with the possibility to address this degree of freedom by valley-contrasting optical selection rules, it has the potential to enable a completely new class of future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Resonant optical nanostructures emerge as promising tools for controlling the valley degree of freedom at the nanoscale. However, a critical understanding gap remains in how nanostructures and their nearfields affect the polarization properties of valley-selective chiral emission hindering further developments in this field. In order to address this issue, our study delves into the experimental investigation of a hybrid model system where valley-specific chiral emission from monolayer molybdenum disulfide is interacting with a resonant plasmonic nanosphere. Contrary to the intuition suggesting that a centrosymmetric nanoresonator preserves the degree of circular polarization in the farfield, our cryogenic photoluminescence microscopy reveals almost complete depolarization. We rigorously study the nature of this phenomenon numerically considering the monolayer-nanoparticle interaction at different levels including excitation and emission. We find that the farfield degree of polarization strongly reduces in the hybrid system when including excitons emitting from outside of the system's symmetry point, which in combination with depolarisation at the excitation level causes the observed effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatially distributed chiral emitters for precise predictions of polarization responses in these hybrid systems. This finding advances our fundamental knowledge of the light-valley interactions at the nanoscale but also unveils a serious impediment of the practical fabrication of resonant valleytronic nanostructures.

    "abstract": "We present a system consisting of two stacked chiral plasmonic nanoelements, so-called triskelia, that exhibits a high degree of circular dichroism. The optical modes arising from the interactions between the two elements are the main responsible for the dichroic signal. Their excitation in the absorption cross section is favored when the circular polarization of the light is opposite to the helicity of the system, so that an intense near-field distribution with 3D character is excited between the two triskelia, which in turn causes the dichroic response. Therefore, the stacking, in itself, provides a simple way to tune both the value of the circular dichroism, up to 60%, and its spectral distribution in the visible and near infrared range. We show how these interaction-driven modes can be controlled by finely tuning the distance and the relative twist angle between the triskelia, yielding maximum values of the dichroism at 20{\\deg} and 100{\\deg} for left- and right-handed circularly polarized light, respectively. Despite the three-fold symmetry of the elements, these two situations are not completely equivalent since the interplay between the handedness of the stack and the chirality of each single element breaks the symmetry between clockwise and anticlockwise rotation angles around 0{\\deg}. This reveals the occurrence of clear helicity-dependent resonances. The proposed structure can be thus finely tuned to tailor the dichroic signal for applications at will, such as highly efficient helicity-sensitive surface spectroscopies or single-photon polarization detectors, among others.

    "abstract": "Intense ultrashort laser pulse irradiation of solid targets was systematically investigated at the first-principles level, both theoretically and computationally. In the method, the propagation of a pulsed light through a thin film is described by a one-dimensional Maxwell's equation, and the microscopic electronic motion at different positions in the film is described by employing first-principles time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The method uses a coarse-graining approximation to couple light propagation and electronic motion, and is termed the multiscale Maxwell-TDDFT method. The reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance of pulsed light incident normally on thin films of 50-200 nm thickness were calculated for materials with different optical properties, such as aluminum (simple metal), graphite (semi-metal), silicon (small-gap dielectric), and quartz (wide-gap dielectric). Optical response transitions were explored as the light intensity shifted from the linear regime, represented by the dielectric function for weak light, to the extremely nonlinear regime, represented by plasma reflection under intense light conditions. Numerous mechanisms that depend on the laser pulse intensity and material type were found to contribute to these changes. These include multiphoton absorption, saturable absorption, sign change of the effective dielectric constant, and transition from quantum occupation to classical Boltzmann distribution. Thus, the calculations provide a unified understanding of the interaction of intense pulsed light with solids, occurring on an extremely short time scale. ",

The novel Wave-graphene exhibits full-auxetic behavior due to anisotropic mechanical response, possessing both negative and zero Poisson's ratios. The fundamental mechanism can be attributed to the fact that highly buckled out-of-plane structures lead to anisotropic responses of in-plane nonlinear interactions, which further lead to anisotropy of lattice vibrations. In addition, Wave-graphene is found having quasi-direct wide bandgap of 2.01 eV, the excellent optical transparency and the high flexibility. The successful design of Wave-graphene with excellent outstanding multifunctional properties shows that the utilization of space bending strategies can provide more degrees of freedom for designing novel materials, further enriching the carbon material family and supplementing its versatility.

Additionally, a mathematically equivalent approach to QNG, known as the stochastic reconfiguration method, has been implemented to enhance the performance of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It is worth noting that these methods are based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, which is one of the monotone metrics. So far, monotonicity has been believed to be a guiding principle to construct a geometry in physics. In this paper, we propose generalized QNG by removing the condition of monotonicity. Initially, we demonstrate that monotonicity is a crucial condition for conventional QNG to be optimal. Subsequently, we provide analytical and numerical evidence showing that non-monotone QNG outperforms conventional QNG based on the SLD metric in terms of convergence speed. ",

Despite recent advances, the quest for a solver that can integrate nonlinear dynamical systems with a quantum advantage, whilst being realisable on available (or near-term) quantum hardware, is an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to transform a nonlinear dynamical system into a linear system, which we integrate with quantum algorithms. Key to the method is the Fokker-Planck equation, which is a non-normal partial differential equation. Three integration strategies are proposed: (i) Forward-Euler stepping by unitary block encoding; (ii) Schroedingerisation, and (iii) Forward-Euler stepping by linear addition of unitaries. We emulate the integration of prototypical nonlinear systems with the proposed quantum solvers, and compare the output with the benchmark solutions of classical integrators. We find that classical and quantum outputs are in good agreement. This paper opens opportunities for solving nonlinear differential equations with quantum algorithms. ",
