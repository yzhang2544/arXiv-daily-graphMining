    "title": "Physics-constrained convolutional neural networks for inverse problems  in spatiotemporal partial differential equations",
    "abstract": "We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover from the biased data the true state, which is the solution of the PDE. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a simple time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from biased data for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only 2\\% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations. ",

Recent theoretical advances unveiled a novel mechanism for tuning topological phases of polaritons by modifying the surrounding photonic environment (light-matter interactions) without altering the lattice structure. Here, by embedding a dimerized chain of microwave helical resonators (electric dipole emitters) in a metallic cavity waveguide, we report the pioneering observation of tunable topological phases of polaritons by varying the cavity width which governs the surrounding photonic environment and the strength of light-matter interactions. Moreover, we experimentally identified a new type of topological phase transition which includes three non-coincident critical points in the parameter space: the closure of the polaritonic bandgap, the transition of the Zak phase, and the hybridization of the topological edge states with the bulk states. These results reveal some remarkable and uncharted properties of topological matter when strongly coupled to light and provide an innovative design principle for tunable topological photonic devices.

    "abstract": "Due to the necessity of making a series of fine adjustments after mode-locking in most experiments for preparing soliton molecules, the repeatability of the preparations remains a challenge. Here, we propose a novel all-polarization-maintaining erbium-doped fiber laser that utilizes a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror for mode-locking and features a linear structure. This laser can stably output soliton molecules without any additional adjustment once the mode-locking self-starts. It can achieve all-optical switching to single-pulse operation through changing the pumping power, making it suitable for studying the mechanism of soliton molecule bond rupture. In addition, multi-pulse operation can also be achieved. Compared to the single-pulse state, this laser is operated in the multi-pulse state at a lower pumping power level, in contrast to previous methods that relied on increasing pumping power to generate multi-pulses. As a result, these multi-pulses are not susceptible to spectral distortion caused by nonlinear effects and maintain pulse stability close to that of the single-pulse. Furthermore, as the pumping power decreases, a peak with periodic intensity variation appears in the spectral center of both the single-pulse state and multi-pulse states. Combined with the experimental facts, we propose a multistability model to explain this phenomenon. With its ability to switch between soliton molecule, soliton, and multi-pulse states, this flexible laser can serve as a versatile toolbox for studying soliton dynamics. ",

We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion. ",

    "abstract": "The continuous growth in data volume has sparked interest in silicon-organic-hybrid (SOH) nanophotonic devices integrated into silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). SOH devices offer improved speed and energy efficiency. However, a comprehensive and accurate modeling methodology for SOH devices, with corroborating experimental results, is lacking. While a few preliminary modeling approaches for SOH devices exist, their dependence on theoretical and numerical methodologies, along with a lack of compatibility with electronic design automation (EDA), hinders their seamless, rapid, and cost-effective integration with silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Here, we develop a phenomenological, building-block-based SOH PICs simulation methodology, from physics to system level, offering high accuracy, comprehensiveness, and EDA-style compatibility. Our model is also readily integrable and scalable, lending itself to the design of large-scale silicon PICs. Our modeling methodology is agnostic and compatible with any photonics-electronics co-simulation software. We validate our methodology by comparing the experimentally demonstrated SOH microring modulators (MRMs) and Mach Zehnder modulators (MZMs) with simulation results, also showing its ability to model various modulator topologies. We demonstrate our methodology's ease, speed, and low computational cost in modeling large-scale systems though design and simulation of a 3-channel SOH MRM-based wavelength-division (de)multiplexer (WDM) as a showcase example. WDM is a widely used component in various applications, including neuromorphic computing, data center interconnects, and sensing. Our modeling approach is compatible with other materials exhibiting the Pockels and Kerr effects. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive physics-to-system-level EDA-compatible simulation methodology for SOH modulators. ",

Accompanied by analytical results, we identify a coupling mechanism mediated simultaneously by the two perpendicular polarizations, and inducing polaritonic relaxation towards molecular rotations. This mechanism is related to the concept of light-induced conical intersections (LICI). However, unlike LICIs, these non-adiabatic pathways are of collective nature, since they depend on the \\emph{relative} intermolecular orientation of all electronic transition dipoles in the polarization plane. Notably, this rotational mechanism directly couples the bright upper and lower polaritonic states, and it stays in direct competition with the collective relaxation towards dark-states. Our simulations indicate that the molecular rotational dynamics in gas-phase cavity-coupled systems can serve as a novel probe for non-radiative polaritonic decay towards the dark-states manifold. ",

The Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase has been extensively exploited in metasurfaces to realize multiple spin-dependent functionalities, such as the circularly polarized (CP) beam steering, focusing, holography, etc. However, the ever-increasing demand for PB metasurfaces in complex environments has simultaneously brought about one challenging problem, i.e., the interference of multiple wave channels, which limits the performance of various PB metadevices. One possible solution is developing nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces with the optical isolation property. Here, we present a magnetic-field-biased nonreciprocal PB metasurface composed of elliptical dielectric cylinders and a thin YIG layer, which can achieve nearly 92% and 81% isolation rates of CP lights at 5.5 GHz and 6.5 GHz, respectively. The high isolation of this metasurface is attributed to the enhancement of the Faraday-magnetic-optical (FMO) effect by the resonant coupling between the dielectric Mie modes and the Fabry-P\\'erot (FP) cavity mode. We apply the PB phase and nonreciprocity of the metasurface to achieve unidirectional manipulation of the wavefront of CP light beams. This gives rise to two types of metadevices: the metadeflector with nonreciprocal beam steering, and the metalens with nonreciprocal beam focusing. The proposed PB metasurface can enable efficient wavefront control while isolating the undesired wave channels, thus promising highly useful applications in optical communications, optical sensing, and quantum information processing.

This localization results from the perfect, destructive interference of light emitted from different positions and, because of that, occurs only at very specific frequencies. Here, we examine this localization regime in the presence of standard optical Kerr non-linearities, such as those found in polaritonic lattices, and show that they stabilize driven-dissipative localization across frequency ranges significantly broader than those observed in the linear regime. Moreover, we demonstrate that, contrary to intuition, in most siutations this driven-dissipative localization does not enhance non-linear effects like optical bistabilities, due to a concurrent reduction in overall intensities. Nevertheless, we are able to identify certain parameter regions where non-linear enhancement is achieved, corresponding to situations where emission from different spots constructively interferes. ",

We propose to use the \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \\textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m.

    "abstract": "We are developing the Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC) of the ATHENA X-IFU spectrometer. It is a TES-based particle detector aimed to reduce the background of the instrument. Here, we present the result obtained with the last CryoAC single-pixel prototype. It is based on a 1 cm2 silicon absorber sensed by a single 2mm x 1mm Ir/Au TES, featuring an on-chip heater for calibration and diagnostic purposes. We have illuminated the sample with 55Fe (6 keV line) and 241Am (60 keV line) radioactive sources, thus studying the detector response and the heater calibration accuracy at low energy. Furthermore, we have operated the sample in combination with a past-generation CryoAC prototype. Here, by analyzing the coincident detections between the two detectors, we have been able to characterize the background spectrum of the laboratory environment and disentangle the primary (i.e. cosmic muons) and secondaries (mostly secondary photons and electrons) signatures in the spectral shape.
