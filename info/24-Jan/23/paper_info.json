    "abstract": "We show that, as in the case of the principle of minimum action in classical and quantum mechanics, there exists an even more general principle in the very fundamental structure of {\\it quantum space-time}: This is the principle of {\\it minimal group representation} that allows to consistently and simultaneously obtain a natural description of the spacetime dynamics and the physical states admissible in it. The theoretical construction is based on the physical states, average values of the Metaplectic group $Mp(n)$ generators: the double covering of $SL(2C)$ in a vector representation, with respect to the {\\it coherent states} carrying the spin weight. Our main results here are: (i) A connection between the Metaplectic symmetry generators and the physical state dynamics. (ii) The ground states are coherent states, of Perelomov-Klauder type of the Metaplectic group dividing the Hilbert space into {\\it even} and {\\it odd} states. (iii) The physical states have spin contents $s = 0,\\; 1/2, \\;1,\\; 3/2$ and $2$. (iv) The generators introduce a natural supersymmetry and a superspace whose line element is the geometrical Lagrangian of our model. (v) A coherent physical state of spin 2 is obtained naturally related to the metric tensor. (vi) This is {\\it naturally discretized} by the discrete series in the $n$ number representation, reaching the classical (continuous) space-time for $n$ $\\rightarrow\\infty$. (vii) A relation emerges between the coherent state metric eigenvalue $\\alpha$ and the black hole entropy through the Planck length. The lowest level of the quantum space-time spectrum, $n = 0$ and its characteristic length, yields a minimum entropy for the black hole history. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic crystal fiber (PCF)-based plasmonic sensors have gained considerable attention because of their highly sensitive performance and broad range of sensing regimes. In this work, a relatively simple ultra-sensitive PCF-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor has been proposed for detecting different analyte refractive indices (RIs) ranging from 1.33 to 1.43 over a wide range of wavelength spectrum spanning 0.55 $\\mu$m to 3.50 $\\mu$m. The comprehensive finite-element simulations indicate that it is possible to achieve remarkable sensing performances such as wavelength sensitivity (WS) and figure of merit (FOM) as high as 123,000 nm/RIU and 683 RIU$^{-1}$, respectively, and extremely low values of wavelength resolution (WR) of 8.13 x 10$^{-8}$ RIU. In addition, a novel artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed to be integrated into the practical setup in order to accurately predict the RIs by carefully examining the simulation data. The mean square error (MSE) and accuracy ($R^2$) values for the ANN model are found about 0.0097 and 0.9987, respectively, indicating the high prediction capability of the proposed ANN model. Due to its exceptional sensitivity and precise detection capabilities, the proposed device has the potential to serve as a viable option for sensing analyte refractive index (RI). Additionally, the sensor could be utilized for identifying cancerous cells and detecting urinary tract infections in humans. ",

Turbulence can be pictured as a tangle of vortex filaments in superfluids and viscous vortices in classical fluids. However, it is hard to explain how the statistical properties of turbulence arise from elemental structures. Here we use the quantum vortex tangle as a skeleton to generate an instantaneous classical turbulent field with intertwined vortex tubes. Combining the quantum skeleton and tunable vortex thickness makes the synthetic turbulence satisfy key statistical laws and provides valuable insights for elucidating energy cascade and extreme events. By manipulating the elemental structures, we customize turbulence with desired statistical features. This bottom-up approach of \"weaving\" turbulence provides a testbed for analyzing and modeling turbulence. ",

    "abstract": "Solid-state electronics have revolutionized modern society due to their exceptional computational capabilities. However, the power consumption of chips rises dramatically with increasing integration levels as post-treatment of individual computing unit cost. Here, we introduce a water computing chip with exceptionally low power consumption based on graphene/water/semiconductor photodetectors, which relies on a unique exponential decay of water molecule polarization transfer function (PTF) along the signal transmission direction. Through a designed Ising model to picture the dynamic polarization and depolarization process of water molecules between graphene and silicon, we illustrate a longitude decay PTF which guarantees low energy consumption for the pulse current output. Furthermore, the lateral decay PTF is verified by the realization of linearly superimposed currents in the diameter of centimeter scale based on 3*3 water photodetector array. The molecular dynamic simulations reveal the timescale of 25 femtosecond (fs) for one flip of single water molecule. Subsequently, the single logical operation only needs an ideal energy consumption up to attojoule (10-18 J). The decay of lateral PTF at the centimeter scale ensures the ability to fabricate water computing chips containing a large number of photodetector arrays under micro/nano fabrication technology, which mimics the numerous neural cells inside hippocampus. As a proof of concept, we show the capability for Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) computations using an 8*8 water computing chip by successfully identifying the ASCII code of ZJU. The water computing chips utilize naturally-sourced water and straightforward manufacturing techniques, which hold great potential in creating a chip similar with human brain. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional and recently developed approaches for estimating turbulent scalar fluxes under stable conditions are evaluated. The focus is on methods that do not require fast scalar sensors such as the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) approach, the disjunct eddy-covariance (DEC) approach, and a novel mixing length parametrization labelled as A22. Using high-frequency measurements collected from two contrasting sites (Utqiagvik, Alaska and Wendell, Idaho \"during winter\"), it is shown that the REA and A22 models outperform the conventional Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) utilized in Earth System Models. With slow trace gas sensors used in disjunct eddy-covariance (DEC) approaches and the more complex signal filtering associated with REA devices (here simulated using filtered signals from fast-response sensors), A22 outperforms REA and DEC in predicting the observed unfiltered (total) eddy-covariance (EC) fluxes. However, REA and DEC can still capture the observed filtered EC fluxes computed with the filtered scalar signal. This finding motivates the development of a correction, blending the REA and DEC methods, for the underestimated net averaged fluxes to incorporate the effect of sensor filtering. The only needed parameter for this correction is the mean velocity at the instrument height, a surrogate of the advective timescale. ",

The real part indicates the intrinsic oscillation frequency while the imaginary part the Landau damping rate. In most of the literatures, the normal modes of quantum plasmas are obtained by means of small damping approximation (SDA), which is invalid for high-$k$ modes. In this paper, we solve the exact dispersion relations via the analytical continuation (AC) scheme, and, due to the multi-value nature of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, reformation of the complex Riemann surface is required. It is found that the change of the topological shape of the root locus in quantum plasmas is quite different from classical plasmas, in which both real and imaginary frequencies of high-$k$ modes increase with $k$ in a steeper way than the typical linear behaviour as appears in classical plasmas. As a result, the temporal evolution of a high-$k$ perturbation in quantum plasmas is dominated by the ballistic modes. ",

Explicitly correlated Gaussian (ECG) basis functions have proved successful for non-BO calculations of stationary molecular states and energies, reproducing rovibrational absorption spectra with very high accuracy. In this paper, we present a proof-of-principle study of the ability of fully flexible ECGs (FFECGs) to capture the intricate electronic and rovibrational dynamics generated by short, high-intensity laser pulses. By fitting linear combinations of FFECGs to accurate wave function histories obtained on a large real-space grid for a regularized 2D model of the hydrogen atom and for the 2D Morse potential we demonstrate that FFECGs provide a very compact description of laser-driven electronic and rovibrational dynamics.

This robustness is crucial as it enables, amongst others, using microscope objectives with short working distances to perform wide field imaging/sensing with bulk diamonds.

The files required to reproduce this antenna, which can be built on a standard and affordable double sided PCB, are provided open-source.

This work aims to explore the melting heat transfer characteristics of salty ice in a square cavity filled with homogeneous porous media subjected to lateral heating. In order to facilitate the visualization of melting dynamics in a uniform porous media, a three-dimensional (3D) printed transparent cavity filled with porous matrix was manufactured, featuring an open upper end. Aqueous solutions of sodium chloride at concentration both higher and lower than the eutectic concentration were investigated. Lateral heating experiments with constant heat flux were conducted in a subzero temperature environment. The effect of heating power, initial concentrations and different sizes of porous matrix was investigated. Distinct phenomena were observed based on the concentration of the aqueous solution. Specifically, the concentration lower than the eutectic concentration results in an upward bending melting interface. Whereas the concentration surpassing the eutectic concentration resulted in a downward bending melting interface. In the presence of salt, a melting convex appears at the bottom of the melting interface and manifests during the whole melting process. Notably, smaller matrix enables faster melting rate. Furthermore, three distinct stages were revealed in our experiments, characterized as conduction, mixture of conduction and ultimately convection stage. The correlations for Nu and the average propagation rate of mushy/liquid interface were established by order of magnitude analysis and fit well with the experiments. ",

While the ordered phase relies on non-reciprocal meta-atoms - whose breaking of the out-of-plane symmetry enables the confinement of visible light in air, the disordered phase exploits global plasmonic network modes and their ability to localize energy at nanometric scales. By generating configurable structural colors with extra-ordinary resolution, we demonstrate that coupling of these elements provides a new dimension in the design space. We showcase that control of the local light-matter interaction enables the creation of intricate, customizable optical patterns, which open new avenues for information encoding and high-security features.

The pair production via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in such a high-energy environment eliminates part of the $\\gamma$-photons in the outgoing $\\gamma$-beam, increasing the statistical error and decreasing the accuracy of this VP signal.

    "abstract": "The interaction of excitonic transitions with confined photonic modes enables tests of quantum physics and design of efficient optoelectronic devices. Here we study how key metrics such as Purcell factor, beta-factor and collection efficiency are determined by the non-cavity modes which exist in real devices, taking the well-studied micropillar cavity as an example. Samples with dots at different positions in the cavity field allow us to quantify the effect of the non-cavity modes and show that the zero-phonon line and the phonon-assisted emission into the cavity mode HE11 is suppressed by positioning dots at the field node.

    "title": "Effects of Different Q-swaps Modes on Percolation Threshold in  Small-world Quantum Networks",
    "abstract": "Quantum networks are interconnected by nodes, between singlets which are formed to ensure the successful transmission of information with a probability of 1. However, in real quantum networks, nodes often share a partially entangled state instead of a singlet due to factors such as environmental noise. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the partially entangled state into a singlet for efficient communication. Percolation happens during the conversion of connected edges in the whole network. As a result, when the singlet conversion probability (SCP) is greater than the percolation threshold, a giant interconnected cluster that meets the basic requirements of communication will appear in the network. The percolation threshold of the network reveals the minimum resources required to carry out large scale quantum communication. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different q-swaps on the percolation threshold in quantum entanglement percolation of small world networks. We show that Quantum Entanglement Percolation (QEP) has a better percolation performance than Classical Entanglement Percolation (CEP). By using different q swaps in Watts Strogatz (WS) small world networks and Kleinberg networks for simulation, we also show that the percolation threshold is minimized when SCP is equal to the average degree of the network. Furthermore, we introduce quantum walk as a new scheme to have an extra reduction in the percolation threshold. ",

    "abstract": "We consider instability and localized patterns arising from long wave-short wave (LWSW) resonance in the non-integrable regime numerically. We study the stability and instability of elliptic-function periodic waves with respect to subharmonic perturbations, whose period is a multiple of the period of the elliptic waves. We thus find the modulational instability (MI) of the corresponding dnoidal waves. Upon varying parameters of dnoidal waves, spectrally unstable ones can be transformed into stable states via the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation. For snoidal waves, we find a transition of the dominant instability scenario between the MI and instability with a bubble-like spectrum. For cnoidal waves, we produce three variants of the MI. Evolution of the unstable states is also considered, leading to formation of rogue waves on top of the elliptic-wave and continuous-wave backgrounds. ",

    "title": "Quantum Eigensolver for General Matrices",
    "abstract": "The eigenvalue problem, a cornerstone in linear algebra, provides profound insights into studying matrix properties. Quantum algorithms addressing this problem have hitherto been constrained to special normal matrices assuming spectral decomposition, leaving the extension to general matrices an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel family of quantum algorithms tailored for solving the eigenvalue problem for general matrices, encompassing scenarios with complex eigenvalues or even defective matrices. Our approach begins by tackling the task of searching for an eigenvalue without additional constraints. For diagonalizable matrices, our algorithm has $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity with an error $\\varepsilon$, achieving the nearly Heisenberg scaling. Subsequently, we study the identification of eigenvalues closest to a specified point or line, extending the results for ground energy and energy gap problems in Hermitian matrices. We achieve an accuracy scaling of $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ for general diagonalizable matrices, further refining to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ under the condition of real eigenvalues or constant distance from the reference point. The algorithm's foundation lies in the synergy of three techniques: the relationship between eigenvalues of matrix $A$ and the minimum singular value of $A-\\mu I$, quantum singular value threshold subroutine extended from quantum singular-value estimation, and problem-specific searching algorithms. Our algorithms find applications in diverse domains, including estimating the relaxation time of Markov chains, solving Liouvillian gaps in open quantum systems, and verifying PT-symmetry broken/unbroken phases. These applications underscore the significance of our quantum eigensolvers for problems across various disciplines. ",

Launched in December 2022, Lunar Flashlight (LF) was a NASA-funded technology demonstration mission. After a propulsion system anomaly prevented capture in lunar orbit, LF was ejected from the Earth-Moon system and into heliocentric space. NASA subsequently transferred ownership of LF to Georgia Tech to conduct an unfunded extended mission to demonstrate further advanced technology objectives, including LONEStar. From August-December 2023, the LONEStar team performed on-orbit calibration of the optical instrument and a number of different OPNAV experiments. This campaign included the processing of nearly 400 images of star fields, Earth and Moon, and four other planets (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). LONEStar provided the first on-orbit demonstrations of heliocentric navigation using only optical observations of planets. Of special note is the successful in-flight demonstration of (1) instantaneous triangulation with simultaneous sightings of two planets with the LOST algorithm and (2) dynamic triangulation with sequential sightings of multiple planets.
