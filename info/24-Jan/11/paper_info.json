    "abstract": "We present a novel theoretical formulation for performing quantum dynamics in terms of moments within the single-particle description. By expressing the quantum dynamics in terms of increasing orders of moments, instead of single-particle wave functions as generally done in time-dependent density functional theory, we describe an approach for reducing the high computational cost of simulating the quantum dynamics. The equation of motion is given for the moments by deriving analytical expressions for the first-order and second-order time derivatives of the moments, and a numerical scheme is developed for performing quantum dynamics by expanding the moments in the Taylor series as done in classical molecular dynamics simulation. We propose a few numerical approaches using this theoretical formalism on a simple one-dimensional model system, for which an analytically exact solution can be derived. Application of the approaches to an anharmonic system is also discussed to illustrate their generality. We also discuss the use of an artificial neural network model to circumvent the numerical evaluation of the second-order time derivatives of the moments, as analogously done in the context of classical molecular dynamics simulations.

    "abstract": "Optical tweezers constitute pivotal tools in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical(AMO) physics, facilitating precise trapping and manipulation of individual atoms and molecules. This process affords the capability to generate desired geometries in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces, while also enabling real-time reconfiguration of atoms. Due to stochastic defects in these tweezers, which cause catastrophic performance degradation especially in quantum computations, it is essential to rearrange the tweezers quickly and accurately. Our study introduces a machine learning approach that uses the Proximal Policy Optimization model to optimize this rearrangement process. This method focuses on efficiently solving the shortest path problem, ensuring the formation of defect-free tweezer arrays. By implementing machine learning, we can calculate optimal motion paths under various conditions, resulting in promising results in model learning. This advancement presents new opportunities in tweezer array rearrangement, potentially boosting the efficiency and precision of quantum computing research. ",

    "abstract": "Ion cyclotron resonance energization (ICRE) such as ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is widely applied to magnetic confinement fusion and high-power electric propulsion. Since ICRE involves cyclotron resonance processes, a kinetic model is required. Both conventional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and solving the Boltzmann equation require enormous computation and memory. The hybrid simulation incorporating of adiabatic electrons and PIC ions allows both a substantial reduction in computation and the inclusion of cyclotron resonance effects. Under the adiabatic electron approximation, we have developed a two-dimensional (r,z) hybrid electromagnetic (EM) PIC-MCC (Monte-Carlo collision) simulation program, named HYPIC. The advantages of HYPIC are the inclusion of ion kinetic effects, electrostatic (ES) and EM effects, and collisional effects of ions and electrons, with a small computation. The HYPIC program is able to fast simulate the antenna-plasma interactions and the ion cyclotron resonance energization and/or ion cyclotron resonance heating processes in linear devices, such as high-power electric propulsion, magnetic mirror, and field-reversed-configuration (FRC), etc. ",

In this paper, we introduce a novel device based on the MPLC concept, incorporating multi-layer locally birefringent metasurfaces, and present a general design formalism to realize complete vectorial mode conversion for arbitrary cases. The efficacy of the proposed method is confirmed through the demonstration of two distinctive devices: a mode-division-multiplexed dual-polarization coherent receiver and a spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography system. Due to its versatility, the demonstrated protocol can be applied to design a myriad of multi-input-multi-output devices, offering a powerful tool to realize universal optical mode converters for diverse applications.

    "abstract": "This research aims to model tracks the evolution of opinions among agents and their collective dynamics, and mathematically represents the resonance of opinions and echo chamber effects within the filter bubble by including non-physical factors such as misinformation and confirmation bias, known as FP ghosting phenomena.The indeterminate ghost phenomenon, a social science concept similar to the uncertainty principle, depicts the variability of social opinion by incorporating information uncertainty and nonlinearities in opinion formation into the model. Furthermore, by introducing the Kubo formula and the Matsubara form of the Green's function, we mathematically express temporal effects and model how past, present, and future opinions interact to reveal the mechanisms of opinion divergence and aggregation. Our model uses multiple parameters, including population density and extremes of opinion generated on a random number basis, to simulate the formation and growth of filter bubbles and their progression to ultraviolet divergence phenomena. In this process, we observe how resonance or disconnection of opinions within a society occurs via a disconnection function (type la, lb, ll, lll). However, the interpretation of the results requires careful consideration, and empirical verification is a future challenge.Finally, we will share our hypotheses and considerations for the model case of this paper, which is a close examination of regional differences in media coverage and its effectiveness and considerations unique to Japan, a disaster-prone country.

This has lead numerous suggestions for using these systems for sensing applications. However, there is an open debate as to whether or not this sensitivity advantage is negated by additional noise in the system. We show that an EP sensor's imprecision in measuring a generalized force is independent of its operating point's proximity to the EP. That is because frequency noises of fundamental origin in the sensor -- due to quantum and thermal fluctuations -- increase in a manner that exactly cancels the benefit of increased resonant frequency sensitivity near the EP. So the benefit of EP sensors is limited to the regime where sensing is limited by technical noises. Finally, we outline an EP sensor with phase-sensitive gain that does have an advantage even if limited by fundamental noises. ",

    "abstract": "Topology and interactions are foundational concepts in the modern understanding of quantum matter. Their nexus yields three significant research directions: competition between distinct interactions, as in the multiple intertwined phases, interplay between interactions and topology that drives the phenomena in twisted layered materials and topological magnets, and the coalescence of multiple topological orders to generate distinct novel phases. The first two examples have grown into major areas of research, while the last example remains mostly untouched, mainly because of the lack of a material platform for experimental studies. Here, using tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical analysis, we unveil a \"hybrid\" and yet novel topological phase of matter in the simple elemental solid arsenic. Through a unique bulk-surface-edge correspondence, we uncover that arsenic features a conjoined strong and higher-order topology, stabilizing a hybrid topological phase. While momentum-space spectroscopy measurements show signs of topological surface states, real-space microscopy measurements unravel a unique geometry of topology-induced step edge conduction channels revealed on various forms of natural nanostructures on the surface. Using theoretical models, we show that the existence of gapless step edge states in arsenic relies on the simultaneous presence of both a nontrivial strong Z2 invariant and a nontrivial higher-order topological invariant, providing experimental evidence for hybrid topology and its realization in a single crystal. Our discovery highlights pathways to explore the interplay of different kinds of band topology and harness the associated topological conduction channels in future engineered quantum or nano-devices.

A critical aspect of AMP functionality is their targeted interaction with pathogen membranes, which often possess altered lipid compositions. Designing AMPs with enhanced therapeutic properties relies on a nuanced understanding of these interactions, which are believed to trigger a rearrangement of these peptides from random coil to alpha-helical conformations, essential for their lytic action. Traditional supercomputing has consistently encountered difficulties in accurately modeling these structural changes, especially within membrane environments, thereby opening an opportunity for more advanced approaches. This study extends an existing quantum computing algorithm to address the complexities of antimicrobial peptide interactions at interfaces. Our approach enables the prediction of the optimal conformation of peptides located in the transition region between hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, akin to lipid membranes. The new method has been applied to model the structure of three 10-amino-acid-long peptides, each exhibiting hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or amphipathic properties in different media and at interfaces between solvents of different polarity. Notably, our approach does not demand a higher number of qubits compared to simulations in homogeneous media, making it more feasible with current quantum computing resources. Despite existing limitations in computational power and qubit accessibility, our findings demonstrate the significant potential of quantum computing in accurately characterizing complex biomolecular processes, particularly the folding of AMPs at membrane models.

It enables directional flow of signals and efficient noise suppression, constituting a key element in the architecture of current quantum information and computing systems. Here we explore its potential in optimizing the charging dynamics of a quantum battery. By introducing nonreciprocity through reservoir engineering during the charging process, we induce a directed energy flow from the quantum charger to the battery, resulting in a substantial increase in energy accumulation. Despite local dissipation, the nonreciprocal approach demonstrates a fourfold increase in battery energy compared to conventional charger-battery systems. We demonstrate that employing a shared reservoir can establish an optimal condition where nonreciprocity enhances charging efficiency and elevates energy storage in the battery. This effect is observed in the stationary limit and remains applicable even in overdamped coupling regimes, eliminating the need for precise temporal control over evolution parameters. Our result can be extended to a chiral network of quantum nodes, serving as a multi-cell quantum battery system to enhance storage capacity. The proposed approach is straightforward to implement using current state-of-the-art quantum circuits, both in photonics and superconducting quantum systems. In a broader context, the concept of nonreciprocal charging has significant implications for sensing, energy capture, and storage technologies or studying quantum thermodynamics. ",
