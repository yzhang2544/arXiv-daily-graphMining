    "abstract": "The recent identification of a modulation of acoustic waves that is driven by spatial velocity gradients, using acoustic black and white hole analogues [Schenke et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 154 (2023), 781-791], has shed new light on the complex interplay of acoustic waves and non-uniform flows. According to the virtual acoustic black hole hypothesis, these findings should be applicable to acoustic waves propagating in non-uniform flows of arbitrary velocity. In this study, the propagation of acoustic waves in non-uniform flows is investigated by incorporating a leading-order model of the acoustic pressure modulation into a Lagrangian wave tracking algorithm. Using this numerical method, the acoustic pressure modulation is recovered accurately in non-uniform subsonic flows. This suggests that spatial velocity gradients drive acoustic pressure modulations in any non-uniform flow, which can, as shown here, be readily quantified. ",

    "abstract": "Cavity optomechanical devices can be made to have good compatibility with optical fiber technology by utilizing fiber-based waveguides and cavities and can be used in high-performance optical sensor applications. Such optomechanical microsensors have a great potential for exploring the properties of liquids, such as density, viscosity, and masses of included nanoparticles. However, as yet, there is no cavity optomechanical architecture that can be used to sense the liquid's shape, e.g., liquid level. In this paper, we report a demonstration of a liquid-level meter using a twin-microbottle resonator that can make measurements at arbitrary positions and depths in the liquid. The twin-microbottle resonator has a maximum diameter of 68 $\\mu$m and length of 800 $\\mu$m. By immersing one part of it in water and keeping the other part in air, the mechanical radial breathing mode can be read out sensitively while maintaining a high optical quality factor of the optical whispering gallery mode regardless of the water immersion. This high mechanical displacement sensitivity provides a frequency resolution that is high enough to measure the mechanical frequency shift due to the water immersion and resolves the water level to 2.6$\\pm$0.9 pm. This unique liquid-level meter based on a highly sensitive cavity optomechanical setup can be used to detect tiny fluctuations of various air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces. ",

    "abstract": "As one indispensable type of nonreciprocal mechanism, a system with temporal modulations is intrinsically open in the physical sense and inevitably non-Hermitian, but the space and time degrees of freedom are nonseparable in a large variety of circumstances, which restrains the non-Bloch band theory to apply. Here, we investigate the spatially photonic crystals (PhCs) composed of spatiotemporal modulation materials (STMs) and homogeneous media, dubbed as the STM-PhC, wherein the spatial and temporal modulations are deliberately designed to be correlated. To bypass the difficulty of the spatiotemporal correlation, we first employ the effective medium theory to account for the dispersion of fundamental bands under the influence of Floquet sidebands. Based on the dynamical degeneracy splitting viewpoint and continuum generalized Brillouin zone condition, we then analytically give the criteria for the existence of the non-Hermitian skin effect in the STM. Assisted by developing a numerical method that embeds the plane wave expansion in the transfer matrix, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for the low-frequency Floquet bands in the STM-PhCs, in which the central is the identification of the generalized Brillouin zone. We finally delve into the topological properties, including non-Bloch Zak phases and delocalization of topologically edge states. Our work validates that effective medium assists the non-Bloch band theory applied to the STM-PhCs, which delivers a prescription to broaden the horizons of non-Bloch theory. ",

However, achieving acoustic waveguides with low loss, tailorability, and easy fabrication remains a challenge. Here, inspired by the optical anti-resonance in hollow-core fibers, we propose suspended anti-resonant acoustic waveguides (SARAWs) with superior confinement and high selectivity of acoustic modes, supporting both forward and backward SBS on chip. Furthermore, this structure streamlines the design and fabrication processes. Leveraging the advantages of SARAWs, we have showcased a series of record-breaking results for SBS within a compact footprint on the silicon-on-insulator platform. For forward SBS, a centimeter-scale SARAW supports a large net gain exceeding 6.4 dB. For backward SBS, we have observed an unprecedented Brillouin frequency shift of 27.6 GHz and a mechanical quality factor of up to 1,960 in silicon waveguides. This paradigm of acoustic waveguide propels SBS into a new era, unlocking new opportunities in the fields of optomechanics, phononic circuits, and hybrid quantum systems. ",

Additionally, an electrostatic model has been developed to investigate the relationship between the ion trap geometrical tolerances and the trapping efficiency.

To date, however, chromatic dispersion has mostly limited output wavelengths to >560 nm, and robust access to the whole green light spectrum has not been demonstrated. In fact, wavelengths between 532 nm and 633 nm, commonly referred to as the \"green gap\", are especially challenging to produce with conventional laser gain. Hence, there is motivation to extend the Kerr OPO wavelength range and develop reliable device designs. Here, we experimentally show how to robustly access the entire green gap with Kerr OPO in silicon nitride microrings pumped near 780 nm. Our microring geometries are optimized for green-gap emission; in particular, we introduce a dispersion engineering technique, based on partially undercutting the microring, which not only expands wavelength access but also proves robust to variations in resonator dimensions, in particular, the microring width. Using just two devices, we generate >100 wavelengths evenly distributed throughout the green gap, as predicted by our dispersion simulations. Moreover, we establish the usefulness of Kerr OPO to coherent applications by demonstrating continuous frequency tuning (>50 GHz) and narrow optical linewidths (<1 MHz). Our work represents an important step in the quest to bring nonlinear nanophotonics and its advantages to the visible spectrum. ",

At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest. ",

    "abstract": "The simulation of nanophotonic structures relies on electromagnetic solvers, which play a crucial role in understanding their behavior. However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can be numerically unstable and can lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach allows overcoming these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while preserving a high accuracy in the prediction capability of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "We analyze theoretically the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of a few electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to an extended band state of a small quantum dot (QD) using a simple model. In our model the QD is described by one or two single-particle energy levels while the trap is described by one single-particle level connected to the QD by a hopping Hamiltonian. Electron-electron Coulomb repulsion and electron-phonon interactions are included in the localized trap state. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent model has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Using values of the parameters appropriate for defects in semiconductor QDs, we find that the electronic motion is quasi-periodic in time, with oscillations around mean values that are set in timescales of typically a few tenths of picoseconds to picoseconds. We increase the number of electrons initially in the QD from one to four and find that one electron is transferred to the trap state for three electrons in the QD. At the more efficient values of the electron-phonon coupling, these characteristics are quite independent of the value of the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion in the trap, up to the value above which its infinite limit is reached. We conclude that strong electron-phonon interaction is an efficient mechanism that can provide the complete filling of a deep trap state on a sub to picoseconds timescale, faster than radiative exciton decay and Auger recombination processes. This leads to the complete suppression of the luminescence to the deep trap state and to the accumulation of electrons in the QD. ",

Accurate and scalable simulation tools for photonic integrated circuits are critical for designing neuromorphic photonic circuits. This is especially important when designing networks with recurrent connections, where the dynamics of the system may give rise to unstable and oscillatory solutions which need to be accurately modelled. These tools must simultaneously simulate the analog electronics and the multi-channel (wavelength-division-multiplexed) photonics contained in a photonic neuron to accurately predict on-chip behaviour. In this paper, we utilize a Verilog-A model of the photonic neural network to investigate the dynamics of recurrent integrated circuits. We begin by reviewing the theory of continuous-time recurrent neural networks as dynamical systems and the relation of these dynamics to important physical features of photonic neurons such as cascadability. We then present the neural dynamics of systems of one and two neurons in the simulated Verilog-A circuit, which are compared to the expected dynamics of the abstract CTRNN model. Due to the presence of parasitic circuit elements in the Verilog-A simulation, it is seen that there is a topological equivalence, but not an exact isomorphism, between the theoretical model and the simulated model. The implications of these discrepancies for the design of neuromorphic photonic circuits are discussed. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of large-scale silicon photonic recurrent neural networks. ",

    "title": "Observation of topologically protected compact edge states in  flux-dressed graphene photonic lattices",
    "abstract": "Systems with engineered flatband spectra are a postulate of high-capacity transmission links and a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity. However, their operation relies on the edge or surface modes susceptible to fluctuations and fabrication errors. While the mode robustness can be enhanced by a combination of Aharonov-Bohm caging and topological insulation, the design of the corresponding flatbands requires approaches beyond the standard $k$-vector-based methods. Here, we propose a synthetic-flux probe as a solution to this problem and a route to the realization of ultra-stable modes. We prove the concept in a laser-fabricated graphene-like ribbon photonic lattice with the band-flattening flux induced by \"P\" waveguide coupling. The topological non-triviality is witnessed by an integer Zak phase derived from the mean chiral displacement. Mode stability is evidenced by excellent mode localization and the robustness to fabrication tolerances and variations of the input phase. Our results can serve as a basis for the development of multi-flat-band materials for low-energy electronics. ",
