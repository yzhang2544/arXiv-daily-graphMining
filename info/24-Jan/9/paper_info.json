    "abstract": "This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the emergence and impact of filter bubbles in social phenomena, especially in both digital and offline environments, by applying the concepts of quantum field theory. Filter bubbles tend to occur in digital and offline environments, targeting digital natives with extremely low media literacy and information immunity. In addition, in the aftermath of stealth marketing, fake news, \"inspirational marketing,\" and other forms of stealth marketing that never exist are rampant and can lead to major social disruption and exploitation. These are the causes of various social risks, including declining information literacy and knowledge levels and academic achievement. By exploring quantum mechanical principles such as remote interaction, proximity interaction, Feynman diagrams, and loop diagrams, we aim to gain a better understanding of information dissemination and opinion formation in social contexts. Our model incorporates key parameters such as agents' opinions, interaction probabilities, and flexibility in changing opinions, facilitating the observation of opinion distributions, cluster formation, and polarization under a variety of conditions. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically model the filter bubble phenomenon using the concepts of quantum field theory and to analyze its social consequences. This is a discussion paper and the proposed approach offers an innovative perspective for understanding social phenomena, but its interpretation and application require careful consideration. ",

    "abstract": "Non-orthogonal eigenstates are a fundamental feature of non-Hermitian systems and are accompanied by the emergence of nontrivial features. However, the platforms to explore non-Hermitian mode couplings mainly measure near-field effects, and the far-field behaviour remain mostly unexplored. Here, we study how a microcavity with non-Hermitian mode coupling exhibits eigenstate non-orthogonality by investigating the spatial field and the far-field polarization of cavity modes. The non-Hermiticity arises from asymmetric backscattering, which is controlled by integrating two scatterers of different size and location into a microdisk. We observe that the spatial field overlaps of two modes increases abruptly to its maximum value, whilst different far-field elliptical polarizations of two modes coalesce when approaching an exceptional point. We demonstrate such features experimentally by measuring the far-field polarization from the fabricated microdisks. Our work reveals the non-orthogonality in the far-field degree of freedom, and the integrability of the microdisks paves a way to integrate more non-Hermitian optical properties into nanophotonic systems.

    "abstract": "Neutrino oscillation experiments show that neutrinos have mass; however, the absolute mass scale is exceedingly difficult to measure and is currently unknown. A promising approach is to measure the energies of the electrons released during the radioactive decay of tritium. The energies of interest are within a few eV of the 18.6 keV end point, and so are mildly relativistic. By capturing the electrons in a static magnetic field and measuring the frequency of the cyclotron radiation emitted the initial energy can be determined, but end-point events are infrequent, the observing times short, and the signal to noise ratios low. To achieve a resolution of $<$ 10 meV, single-electron emission spectra need to be recorded over large fields of view with highly sensitive receivers. The principles of Cylotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) have already been demonstrated by Project 8, and now there is considerable interest in increasing the FoV to $>$ 0.1 m$^3$. We consider a range of issues relating to the design and optimisation of inward-looking quantum-noise-limited microwave receivers for single-electron CRES, and present a single framework for understanding signal, noise and system-level behaviour. Whilst there is a great deal of literature relating to the design of outward-looking phased arrays for applications such as radar and telecommunications, there is very little coverage of the new issues that come into play when designing ultra-sensitive inward-looking phased arrays for volumetric spectroscopy and imaging.

    "abstract": "Direct-write multi-photon laser lithography (MPL) combines highest resolution on the nanoscale with essentially unlimited 3D design freedom. Over the previous years, the groundbreaking potential of this technique has been demonstrated in various application fields, including micromechanics, material sciences, microfluidics, life sciences as well as photonics, where in-situ printed optical coupling elements offer new perspectives for package-level system integration. However, millimeter-wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) devices could not yet leverage the unique strengths of MPL, even though the underlying devices and structures could also greatly benefit from 3D freeform microfabrication. One of the key challenges in this context is the fact that functional mmW and THz structures require materials with high electrical conductivity and low dielectric losses, which are not amenable to structuring by multi-photon polymerization. In this work, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach that allows to leverage MPL for fabricating high-performance mmW and THz structures with hitherto unachieved functionalities. Our concept exploits in-situ printed polymer templates that are selectively coated through highly directive metal deposition techniques in combination with precisely aligned 3D-printed shadowing structures. The resulting metal-coated freeform structures offer high surface quality in combination with low dielectric losses and conductivities comparable to bulk material values, while lending themselves to fabrication on planar mmW/THz circuits. We experimentally show the viability of our concept by demonstrating a series of functional THz structures such as THz interconnects, probe tips, and suspended antennas. We believe that our approach offers disruptive potential in the field of mmW and THz technology and may unlock an entirely new realm of laser-based 3D manufacturing. ",

    "abstract": "The optical manipulation of nanoparticles on superlubricity surfaces is investigated. The research revealed that, due to the near-zero static friction and extremely low dynamic friction at superlubricity interfaces, the maximum intensity for controlling the optical field can be less than 100 W/cm$^2$, which is nine orders of magnitude lower than controlling nanoparticles on traditional interfaces. The controlled nanoparticle radius can be as small as 5 nm, which is more than one order of magnitude smaller than nanoparticles controlled through traditional optical manipulation. Manipulation can be achieved in sub-microsecond to microsecond timescales. Furthermore, the manipulation takes place on solid surfaces and in non-liquid environments, with minimal impact from Brownian motion. By appropriately increasing dynamic friction, controlling light intensity, or reducing pressure, the effects of Brownian motion can be eliminated, allowing for the construction of microstructures with a size as small as 1/75 of the wavelength of light. This enables the control of super-resolution optical microstructures. The optical super-resolution manipulation of nanoparticles on superlubricity surfaces will find important applications in fields such as nanofabrication, photolithography, optical metasurface, and biochemical analysis.

    "abstract": "Experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling between molecular vibrations and light modes can significantly change molecular properties, such as ground-state reactivity. Theoretical studies towards the origin of this exciting observation can roughly be divided in two categories, with studies based on Hamiltonians that simply couple a molecule to a cavity mode via its ground-state dipole moment on the one hand, and on the other hand ab initio calculations that self-consistently include the effect of the cavity mode on the electronic ground state within the cavity Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) approximation; these approaches are not equivalent. The CBO approach is more rigorous, but unfortunately it requires the rewriting of electronic-structure code, and gives little physical insight. In this work, we exploit the relation between the two approaches and demonstrate on a real molecule (hydrogen fluoride) that for realistic coupling strengths, we can recover CBO energies and spectra to high accuracy using only out-of-cavity quantities from standard electronic-structure calculations. In doing so, we discover what the physical effects underlying the CBO results are. Our methodology can aid in incorporating more, possibly important features in models, play a pivotal role in demystifying CBO results and provide a practical and efficient alternative to full CBO calculations.

However, in the visible wavelengths, it's intrinsic optical switching is quite low. Current research explores solutions like multilayering, intricate structural patterning, high thermal budget processes and costly metals for improved color switching. Nonetheless, the color gamut coverage with these methodologies remains notably limited. This work overcomes these limitations and demonstrates dynamic multi-colour switching covering a large color gamut using a simple, unpatterned, ultrathin ($\\sim$ $\\frac{\\lambda}{14}$, where wavelength $\\lambda$ is taken as 575 nm at the center of visible spectrum) asymmetric Fabry-P\\'{e}rot structure of $VO_{2}$ on Aluminium (Al).

With varying oxidation durations, different colors of the oxidized samples are observed. Consistent and reversible color-switching is observed visibly and in reflectance measurements with the change in temperature from low (RT $\\sim$ 30$^{\\circ}$C) to high (HT $\\sim$ 100$^{\\circ}$C) or vice versa due to the phase transition property of the $VO_{2}$ layer in the structure.

On the other hand, the mass variation in isotopes of the constituent atoms has a profound effect on DEA. In quantum coherence observed in DEA, the isotope effect depicts itself in terms of change in the phase and the amplitude of the interfering dissociation paths. Here, we report the quantum coherence observed in DEA to HD, an isotopologue of H$_2$.

    "abstract": "A pristine suspended carbon nanotube is a near ideal environment to host long-lived quantum states. For this reason, they have been used as the core element of qubits and to explore numerous condensed matter physics phenomena. One of the most advanced technique to realize complex carbon nanotube based quantum circuits relies on a mechanical integration of the nanotube into the circuit. Despite the high-quality and complexity of the fabricated circuits, the range of possible experiments was limited to the closed quantum dot regime. Here, by engineering a transparent metal-nanotube interface, we developed a technique that overcomes this limitation. We reliably reach the open quantum dot regime as demonstrated by measurements of Fabry-Perot interferences and Kondo physics in multiple devices. A circuit-nanotube alignment precision of +/-200nm is demonstrated. Our technique allows to envision experiments requiring the combination of complex circuits and strongly coupled carbon nanotubes such as the realization of carbon nanotube superconducting qubits or flux-mediated optomechanics experiments.

We describe how it may also act as a finite-degree-of-freedom approximation to the classical three-wave interaction in certain circumstances. By promoting the field variables to operators, we quantize the classical system, show that the quantum system has more free parameters than the classical system, and explain how these parameters may be selected to optimize either initial or long-term correspondence. We then numerically compare the long-time quantum/classical correspondence far from the fixed point dynamics. We discuss the Poincare recurrence of the system and the mitigation of quantum scrambling. ",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have widespread applications in fifth-generation (5G) microwave communication. Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts. However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs. The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses. In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug discovery.

    "abstract": "Mixtures of gas and dust are pervasive in the universe, from AGN and molecular clouds to proto-planetary discs. When the two species drift relative to each other, a large class of instabilities can arise, called resonant drag instabilities (RDIs). The most famous RDI is the streaming instability, which plays an important role in planet formation. On the other hand, acoustic RDIs, the simplest kind, feature in the winds of cool stars, AGN, or starburst regions. Unfortunately, owing to the complicated dynamics of two coupled fluids (gas and dust), the underlying physics of most RDIs is mysterious. In this paper, we develop a clear physical picture of how the acoustic RDI arises and support this explanation with transparent mathematics. We find that the acoustic RDI is built on two coupled mechanisms. In the first, the converging flows of a sound wave concentrate dust. In the second, a drifting dust clump excites sound waves. These processes feed into each other at resonance, thereby closing an unstable feedback loop. This physical picture helps decide where and when RDIs are most likely to happen, and what can suppress them. Additionally, we find that the acoustic RDI remains strong far from resonance. This second result suggests that one can simulate RDIs without having to fine-tune the dimensions of the numerical domain. ",

In this work, we demonstrated the optical spin Hall effect (OSHE) and its symmetry switching in the exciton-polariton regime of pure DPAVBi crystals. Benefiting from the photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in organic crystals, we observed the separation of left- and right-circularly-polarized polariton emission in two-dimensional momentum space and real space, a signature of the OSHE. Above the lasing threshold, the OSHE pattern changes due to transverse quantization in the microbelt. This device without superlattice structure has great potential applications in topological polaritonics, such as information transmission, photonic integrated chips and quantum information. ",

    "abstract": "Frequency-selective or even frequency-tunable Terahertz (THz) photodevices are critical components for many technological applications that require nanoscale manipulation, control and confinement of light. Within this context, gate-tunable phototransistors based on plasmonic resonances are often regarded as the most promising devices for frequency-selective detection of THz fields. The exploitation of constructive interference of plasma waves in such detectors not only promises frequency selectivity, but also a pronounced sensitivity enhancement at the target frequencies. However, clear signatures of plasmon-assisted resonances in THz detectors have been only revealed at cryogenic temperatures so far, and remain unobserved at application-relevant room-temperature conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the sought-after room-temperature resonant detection of THz radiation in short-channel gated photodetectors made from high-quality single-layer graphene. The survival of this intriguing resonant regime at room-temperature ultimately relies on the weak intrinsic electron-phonon scattering in graphene, which avoids the damping of the plasma oscillations.

The hallmark topological protection of non-Abelian geometric phases reduces the need for quantum error correction on a fundamental physical level, while the inherent non-adiabaticity of the structures paves the way for unprecedented miniaturization. To demonstrate their versatility, we realize the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, experimentally show their non-Abelian nature, and combine them into a single-qubit quantum algorithm, the PQ penny flipover. The planar geometry of such designs enables them to be substituted for the conventional directional coupler meshes currently in wide-spread use in photonic quantum architectures across all platforms.

The key metrics are the generation rate and fidelity of remote Bell pairs. In this work, we propose an experimental protocol for generating remote entanglement between neutral ytterbium atom qubits using an optical cavity. By loading a large number of atoms into a single cavity, and controlling their coupling using only local light shifts, we amortize the cost of transporting and initializing atoms over many entanglement attempts, maximizing the entanglement generation rate. A twisted ring cavity geometry suppresses many sources of error, allowing high fidelity entanglement generation. We estimate a spin-photon entanglement rate of $5 \\times 10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and a Bell pair rate of $1.0\\times 10^5$ s$^{-1}$, with an average fidelity near $0.999$. Furthermore, we show that the photon detection times provide a significant amount of soft information about the location of errors, which may be used to improve the logical qubit performance. This approach provides a practical path to scalable modular quantum computing using neutral ytterbium atoms. ",

We also investigate the stochastic transformation of the classical system, where is it shown that quantum mechanics with the quantum potential reduced by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ has a classical representation, which may have interesting implications.

Very often changes in extracellular concentrations initiate signaling cascades that eventually result in changes in gene expression. Increasing stimulus strengths can be encoded in increasing concentration amplitudes or increasing activation frequencies of intermediaries of the pathway. In this Letter we show how the different way in which amplitude and frequency encoding map environmental changes impact on the cell's information transmission capabilities. While amplitude encoding is optimal for a limited range of stimuli strengths around a finite value, frequency encoding information transmission can improve or remain relatively flat as the stimulus strength increases. The apparently redundant combination of both mechanisms in some cell types may then serve the purpose of expanding the range over which stimulus strengths can be reliably discriminated. In this Letter we also discuss a possible example of this mechanism. ",

Since the quantum potential term is removed under this transformation, the equations for momentum propagation along particle trajectories assume a classical form. A local stochastic de Broglie-Bohm interpretation for the Klein-Gordon system can subsequently be derived. We also introduce the concept of momentum equivariance to replace the second-order Bohm-Newton equations of motion, which break down due to non-linear terms of the stochastic Lagrangian derivative.
