    "abstract": "Recent research has developed the Ising model from physics, especially statistical mechanics, and it plays an important role in quantum computing, especially quantum annealing and quantum Monte Carlo methods. The model has also been used in opinion dynamics as a powerful tool for simulating social interactions and opinion formation processes. Individual opinions and preferences correspond to spin states, and social pressure and communication dynamics are modeled through interactions between spins. Quantum computing makes it possible to efficiently simulate these interactions and analyze more complex social networks.Recent research has incorporated concepts from quantum information theory such as Graph State, Stabilizer State, and Surface Code (or Toric Code) into models of opinion dynamics. The incorporation of these concepts allows for a more detailed analysis of the process of opinion formation and the dynamics of social networks. The concepts lie at the intersection of graph theory and quantum theory, and the use of Graph State in opinion dynamics can represent the interdependence of opinions and networks of influence among individuals. It helps to represent the local stability of opinions and the mechanisms for correcting misunderstandings within a social network. It allows us to understand how individual opinions are subject to social pressures and cultural influences and how they change over time.Incorporating these quantum theory concepts into opinion dynamics allows for a deeper understanding of social interactions and opinion formation processes. Moreover, these concepts can provide new insights not only in the social sciences, but also in fields as diverse as political science, economics, marketing, and urban planning. ",

    "abstract": "The nature of enhanced photoemission in disordered and amorphous solids is an intriguing open question. A point in case is light emission in silicon, which occurs when the material is porous or nanostructured, but the effect is absent in the bulk crystalline phase, a phenomenon that is still not fully understood. In this work, we study structural photoemission in a heterogeneous cross-linked silicon glass, a material that represents an intermediate state between the amorphous and crystalline phases, characterized by a narrow distribution of structure sizes. This model system shows a clear dependence of photoemission on size and disorder across a broad range of energies. While phonon-assisted indirect optical transitions are insufficient to describe observable emissions, our experiments suggest these can be understood through electronic Raman scattering instead. This phenomenon, not commonly observed in crystalline semiconductors, is driven by structural disorder. We attribute photoemission in this disordered system to the presence of an excess electron density of states within the forbidden gap (Urbach bridge), where electrons occupy trapped states. Transitions from gap states to the conduction band are facilitated through electron-photon momentum matching, which resembles Compton scattering, but observed for visible light and driven by the enhanced momentum of a photon confined within the nanostructured domains. We interpret the light emission in structured silicon glass as resulting from electronic Raman scattering. These findings emphasize the role of photon momentum in the optical response of solids that display disorder at the nanoscale. ",

In the measured transient 3D map, the typical third-order nonlinear optical signals of two-beam coupling (TBC) and two-photon absorption (TPA) can be clearly found out, which both exhibit the pronounced orientation-dependent periodic modulation corresponding to a specific lattice symmetry. Interestingly, the further fixed-delay-time measurements focusing on TBC and TPA confirm that the modulation amplitude of the orientation-dependent curves always increases with the increase of pump intensity towards the damage threshold, which has not been observed in previous studies. Such a definite upward trend of orientation-dependent third-order nonlinear optical effects in the near-damage-threshold regime indicate that, as long as the laser-matter interaction length is small enough, the third-order nonlinear optical phenomena can still be in a non-saturation physical regime till the damage threshold, and thus exhibit significant crystallographic dependence as that of laser-induced damage at the similar intensity ranges.

The up conversion can extend solid state laser sources to the ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet (DUV) ranges through harmonic generation and for down conversion needed for quantum information technology, but only a few suitable materials are known as the medium because of the combination of properties that are required. These include suitable band gaps, moderate optical anisotropy for phase matching and strong nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Fluorooxoborates are a new ideal platform for this effect in DUV. Here we demonstrate that fluorooxoborate is the optimal framework for DUV NLO material and show that the significance of the incorporation of fluorine in borates. The NLO performance of fluorooxoborates is strongly improved in terms of local crystal structure and distribution of electronic states. Importantly, the role of fluorine is to control the structure, while maintaining high band gaps but does not directly provide large contributions to birefringence and the second harmonic generation as the conventional assumptions. This is a consequence of the microscopic electron distribution and the energy position of the fluorine states well below the valence band maxima. Based on our understandings, we constructed two artificial structure and they all behave as anticipated. ",

With quantum teleportation likely to play a key role in several communication technologies and the quantum internet in the future, it is imperative to create learning tools and approaches that can accurately and effectively communicate the concept. Recent research has indicated the importance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics. Therefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to find engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting topics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm to teach about the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas gift-bringer Santa Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual context to explore the key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without being overly abstract. In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom setting which is based on common misconceptions from quantum physics. ",

The obtained results reveal that the Ca(InP)2 compound exhibits a direct band gap of 0 eV and 0,645 eV for PBE-GGA and GGA+mBJ, respectively.

Thermodynamic properties, including heat capacity and Debye temperature, are also calculated, providing a deeper understanding of the compound's thermal behavior.

    "abstract": "Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors are a competitive choice for future X-ray astronomy missions. Typically, CMOS sensors on space astronomical telescopes are exposed to a high dose of irradiation. We investigate the impact of irradiation on the performance of two scientific CMOS (sCMOS) sensors between -30 to 20 degree at high gain mode (7.5 times), including the bias map, readout noise, dark current, conversion gain, and energy resolution. The two sensors are irradiated with 50 MeV protons with a total dose of 5.3*10^10 p/cm^2. After the exposure, the bias map, readout noise and conversion gain at various temperatures are not significantly degraded, nor is the energy resolution at -30 degree. However, after the exposure the dark current has increased by hundreds of times, and for every 20 degree increase in temperature, the dark current also increases by an order of magnitude. Therefore, at room temperature, the fluctuations of the dark currents dominate the noise and lead to a serious degradation of the energy resolution. Moreover, among the 4k * 4k pixels, there are about 100 pixels whose bias at 50 ms has changed by more than 10 DN (~18 e-), and about 10 pixels whose readout noise has increased by over 15 e- at -30 degree. Fortunately, the influence of the dark current can be reduced by decreasing the integration time, and the degraded pixels can be masked by regular analysis of the dark images. Some future X-ray missions will likely operate at -30 degree, under which the dark current is too small to significantly affect the X-ray performance. Our investigations show the high tolerance of the sCMOS sensors for proton radiation and prove their suitability for X-ray astronomy applications. ",

    "abstract": "We formulate and implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver Self Consistent Field (VQE-SCF) algorithm in combination with polarizable embedding (PE), thereby extending PE to the regime of quantum computing. We test the resulting algorithm, PE-VQE-SCF, on quantum simulators and demonstrate that the computational stress on the quantum device is only slightly increased in terms of gate counts compared to regular VQE-SCF. On the other hand, no increase in shot noise was observed. We illustrate how PE-VQE-SCF may lead to the modeling of real chemical systems using a simulation of the reaction barrier of the Diels-Alder reaction between furan and ethene as an example. ",

    "title": "Directional spontaneous emission in photonic crystal slabs",
    "abstract": "Spontaneous emission is one of the most fundamental out-of-equilibrium processes in which an excited quantum emitter relaxes to the ground state due to quantum fluctuations. In this process, a photon is emitted that can interact with other nearby emitters and establish quantum correlations between them, e.g., via super and subradiance effects. One way to modify these photon-mediated interactions is to alter the dipole radiation patterns of the emitter, e.g., by placing photonic crystals near them. One recent example is the generation of strong directional emission patterns-key to enhancing super and subradiance effects-in two dimensions by employing photonic crystals with band structures characterized by linear isofrequency contours and saddle-points. However, these studies have predominantly used oversimplified toy models, overlooking the electromagnetic field's intricacies in actual materials, including aspects like geometrical dependencies, emitter positions, and polarization. Our study delves into the interaction between these directional emission patterns and the aforementioned variables, revealing the untapped potential to fine-tune collective quantum optical phenomena.

    "abstract": "We investigate the Autler-Townes splitting for Rydberg atoms dressed with linearly polarized microwave radiation, resonant with generic $S_{1/2}\\leftrightarrow{P}_{1/2}$ and $S_{1/2}\\leftrightarrow{P}_{3/2}$ transitions. The splitting is probed using laser light via electromagnetically-induced transparency measurements, where transmission of probe laser light reveals a two-peak pattern. In particular, this pattern is invariant under rotation of the microwave field polarization. In consequence, we establish $S \\leftrightarrow P$ Rydberg transitions as ideally suited for polarization-insensitive electrometry, contrary to recent findings [A. Chopinaud and J.D. Pritchard, Phys. Rev. Appl. $\\mathbf{16}$, 024008 (2021)]. ",
