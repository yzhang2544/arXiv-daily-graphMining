A novel dual-cantilever tuning fork structure and new electrodes have been designed using Y-cut 128{\\deg} blackened lithium niobate wafers.

In the demonstration experiment, acetylene was detected using a 1.53 um semiconductor laser, achieving a detection limit of about 9 ppb within a one-second integration time. ",

    "abstract": "The concept of Chern number has been widely used to describe the topological properties of periodic condensed matter and classical wave systems. It is typically defined in the momentum space and is closely related to the geometric phase of dispersion bands. Here, we introduce a new type of spin Chern number defined in the real space for optical near fields of finite-sized structures. This real-space spin Chern number is derived from the geometric phase of the near fields and exhibits an intrinsic relationship with the topology of the optical structures: the spin Chern number of optical near fields is quantized and equal to the Euler characteristic of the optical structures. This relationship is robust under continuous deformation of the structure's geometry and is independent of the specific material constituents or external excitation. Our work enriches topological physics by extending the concept of Chern number from the momentum space to the real space and opens exciting possibilities for manipulating light based on the topology of optical structures, with potential applications in high-precision optical metrology, optical sensing and imaging.

The compression of a gas in this cavity leads to a strong squeeze film force, resulting in an increase in the membrane mechanical resonance frequencies which is directly proportional to the absolute gas pressure. These sandwiches show a record high responsitivity of >300 Hz/Pa in terms of squeeze film-induced frequency shift, which, combined with high quality factor mechanical resonances (Q>10^6), allows for bringing the sensitivity of absolute squeeze film pressure sensors down to the sub-millipascal level.

    "abstract": "Most properties of acoustic structures derive from their material and geometry. Few are explicitly related to the real-space topology of the structures. Here, we discover a fundamental connection between the real-space topology of acoustic structures and the topological properties of acoustic fields. We find that the genus of acoustic cavities can protect the birth of acoustic polarization singularities and give rise to chiral velocity fields with nonzero spin density. These polarization singularities are characterized by an integer or half-integer topological index. For a cavity with smooth and hard boundaries, the total index of the surface singularities must be equal to the Euler characteristic of the cavity and is decided solely by the number of \"holes\" in the cavity surface, guaranteed by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. This intriguing property is irrelevant to the specific material, geometric details, or excitation properties. Besides, the polarization singularities can give rise to nontrivial polarization Mobius strips and skyrmion textures of velocity field with rich spatial and temporal properties. The study uncovers the intrinsic effects of real-space topology on acoustic field properties and enables sound manipulation via a new degree of freedom, i.e., structural topology. The results can find applications in chiral sound-matter interactions and acoustic manipulation of small particles. ",

    "abstract": "We provide a theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation of the Kerr nonlinearity impact on the performance of a frequency-multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In such ELM, the neuron signals are encoded in the lines of a frequency comb. The Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the randomized neuron connections allowing for efficient information mixing. A programmable spectral filter applies the output weights. The system operates in a continuous-wave regime. Even at low input peak powers, the resulting weak Kerr nonlinearity is sufficient to significantly boost the performance on several tasks. This boost already arises when one uses only the very small Kerr nonlinearity present in a 20-meter long erbium-doped fiber amplifier. In contrast, a subsequent propagation in 540 meters of a single-mode fiber improves the performance only slightly, whereas additional information mixing with a phase modulator does not result in a further improvement at all. We introduce a model to show that, in frequency-multiplexed ELMs, the Kerr nonlinearity mixes information via four-wave mixing, rather than via self- or cross-phase modulation. At low powers, this effect is quartic in the comb-line amplitudes. Numerical simulations validate our experimental results and interpretation. ",

    "abstract": "Easily accessible through tabletop experiments based on laser propagation inside nonlinear optical media, Paraxial Fluids of Light are emerging as promising platforms for the simulation and exploration of quantum-like phenomena. In particular, the analogy builds on a formal equivalence between the governing model for a Bose-Einstein Condensate under the mean-field approximation and the model of laser propagation under the paraxial approximation. Yet, the fact that the role of time is played by the propagation distance in the optical analogue system may impose strong bounds on the range of accessible phenomena due to the limited length of the nonlinear medium. In this manuscript, we present a novel experimental approach to solve this limitation in the form of an optical feedback loop, which consists of the reconstruction of the optical states at the end of the system followed by their subsequent re-injection exploiting wavefront shaping techniques. The results enclosed demonstrate the potential of this approach to access unprecedented dynamics, paving for the observation of novel phenomena in these systems. ",

The experimental results show that, after initial transients, the drop spreads with approximately constant speed while leaving a thin layer of fluid behind. To better understand the system, we develop a theoretical model that couples acoustic driving with the fluid mechanics of a spreading drop. An important feature of the problem is that the strength of the acoustic driving depends on the fluid thickness, with strong attenuation of the forcing in regions of the domain covered by fluid. The presented model provides results consistent with the experiments, particularly regarding drop height and spreading speed. The constant spreading speed observed in the experiments is also captured by an approximate traveling-wave solution, which provides predictions for the dependence of drop thickness and spreading speed on the acoustic amplitude.

    "abstract": "A new generation of phenomenological optical potentials requires robust calibration and uncertainty quantification, motivating the use of Bayesian statistical methods. These Bayesian methods usually require calculating observables for thousands or even millions of parameter sets, making fast and accurate emulators highly desirable or even essential. Emulating scattering across different energies or with interactions such as optical potentials is challenging because of the non-affine parameter dependence, meaning the parameters do not all factorize from individual operators. Here we introduce and demonstrate the Reduced Order Scattering Emulator (ROSE) framework, a reduced basis emulator that can handle non-affine problems. ROSE is fully extensible and works within the publicly available BAND Framework software suite for calibration, model mixing, and experimental design. As a demonstration problem, we use ROSE to calibrate a realistic nucleon-target scattering model through the calculation of elastic cross sections. This problem shows the practical value of the ROSE framework for Bayesian uncertainty quantification with controlled trade-offs between emulator speed and accuracy as compared to high-fidelity solvers. Planned extensions of ROSE are discussed. ",

Various quantum transport and interaction phenomena have been found to be critically influenced by quantum geometry. For example, quantum geometry allows counterintuitive flow of supercurrent in a flat band where single electrons are immobile. In this Essay, I will discuss my view of the important open problems and future applications of this research topic and will try to inspire the reader to come up with further ideas. At its best, quantum geometry can open a new chapter in band theory and lead to breakthroughs as transformative as room-temperature superconductivity. However, first, more experiments directly showing the effect of quantum geometry are needed. We also have to integrate quantum geometry analysis in our most advanced numerical methods. Further, the ramifications of quantum geometry should be studied in a wider range, including electric and electromagnetic responses and interaction phenomena in free- and correlated-electron materials, bosonic systems, optics, and other fields.

In this study, we demonstrate the methodology for generating stationary entanglement between two-level atoms and magnons, which are implemented using two optical cavities inside the setup. Additionally, we investigate the efficiency of transforming entanglement from atom-phonon entanglement to atom-magnon entanglement. The magnons are stimulated by both a bias magnetic field and a microwave magnetic field, and they interact with phonons through the mechanism of magnetostrictive interaction. This interaction generates magnomechanical displacement, which couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We demonstrate that by carefully selecting the frequency detuning of an optical cavity, it is possible to achieve an increase in bipartite entanglements. Furthermore, this improvement is found to be resistant to changes in temperature. The entanglement between atoms and magnons plays a crucial role in the construction of hybrid quantum networks. Our modeling approach exhibits potential applications in the field of magneto-optical trap systems as well. ",

    "abstract": "N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) iridium (III) complexes are considered as promising candidates for blue emitters in organic light-emitting diodes. They can play the roles of the emitter as well as of electron and hole transporters in the same emission layer. We investigate optical transitions in such complexes with account of geometry and electronic structure changes upon excitation or charging and exciton transfer between the complexes from first principles. It is shown that excitation of NHC iridium complexes is accompanied by a large reorganization energy $\\sim$0.7 eV and a significant loss in the oscillator strength, which should lead to low exciton diffusion. Calculations with account of spin-orbit coupling reveal a small singlet-triplet splitting $\\sim$0.1 eV, whereas the oscillator strength for triplet excitations is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than for the singlet ones. The contributions of the F\\\"orster and Dexter mechanisms are analyzed via the explicit integration of transition densities. It is shown that for typical distances between emitter complexes in the emission layer, the contribution of the Dexter mechanism should be negligible compared to the F\\\"orster mechanism. On the other hand, the ideal dipole approximation, although gives the correct order of the exciton coupling, fails to reproduce the result taking into account spatial distribution of the transition density. For charged NHC complexes, we find a number of optical transitions close to the emission peak of the blue emitter with high exciton transfer rates that can be responsible for exciton-polaron quenching. The nature of these transitions is analyzed. ",

However, the accuracy of the molecular properties predicted by most of the quantum computations nowadays is still far off (not within chemical accuracy) compared to their corresponding experimental data. Here, we propose a promising qubit-efficient quantum computational approach to calculate the harmonic vibrational frequencies of a large set of neutral closed-shell diatomic molecules with results in great agreement with their experimental data. To this end, we construct the accurate Hamiltonian using molecular orbitals, derived from density functional theory to account for the electron correlation and expanded in the Daubechies wavelet basis set to allow an accurate representation in real space grid points, where an optimized compact active space is further selected so that only a reduced small number of qubits is sufficient to yield an accurate result. To justify the approach, we benchmark the performance of the Hamiltonians spanned by the selected molecular orbitals by first transforming the molecular Hamiltonians into qubit Hamiltonians and then using the exact diagonalization method to calculate the results, regarded as the best results achievable by quantum computation. Furthermore, we show that the variational quantum circuit with the chemistry-inspired UCCSD ansatz can achieve the same accuracy as the exact diagonalization method except for systems whose Mayer bond order indices are larger than 2. For those systems, we demonstrate that the heuristic hardware-efficient RealAmplitudes ansatz, even with a shorter circuit depth, can provide a significant improvement over the UCCSD ansatz, verifying that the harmonic vibrational frequencies could be calculated accurately by quantum computation in the NISQ era.
