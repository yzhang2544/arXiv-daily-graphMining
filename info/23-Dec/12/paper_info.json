    "abstract": "Low phase noise microwave oscillators are at the center of a multitude of applications that span the gamut of photonics and electronics. Within this space, optically-derived approaches to microwave frequency synthesis are particularly compelling owing to their unique combination of ultrawideband frequency access and the potential for resiliency to temperature and environmental perturbation via common-mode noise rejection. We demonstrate here an optical frequency divider that uses the 30 terahertz frequency gap between two stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers as the basis for frequency division. The resulting microwave signal, centered at 10 GHz frequency, exhibits exceptionally low phase noise levels of -95 dBc/Hz and -110 dBc/Hz at 10 Hz and 100 Hz frequency offset, respectively. Moreover, the two SBS lasers, generated from a common fiber resonator, exhibits a high degree of correlated noise cancellation in their frequency difference. We measure 16.1 dB of noise rejection against intentionally applied vibrations, thus showcasing a promising pathway towards portable and robust ultralow noise photonic-microwave synthesis. ",

    "title": "Enhancing the Electron Pair Approximation with Measurements on Trapped  Ion Quantum Computers",
    "abstract": "The electron pair approximation offers a resource efficient variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for quantum chemistry simulations on quantum computers. With the number of entangling gates scaling quadratically with system size and a constant energy measurement overhead, the orbital optimized unitary pair coupled cluster double (oo-upCCD) ansatz strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency on today's quantum computers. However, the electron pair approximation makes the method incapable of producing quantitatively accurate energy predictions. In order to improve the accuracy without increasing the circuit depth, we explore the idea of reduced density matrix (RDM) based second order perturbation theory (PT2) as an energetic correction to electron pair approximation. The new approach takes into account of the broken-pair energy contribution that is missing in pair-correlated electron simulations, while maintaining the computational advantages of oo-upCCD ansatz. In dissociations of N$_2$, Li$_2$O, and chemical reactions such as the unimolecular decomposition of CH$_2$OH$^+$ and the \\snTwo reaction of CH$_3$I $+$ Br$^-$, the method significantly improves the accuracy of energy prediction. On two generations of the IonQ's trapped ion quantum computers, Aria and Forte, we find that unlike the VQE energy, the PT2 energy correction is highly noise-resilient. By applying a simple error mitigation approach based on post-selection solely on the VQE energies, the predicted VQE-PT2 energy differences between reactants, transition state, and products are in excellent agreement with noise-free simulators.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of shock induced ignition and transition to detonation in a reactive medium in the presence of mechanically induced fluctuations by a moving oscillating piston. For the inert problem prior to ignition, we provide a closed form model for the generation of the train of compression and expansions, their steepening into a train of N-shock waves and their reflection on the lead shock, as well as the distribution energy dissipation rate in the induction zone. The model is found in excellent agreement with numerics. Reactive calculations were performed for hydrogen and ethylene fuels using a novel high-fidelity numerical Lagrangian scheme. Different regimes of ignition and transition to detonation, controlled by the time scale of the forcing and the two time scales of the chemistry: the induction and reaction times. Two novel hot spot cascade mechanisms were identified. The first relies on the coherence between the sequence of hot spot formation set by the piston forcing and forward wave interaction with the lead shock, generalizing the classic runaway in fast flames. The second hot spot cascade is triggered by the feedback between the pressure pulse generated by the first generation hot spot cascade and the shock. For slow forcing, the sensitization is through a modification to the classic run-away process, while the high frequency regime leads to very localized sub-critical hot-spot formation controlled by the cumulative energy dissipation of the first generation shocks at a distance comparable to the shock formation location.

However, classical radiation reaction (RR) effects has not been investigated as an accelerated electron emits vortex radiation during the interaction with a laser. This work focuses on investigating the effects of radiation reaction on the production of twisted photons in the Nonlinear Inverse Thomson Scattering (NITS) process. Using the precise electron trajectory obtained by Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation with a circularly polarized (CP) laser, we find that the radiation reaction effects can be significant for a sufficiently long pulse of a laser. They observe modifications in the frequency, phase structure, rotational asymmetry of OAM density, and energy distribution of the vortex field due to radiation reaction. This finding could provide an unique signature for the detection of radiation reaction. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a complex investigation for miniaturizing of perovskite photodiodes (PPDs) in various geometries with use of ultraviolet laser scribing (UV-LS). Employing a 355 nm (3.5 eV) pulsed laser at 30 kHz, we successfully manufactured PPDs with pixel configurations of 70x130 um2, 520x580 um2, and 2000x2000 um2. The utilization of UV-LS has a proven efficiency in achieving relevant diode characteristics, such as low dark currents and high shunt resistance, as well as ultrafast response. The multi-step scribing cycle provided precise patterning of perovskite photodiodes (PPDs) in a string design. The dark current densities demonstrated exceptional uniformity, ranging from 10-10 A/cm2 for 2000x2000 um2 pixelated PPDs to 10-9 A/cm2 for the 70x130 um2 configuration. The string PPDs, consisting of 10 pixels per string, displayed homogenous dark current values, ensuring effective isolation between devices. Under green light illumination (540 nm), all PPD types exhibited a broad Linear Dynamic Range (LDR). Specifically, LDR values reached 110 dB, 117 dB, and 136 dB for 70x130, 520x580, and 2000x2000 devices, respectively, spanning an illumination intensity range from 2*10-3 mW/cm2 to 2 mW/cm2. High responsivity values up to 0.38 A/W, depending on the PPDs geometry, highlight the potential of laser scribing devices for sensing in the visible range. The calculated specific detectivity performance (from 1011 to 1013 Jones) surpasses commercial analogs, while the sub-microsecond response of 70x130 um2 and 520x580 um2 miniaturized devices underscores their suitability for precise time resolution detection systems.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) provides access to fast and accurate quantum chemistry (QC) calculations for various properties of interest such as excitation energies. It is often the case that high accuracy in prediction using an ML model, demands a large and costly training set. Various solutions and procedures have been presented to reduce this cost. These include methods such as $\\Delta$-ML, hierarchical-ML, and multifidelity machine learning (MFML). MFML combines various $\\Delta$-ML like sub-models for various fidelities according to a fixed scheme derived from the sparse grid combination technique. In this work we implement an optimization procedure to combine multifidelity models in a flexible scheme resulting in optimized MFML (o-MFML) that provides superior prediction capabilities. This hyper-parameter optimization is carried out on a holdout validation set of the property of interest. This work benchmarks the o-MFML method in predicting the atomization energies on the QM7b dataset, and again in the prediction of excitation energies for three molecules of growing size. The results indicate that o-MFML is a strong methodological improvement over MFML and provides lower error of prediction. Even in cases of poor data distributions and lack of clear hierarchies among the fidelities, which were previously identified as issues for multifidelity methods, the o-MFML provides advantage to the prediction of quantum chemical properties.

    "abstract": "In a joint effort, MeteoSwiss and Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) address the need for improving the initial state of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) by exploiting ground-based profiling observations that aim to fill the existing observational gap in the ABL. We implemented the brightness temperature observations from ground-based microwave radiometers (MWRs) into our data assimilation systems using a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) with RTTOV-gb (Radiative Transfer for TOVS, ground-based) as a forward operator. We were able to obtain a positive impact on the brightness temperature first guess and analysis as well as a slight impact on the ABL humidity using two MWRs at MeteoSwiss. These results led to a subsequent operational implementation of the observing system at MeteoSwiss. Furthermore, we performed an extensive set of assimilation experiments at DWD to further investigate various aspects such as the vertical localisation of selected single channels. We obtained a positive impact on the 6h-forecast of ABL temperature and humidity by assimilating two channels employing a dynamical localisation based on the sensitivity functions of RTTOV-gb but also with a static localisation in a single-channel setup. Our experiments indicate the importance of the vertical localisation when using more than one channel, although reliable improvements are challenging to obtain without a larger number of observations for both assimilation and verification.

Several features of the transmission spectrum are analyzed, including velocity-dependent frequency rescaling, the Fabry-Perot transmittance, and the transmission phase near resonance. Special attentions are given to the non-relativistic regime, where application prospects are evaluated. Potential new interferometric schemes, such as velocity-scanning interferometry and hybrid interferometers based on nested configurations, are proposed.

    "abstract": "Direct laser acceleration of electrons is an important energy deposition mechanism for laser-irradiated plasmas that is particularly effective at relativistic laser intensities in the presence of quasi-static laser-driven plasma electric and magnetic fields. These radial electric and azimuthal magnetic fields provide transverse electron confinement by inducing betatron oscillations of forward-moving electrons undergoing laser acceleration. Electrons are said to experience a betatron resonance when the frequency of betatron oscillations matches the average frequency of the laser field oscillations at the electron position. In this paper, we show that the modulation of the laser frequency caused by the betatron oscillation can be another important mechanism for net energy gain that is qualitatively different from the betatron resonance. Specifically, we show that the frequency modulation experienced by the electron can lead to net energy gain in the regime where the laser field performs three oscillations per betatron oscillation. There is no net energy gain in this regime without the modulation because the energy gain is fully compensated by the energy loss. The modulation slows down the laser oscillation near transverse stopping points, increasing the time interval during which the electron gains energy and making it possible to achieve net energy gain.

    "abstract": "Hydrogenated amorphous silicon is well known for its various alloys and wide ranging opto-electronic properties. Hydrogenated silicon sub-oxide (aSiO:H) is one of them. The effect of boron doping on optoelectronic properties of the aSiO:H have been investigated with intrinsic and delta-doped materials. The Urbach energy of the tail and midgap defect states of the intrinsic and lightly doped(0.01% gas phase doping) materials were found to be 103, 151 meV and 8.19x1016 , 5.47x1017 cm-3 respectively. As a result of the 0.01% doping a reduction in optical gap was observed from 1.99 to 1.967 eV along with a shift in Fermi level by 0.258eV, indicating an efficient boron doping of the intrinsic silicon oxide material. The lightly doped p-type layer was used to simulate device characteristics in amorphous silicon (aSi:H) and HIT-type solar cell. In the aSi:H device the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was moderate while in a HIT-type device the PCE was 26.4%. It indicated that a good quality silicon oxide layer can be an attractive passivation layer for a HIT type device. It further indicated that defect density of the passivation layer can have a significant impact on performance of a HIT type device. The primary difference of the two passivation layers (intrinsic and delta-doped) are the difference in mid-gap and tail states. Passivation layer with a higher mid-gap state leads to poorer device performance. Therefore, it highlights the importance of using a less defective passivation layer to improve device performance. ",

Compared with their orthogonal polarization states, the optical profiles of various modes of the same polarization are similar, and their directions of the main electric field are same. Therefore, it's much easier to design PID devices using multi-modes of one polarization state instead of orthogonal polarizations. This paper firstly presents a scalable method to achieve PID devices and systems by transforming the light orthogonal polarization states into one polarization with different modes. Taking thermo-optical switches as an example, the PDL of the fabricated 2 x 2 switch cell was about 0.8 dB at 1300-1360 nm, and its extinction ratio (ER) was larger than 19 dB for both polarizations. A 4 x 4 switch was also demonstrated and its function of dual polarization switching was implemented, whose ER was larger than 11 dB for both polarizations. This method has potential in constructing PID on-chip systems for optical communications, optical interconnections, etc. ",

    "title": "Non-iterative Methods in Inhomogeneous Background Inverse Scattering  Imaging Problem Assisted by Swin Transformer Network",
    "abstract": "A deep learning-assisted inversion method is proposed to solve the inhomogeneous background imaging problem. Three non-iterative methods, namely the distorted-Born (DB) major current coefficients method, the DB modified Born approximation method, and the DB connection method, are introduced to address the inhomogeneous background inverse scattering problem. These methods retain the multiple scattering information by utilizing the major current obtained through singular value decomposition of the Green's function and the scattered field, without resourcing to optimization techniques. As a result, the proposed methods offer improved reconstruction resolution and accuracy for unknown objects embedded in inhomogeneous backgrounds, surpassing the backpropagation scheme (BPS) and Born approximation (BA) method that disregard the multiple scattering effect. To further enhance the resolution and accuracy of the reconstruction, a Shifted-Window (Swin) transformer network is employed for capturing super-resolution information in the images. The attention mechanism incorporated in the shifted window facilitates global interactions between objects, thereby enhancing the performance of the inhomogeneous background imaging algorithm while reducing computational complexity. Moreover, an adaptive training method is proposed to enhance the generalization ability of the network. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through both synthetic data and experimental data. Notably, super-resolution imaging is achieved with quasi real-time speed, indicating promising application potential for the proposed algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous mechanical dyskinesis during acute myocardial ischaemia is thought to contribute to arrhythmogenic alterations to cardiac electrophysiology. Various forms of mechano-electric coupling (MEC) mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to these changes, with two primary mechanisms being: (1) myofilament-dependent calcium release events, and (2) the activation of stretch-activated currents (SACs). In this computational investigation, we assessed the collective impact of these processes on mechanically-induced alternans that create an arrhythmogenic substrate during acute ischaemia. To appraise the potential involvement of MEC in ischaemia-induced arrhythmias, we developed a coupled model of ventricular myocyte electrophysiology and contraction including SACs and stretch-dependent calcium buffering and release. The model, reflecting observed electrophysiological changes during ischaemia, was exposed to a series of stretch protocols that replicated both physiological and pathological mechanical conditions. Pathologically realistic myofiber stretch variations revealed calcium sensitivity changes dependent on myofilament, leading to alterations in cytosolic calcium concentrations. Under calcium overload conditions, these changes resulted in electrical alternans. The study implies that strain impacts cellular electrophysiology through myofilament calcium release and SAC opening in ventricular mechano-electrical models, parameterised to available data. This supports experimental evidence suggesting that both calcium-driven instability via MEC and SAC-induced effects contribute to electrical alternans in acute ischaemia. ",

The $E_\\text{a}$ is calculated using the Arrhenius equation corresponding to the thickness growth rate while using substrate temperature ($\\sim1000-1300$ K) in all the calculations. While the calculated values match with the $E_\\text{a}$ for nano diamond formation throughout the literature, these values of $\\sim$10 kcal/mol are lower compared to $\\sim$15 -- 25 kcal/mol for standard single crystal diamond (SCD) formation, concluding thus far, that the energetics and processes involved are different. In this work, To further investigate this, the substrate preparation and sample collection method are modified while keeping the growth parameters constant. Unseeded Si substrates are physically separated from the plasma discharge by a molybdenum plate with a pinhole drilled in it. Small quantities of a sample substance are collected on the substrates. The sample is characterized by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirming it to be nano diamond, thus, suggesting that nano diamond self nucleates in the plasma and flows to the substrate which acts as a mere collection plate. It is hypothesized then, if nano diamond nucleates in gas phase, gas temperature has to be used in the Arrhenius analysis. The $E_\\text{a}$ values for all the nano diamond films are re-calculated using the simulated gas temperature ($\\sim1500-2000$ K) obtained from a simple H$_\\text{2}$/CH$_\\text{4}$ plasma model, giving values within the range characteristic to SCD formation.

The Cassini observation exceeds the predicted $k_2$ by one order of magnitude in the absence of an ocean, and is 3-$\\sigma$ away from the predicted $k_2$ if the ocean is pure water resting on top of a rigid ocean floor. Previous studies demonstrate that an ocean heavily enriched in salts (salinity $S\\gtrsim200$ g/kg) can explain the 3-$\\sigma$ signal in $k_2$. Here we revisit previous interpretations of Titan's large $k_2$ using simple physical arguments and propose a new interpretation based on the dynamic tidal response of a stably stratified ocean in resonance with eccentricity tides raised by Saturn. Our models include inertial effects from a full consideration of the Coriolis force and the radial stratification of the ocean, typically neglected or approximated elsewhere. The stratification of the ocean emerges from a salinity profile where salt concentration linearly increases with depth. We find multiple salinity profiles that lead to the $k_2$ required by Cassini. In contrast with previous interpretations that neglect stratification, resonant stratification reduces the bulk salinity required by observations by an order of magnitude, reaching a salinity for Titan's ocean that is compatible with that of Earth's oceans and close to Enceladus' plumes. Consequently, no special process is required to enrich Titan's ocean to a high salinity as previously suggested. ",

A common workaround is statistical downscaling (aka superresolution), where a low-resolution prediction is super-resolved using statistical approaches. While traditional computer vision tasks mainly focus on human perception or mean squared error, applications in weather and climate require capturing the conditional distribution of high-resolution patterns given low-resolution patterns so that reliable ensemble averages can be taken. Our approach relies on extending recent video diffusion models to precipitation superresolution: an optical flow on the high-resolution output induces temporally coherent predictions, whereas a temporally-conditioned diffusion model generates residuals that capture the correct noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on X-SHiELD, an established large-scale climate simulation dataset, and compare against two state-of-the-art baselines, focusing on CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, as well as an illustrative case -- the complex terrain of California. Our approach sets a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling. ",

Prominently, this assumption has to be abandoned in the context of quantum mechanics, yet there are also classical processes in which measurements influence the measured system. Here, we derive conditions that characterize uniquely classical processes that are probed by a reasonable class of invasive measurements. We then analyse under what circumstances such classical processes can simulate the statistics arising from quantum processes associated with informationally-complete measurements.
