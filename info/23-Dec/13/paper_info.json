Self-focusing instability leads to beam focusing and, consequently, breakup into multiple laser filaments. The majority of applications tend to avoid the laser filamentation regime due to its detrimental role on laser spot profile and peak intensity. In our work, using nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation solver and particle-in-cell simulations, we address the problem of interaction of multiple parallel beams in plasmas. We consider both non-relativistic and moderately relativistic regimes, and demonstrate how the physics of parallel beam interaction transitions from the familiar self- and mutual-focusing instabilities in the non-relativistic regime to moderately relativistic regime, where an analytical description of filament interaction is impenetrable.

Standing acoustic waves have been previously employed for patterning preformed metal particles, however, direct patterning of metallic structures from precursors remains unexplored. Here, we investigate utilization of standing waves to exert control over chemical reaction products, while also exploring their potential in the formation of multi-layered and composite micro-structures. Periodic metallic micro-structures were formed in a single step, simplifying microstructure fabrication. Concentric structures were obtained by introducing a metal precursor salt and a reducing agent into a cylindrical piezoelectric resonator that also served as a reservoir. In addition, we introduce an innovative approach to directly fabricate metallic multi-layer and composite structures by reducing different metal ions or adding nanoparticles during the reduction step. Fewer steps are needed, compared with other methods, and there is no need to stabilize the nanoparticles or to ensure chemical affinity between the metallic matrix and inorganic nanoparticles. This innovative approach is promising for production of complex microstructures with enhanced functionality and controlled properties. ",

    "abstract": "An exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) occurs when both the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a square matrix coincide and the matrix has a nontrivial Jordan block structure. It is not easy to achieve an EPD exactly. In our prior studies, we synthesized simple conservative (lossless) circuits with evolution matrices featuring EPDs by using two LC loops coupled by a gyrator. In this paper, we advance even a simpler circuit with an EPD consisting of only two LC loops with one capacitor shared. Consequently, this circuit involves only four elements and it is perfectly reciprocal. The shared capacitance and parallel inductance are negative with values determined by explicit formulas which lead to EPD. This circuit can have the same Jordan canonical form as the nonreciprocal circuit we introduced before. This implies that the Jordan canonical form does not necessarily manifest systems' nonreciprocity. It is natural to ask how nonreciprocity is manifested in the system's spectral data. Our analysis of this issue shows that nonreciprocity is manifested explicitly in: (i) the circuit Lagrangian and (ii) the breakdown of certain symmetries in the set of eigenmodes. All our significant theoretical findings were thoroughly tested and confirmed by extensive numerical simulations using commercial circuit simulator software. ",

In this study, we demonstrate the in-situ real-time observation of nanoscale azo-polymer motion by combining tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical system, allowing HS-AFM observations precisely aligned with a tightly focused laser position. We successfully observed the dynamic evolution of unique morphologies in azo-polymer films, attributed to photoinduced nano-movements. Moreover, real-time topographic line profile analyses facilitated precise and quantitative investigations of morphological changes, which provided novel insights into the deformation mechanism.

This has heralded novel devices, ranging from low-voltage and high-speed modulators to parametric amplifiers. For such photonic integrated circuits, a low-loss SiO2 cladding layer is a key element, serving as a passivation layer for the waveguides and enabling efficient fiber-to-chip coupling. However, numerous novel ferroelectric or III-V \"on insulator\" platforms have low tolerances for process temperature. This prohibits using high-temperature anneals to remove hydrogen, a common impurity that is inherent to ordinary chemical vapor deposited SiO2 and causes significant optical loss in the near infrared. Here, we satisfy the dichotomy of a low-loss wafer scale manufactured SiO2 cladding and low processing temperature. Inspired by the manufacturing of optical fibers, we introduce a hydrogen-free, low-loss SiO2 cladding that is deposited at low temperatures (300 degrees Celsius) by using SiCl4 and O2 as precursors in inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD). By replacing hydrogenous silicon precursors (e.g. SiH4) with SiCl4, the deposited film is inherently free from residual hydrogen. The process temperature is compatible with the \"on insulator\" platforms and CMOS electronic integrated circuits. We demonstrate a wide low-loss window that covers all telecommunication bands from 1260 nm to 1625 nm. We achieve a < 2.5 dB/m waveguide loss at 1550 nm, comparable with 1200 degree Celsius annealed films. Our SiCl4 process provides a key future cladding for all recently emerged \"on-insulator\" photonics platforms, that is low cost, scalable in manufacturing, and directly foundry compatible. ",

However, it is often unclear why the experimentally measured hyperpolarization is below the theoretical achievable maximum polarization. We report a (near-) resonant relaxation enhancement by microwave (MW) irradiation, leading to a significant increase in the nuclear polarization decay compared to measurements without MW irradiation. For example, the increased nuclear relaxation limits the achievable polarization levels to around 35% instead of hypothetical 60%, measured in the DNP material TEMPO in 1H glassy matrices at 3.3 K and 7 T. Applying rate-equation models to published build-up and decay data indicates that such relaxation enhancement is a common issue in many samples when using different radicals at low sample temperatures and high Boltzmann polarizations of the electrons. Accordingly, quantification and a better understanding of the relaxation processes under MW irradiation might help to design samples and processes towards achieving higher nuclear hyperpolarization levels.better understanding of the relaxation processes under MW irradiation might help to design samples and processes towards achieving higher nuclear hyperpolarization levels.

However, it is still in its initial stages of development and warrants further investigations to take it to the next level i.e., realization of optical charging based real-world systems. Engineering efficient optical charging process in turn necessitates efficient photo-thermal energy conversion, transfer as well as storage of the incident solar radiant energy. The present work is a determining step in deciphering, quantifying, and understanding the aforementioned steps involved in the optical charging process. In particular, experiments have been designed carefully to investigate optical charging of composite-PCMs (particles laden organic PCMs) with and without thermochromism assistance. Spatial-temporal temperature distribution curves reveal that temperature spread (in the liquid phase) in case of optical charging of non-thermochromic particles (carbon soot nanoparticles) laden PCMs is significantly high (as high as approximately 24 {\\deg}C) relative to that observed in case of thermochromic particles (microcapsules) laden PCMs (approximately, 4 {\\deg}C). The magnitude of the temperature spread (being representative of the deviation from thermostatic optical charging) clearly points out that opposed to non-thermochromic laden PCMs, nearly thermostatic optical charging can be achieved in case of thermochromic particles laden PCMs. Furthermore, in case of optical charging without thermochromic assistance, the temperature spread, peak temperatures and the melting rates increase with increase in particles concentration. Whereas, in the latter case, although the temperature spread and peak temperatures are nearly independent; the melting rates do depend on the particles concentration. ",

    "abstract": "One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics, potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity of the approximation. ",

    "title": "Quantum to Classical Cavity Chemistry Electrodynamics",
    "abstract": "Polaritonic chemistry has ushered in new avenues for controlling molecular dynamics. However, two key questions remain: (i) Can classical light sources elicit the same effects as certain quantum light sources on molecular systems? (ii) Can semiclassical treatments of light-matter interaction capture nontrivial quantum effects observed in molecular dynamics? This work presents a quantum-classical approach addressing issues of realizing cavity chemistry effects without actual cavities. It also highlights the limitations of the standard semiclassical light-matter interaction. It is demonstrated that classical light sources can mimic quantum effects up to the second order of light-matter interaction, provided that the mean-field contribution, symmetrized two-time correlation function, and the linear response function are the same in both situations. Numerical simulations show that the quantum-classical method aligns more closely with exact quantum molecular-only dynamics for quantum light states such as Fock states, superpositions of Fock states, and vacuum squeezed states than the conventional semiclassical approach.

    "title": "Spatiotemporal visualization of a surface acoustic wave coupled to  magnons across a submillimeter-long sample by pulsed laser interferometry",
    "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) coupled to magnons have attracted much attention because they allow for the long-range transport of magnetic information which cannot be achieved by magnon alone. We employed pulsed laser interferometry to visualize the entire spatiotemporal dynamics of a SAW that travels on a nickel (Ni) thin film and is coupled to magnons. It was possible to trace the coupling-induced amplitude reduction and phase shift that occurs as the SAW propagates over a distance of 0.4 mm. The observed changes are consistent with results obtained from conventional radio-frequency transmission measurements, which probe the total SAW absorption due to magnon--phonon coupling. This result verifies that our method can accurately capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of a SAW coupled to magnons across the entire length of the sample. Additionally, we validated our time-resolved profiles by comparing them with theoretical results that take the echo wave due to reflection into account. The impact of the echo wave is significant even when it has propagated over a distance on the order of millimeters. Our imaging results highlight the visualization of the long-range propagation of the SAW coupled to magnons and offer more information about the surface vibration profiles in such devices. ",

Any one-particle density that is square-integrable, has a square-integrable weak derivative, and is gapped away from zero can be realized from the solution of a many-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation, with or without interactions, by choosing a corresponding external potential. This potential can contain a distributional contribution but still gives rise to a self-adjoint Hamiltonian. Importantly, this allows for a well-defined Kohn-Sham procedure but, on the other hand, invalidates the usual proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. ",

We obtain the bound energy eigenstates of particles in a three-dimensional cylindrical nanowire under a confining hyperbolic potential with both open and closed boundary conditions in the radial and the axial directions. In the present model we consider carriers with continuous mass distributions within the dot with abrupt mass discontinuities at the barriers, moving in a quantum dot that connects different substances. Continuity of mass and potential at the interfaces with the external layers result as a particular case. Our approach is mostly analytical and allows a precise comparison among von Roos ordering classes. ",
