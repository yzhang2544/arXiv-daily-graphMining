Present photonic material platforms have significantly progressed over the past years; however, at the same time, they face critical challenges. We introduce a novel material for integrated photonics and investigate Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) templates as a platform for developing reconfigurable and on-chip nonlinear optical devices. AlGaN combines compatibility with standard fabrication technologies and high electro-optic modulation capabilities with reduced loss in a broad spectrum, making it a viable material for advanced photonic applications. We engineer and grow light-guiding photonic layers and fabricate waveguides, directional couplers, and other on-chip devices. Our AlGaN ring resonators demonstrate tunability and high Q-factors due to the low-loss waveguiding. The comprehensive platform paves the way for nonlinear photon-pair generation applications, on-chip nonlinear quantum frequency conversion, and fast electro-optic modulation for switching and routing.

    "title": "Principle of fundamental resonance in hypersonic boundary layers: an  asymptotic viewpoint",
    "abstract": "The fundamental resonance (FR) in the nonlinear phase of the boundary-layer transition to turbulence appears when a dominant planar instability mode reaches a finite amplitude, and the low-amplitude oblique traveling modes with the same frequency as the dominant mode, together with the stationary streak modes, undergo the strongest amplification among all the Fourier components. This regime may be the most efficient means to trigger the natural transition in hypersonic boundary layers. In this paper, we aim to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the FR in the weakly nonlinear framework based on the large-Reynolds-number asymptotic technique. It is found that the FR is in principle a triad resonance among a dominant planar fundamental mode, a streak mode and an oblique mode. In the major part of the boundary layer, the nonlinear interaction of the fundamental mode and the streak mode seeds for the growth of the oblique mode, whereas the interaction of the oblique mode and the fundamental mode drives the roll components (transverse and lateral velocity) of the streak mode, which leads to a stronger amplification of the streamwise component of the streak mode due to the lift-up mechanism. The main-layer solution of the streamwise velocity, spanwise velocity and temperature of both the streak and the oblique modes become singular as the wall is approached, and so a viscous wall layer appears underneath. The wall layer produces an outflux velocity to the main-layer solution, inclusion of which leads to an improved asymptotic theory, whose accuracy is confirmed by comparing with the calculations of the nonlinear parabolised stability equations (NPSE) at moderate Reynolds numbers and the secondary instability analysis (SIA) at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.

    "abstract": "Laser sensing has a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a pH sensing laser with an ultra-low threshold and low sample consumption based on a whispering-gallery-mode microbubble resonator. Rhodamine 6G aqueous solutions with different pH values are used as the lasing gain media, which are injected through the microfluidic channel and interact with the high-quality-factor microbubble resonator to achieve lasing. Subtle pH changes of the aqueous solution lead to changes in lasing intensity in real time and the threshold reaches a minimum of 0.091 uJ/mm2. The low pump energy density effectively avoids the self-aggregation and photobleaching effects of dye molecules present in high-concentration rhodamine 6G solutions. The lasing characteristics under different pH conditions were determined experimentally and theoretically, and the results are in good agreement. Due to the deprotonation of amino groups in highly alkaline environments, the lasing threshold is highly dependent on the pH of rhodamine 6G aqueous solutions. In the pH range of 10.16-13.14, the lasing intensity changes considerably with the increasing pH. The proposed pH-sensing laser exhibits a fast response time, low toxicity, and a high signal-to-noise ratio, making it promising for highly sensitive alkaline detection in biological applications. ",

However, tuning the individual SHNOs in large chains/arrays, which is key to implementing synaptic control, has remained a challenge. Here, we demonstrate circular memristive nano-gates, both precisely aligned and shifted with respect to nano-constriction SHNOs of W/CoFeB/HfOx, with increased quality of the device tunability. Gating at the exact center of the nano-constriction region is found to cause irreversible degradation to the oxide layer, resulting in a permanent frequency shift of the auto-oscillating modes. As a remedy, gates shifted outside of the immediate nano-constriction region can tune the frequency dramatically (>200 MHz) without causing any permanent change to the constriction region. Circular memristive nano-gates can, therefore, be used in SHNO chains/arrays to manipulate the synchronization states precisely over large networks of oscillators. ",

Defining the weights of the neural network connection using a quantum generator of truly random numbers, in agreement with the emerging concepts of quantum artificial intelligence and quantum cognition we reveal that the actual perceptual state of the Necker cube is a qubit-like superposition of the two fundamental perceptual states predicted by classical theories. Our results will find applications in video games and virtual reality systems employed for training of astronauts and operators of unmanned aerial vehicles.

In this model, the couplings between the system and the bath are obtained from the statistical average over the discrete, degenerate effective states. Our model is aimed at intermediate bath sizes in which non-Markovian processes and energy transfer between the bath and the main system are important. The method is applied to a model system of a Morse oscillator coupled to 40 harmonic modes. The results are found to be in excellent agreement with the direct quantum dynamics simulations of Bouakline et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 116, 11118-11127 (2012)], but at a much lower computational cost. Extension to larger baths is discussed in comparison to the time-convolutionless method. We also extend this study to the case of a microcanonical bath with finite initial internal energies. The computational efficiency and convergence properties of the effective bath states model with respect to relevant parameters are also discussed. ",

Capillary models play a significant role in the management of cryogenic propellants in space, where surface tension dominates the behaviour of gas-liquid interfaces. Yet, most empirical models have been derived in configurations dominated by viscous forces. In this study, we experimentally investigate the wetting of a low-viscosity, highly wetting fluid in a reduced gravity environment. Our setup consisted of a transparent and diverging U-tube in which capillary forces sustain the liquid motion. Combining Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and high-speed backlighting visualization, the experimental campaign allowed for measuring the interface evolution and the velocity field within the liquid under varying gravity levels. This work reports on the preliminary results from the image velocimetry and shows that the velocity profile within the tube is close to parabolic until a short distance from the interface. Nevertheless, classic 1D models for capillary rise face difficulties reproducing the interface dynamics, suggesting that the treatment of the surface tension in these problems must be reviewed. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is an acclaimed and widely used theoretical framework for modeling the continuous wave (CW) response and temporal dynamics of any integrated or free-space photonic resonant structure. It was initially employed to understand how energy is coupled into and out of a cavity and how it is exchanged between different resonant modes. In the 30 years that followed its establishment, CMT has been expanded to describe a broad range of nonlinear interactions as well (self- and cross-phase modulation, saturable absorption, frequency generation, gain, etc.). In this tutorial, we thoroughly present the basic principles and the evolution of CMT throughout the years, showcasing its immense capabilities for the analysis and design of linear and nonlinear resonant photonic systems. Importantly, we focus on examples of modern, open nanophotonic resonators incorporating contemporary bulk or sheet (2D) materials that may be lossy and dispersive. For each linear/nonlinear effect under study we follow a meticulous, step-by-step approach, starting from an accurate model of the physical phenomenon and proceeding to its introduction in the CMT framework all the way to the efficient solution of the resulting system of equations. Our work highlights the merits of CMT as an efficient, accurate, and versatile theoretical tool. We envision that it can serve both as an introductory reference for any reader, as well as a comprehensive handbook on how to incorporate a broad range of linear and nonlinear effects in the CMT framework.

The influences of dielectrics on the fields are replaced by equivalent volume sources through the use of the compensation theorem in electromagnetic theory. The resonant frequencies can be determined by finding the roots of the determinant of the matrix resulted from the discretization of the real homogeneous volume-surface integral equation derived from the requirement that the difference of stored field energies in the source region vanishes. As applications of the extended RMT, three examples have been investigated. The first example is a dielectric resonator antenna, and is designed by exciting the first resonant mode of the composite structure in which the dielectric cylinder is combined with a conformal metallic strip. The second example is a dual-band dielectric-coated metallic wire antenna. The third example studies the resonant modes of a rectangular patch antenna. ",

As quantum computing endeavors scale up, the demand for higher laser power with ultra-narrow linewidth becomes imperative, and leveraging fiber amplifiers emerges as a promising approach to meet these requirements. This study explores the effectiveness of Thulium-doped fiber amplifiers as a viable solution for addressing optical qubit transitions in trapped barium ion qubits. We demonstrate that by performing high-fidelity gates on the qubit while introducing minimal intensity noise, TDFAs do not significantly broaden the linewidth of the seed lasers. We employed a Voigt fitting scheme in conjunction with a delayed self-heterodyne method to accurately measure the linewidth independently, corroborating our findings through quadrupole spectroscopy with trapped barium ions. Our results show linewidth values of $\\sim$ $160$~Hz and $156$~Hz, respectively, using these two methods, underscoring the reliability of our measurement techniques. The slight variation between the two methods may be attributed to factors such as amplified spontaneous emission in the TDFA or the influence of $1/f$ noise within the heterodyne setup delay line. These contribute to advancing our understanding of laser linewidth control in the context of ion trap quantum computing as well as stretching the availability of narrow linewidth, high-power tunable lasers beyond the C-band.

    "abstract": "We investigate the properties of a two-dimensional \\emph{spinor} microcavity polariton system driven by a linearly polarised continuous pump. In particular, we establish the role of the elementary excitations, namely the so-called half-vortices and full-vortices; these objects carry a quantum rotation only in one of the two, or both, spin components respectively. Our numerical analysis of the steady-state shows that it is only the half-vortices that are present in the vortex-antivortex pairing/dissociation responsible for the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. These are the relevant elementary excitations close to the critical point. However, by exploring the phase-ordering dynamics following a sudden quench across the transition we prove that full-vortices become the relevant excitations away from the critical point in a deep quasi-ordered state at late times. The time-scales for half-vortices binding into full vortices are much faster than the vortex-antivortex annihilations. ",

We identify various phases as the atom number and the angular momentum/angular velocity of the trap vary. These phases include center-of-mass-like excitation (without, or with vortices), vortices of single and multiple quantization, etc. Finally, we compare our results with those of the single-component problem.
