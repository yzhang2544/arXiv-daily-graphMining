    "abstract": "We present a quantum algorithm for factoring products of prime numbers which exploits Grover search to factor any $n$-bit biprime using $2n-5$ qubits or less. The algorithm doesn't depend on any properties of the number to be factored, has guaranteed convergence, and doesn't require complex classical pre or post-processing. Large scale simulations confirm a success probability asymptotically reaching 100% for $>800$ random biprimes with $5\\leq n\\leq 35$ (corresponding to $5 - 65$ qubits) with the largest being $30398263859 = 7393\\times 4111763$. We also present a variant of the algorithm based on digital adiabatic quantum computing and show that Grover based factorization requires quadratically fewer iteration steps in most cases. ",

However, while there has been discourse about how to use AI responsibly, there is still little appreciation and awareness among executives, managers, and practitioners about the broader ethical questions and implications raised by the intersection of these emerging technologies. In this article, it is highlighted why quantum computing and AI ethics must be taken seriously by businesspersons and how these technologies affect strategic decisions; moreover, recommendations and action areas are formulated.

Such type of SR is observed experimentally for the first time, and in particular, in such as complex polymer chaotic channel flow. We observe that SR does not appear close to the inlet, where streamwise velocity fluctuations, $u_{rms}$, are much larger. Far away from the inlet, $u_{rms}$ fluctuations become small and about the same until outlet resulting in flat spanwise velocity, $w$, power spectrum in lower subrange of transition regime. Then interaction of chaotic $u$ power spectrum with white noise $w$ energy spectrum in the presence of low intensity elastic wave promotes SR, as predicted by internal dynamics of autonomous nonlinear dynamical model. Appearance of chaotic $w$ power spectrum at higher $u_{rms}$ results in vanishing of SR. Moreover, SR frequency, $f_p$, shows the same scaling exponent as elastic wave frequency, $f_{el}$, in the dependence on $Wi$, with $f_p$ significantly shifted down compared to $f_{el}$ that indicates their close relation.

By employing the $5s5p{\\;^{3} P_{0}} \\rightarrow 5s5d{\\;^3}D_1 $ (483 nm) transition in combination with the excitation of $5s5p{\\;^3}P_2 \\rightarrow 5s6s{\\;^3}S_1$ (707 nm) transition, we observe a significant increase ($\\sim$ 13 fold) in the steady state number of atoms in the magneto-optic trap (MOT).

The absolute transition frequencies were measured with an absolute accuracy of 30 MHz. To support our measurements, we performed Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of the relevant parameters in Sr. To further increase the accuracy of the calculated properties, corrections from the Breit, QED and perturbative triples were also included. The calculated branching ratio for the repumping state confirms the significantly increased population in the ${^3}P_1$ state. Thereby, leading to an increase of population of atoms trapped due to the enhanced repumping. Our calculated hyperfine-splitting energies are in excellent agreement with the measured values. Moreover, our calculated isotope shifts in the transition frequencies are in good agreement with our measured values. ",

However, integrated multi-color Raman microlasers have yet to be demonstrated because of the requirement of high-Q microresonators possessing large second-order nonlinearity and strong Raman phonon branches and the challenging in cavity-enhanced multi-photon hyper-Raman scattering parametric process. In this work, integrated multi-color Raman lasers have been demonstrated for the first time at weak pump levels, via the excitation of high-Q (>6 X 10^6) phase-matched modes in single thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) microresonators by dispersion engineering. Raman lasing was observed at 1712 nm for a 1546-nm pump threshold power of only 620 uW. Furthermore, multi-color Raman lasers were realized at discrete wavelengths of 1712 nm, 813 nm, 533 nm and 406 nm with pump levels as low as 1.60 mW, which is more than two order of magnitude lower than the current records (i.e., 200 mW) in bulk resonators, allowed by the fulfillment of the requisite conditions consisting of broadband natural phase match, multiple-resonance and high Q-factors.

Here, we demonstrate an optical means of the time-interval measurement of electrical signals that can successfully achieve femtosecond (fs)-level precision. The setup is established using the optical-frequency-comb (OFC)-based linear optical sampling technique to realize timescale-stretched measurement. We achieve the measurement precision of 82 fs for a single LOS scan measurement and 3.05 fs for the 100-times average with post-processing, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the results of older electrical methods.

The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non-volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub-micron-sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free-space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non-mechanical, non-volatile transmissive filter based on low-loss PCMs with a 200 $\\mu$m$ \\times $200 $\\mu$m switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low- and high-transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free-space reconfigurable optics based on PCMs. ",

At their core, these circuits rely on reconfigurable phase shifters, typically constructed from classical components such as thermo- or electro-optical materials, while quantum solid-state emitters such as quantum dots are limited to acting as single-photon sources. Here, we demonstrate the potential of quantum dots as reconfigurable phase shifters. We use numerical models based on established literature parameters to show that circuits utilizing these emitters enable high-fidelity operation and are scalable. Despite the inherent imperfections associated with quantum dots, such as imperfect coupling, dephasing, or spectral diffusion, our optimization shows that these do not significantly impact the unitary infidelity. Specifically, they do not increase the infidelity by more than 0.001 in circuits with up to 10 modes, compared to those affected only by standard nanophotonic losses and routing errors. For example, we achieve fidelities of 0.9998 in quantum-dot-based circuits enacting controlled-phase and -not gates without any redundancies. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of quantum emitter-driven quantum information processing and pave the way for cryogenically-compatible, fast, and low-loss reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits.

In the first case, we explore the impact of the chirp parameter on the properties of single-photon TWFs. We show that by properly adjusting the chirp parameter, it is possible to compensate for the detrimental effects of chromatic dispersion, allowing for the maintenance of high-fidelity transmission of quantum information over long distances. Furthermore, we examine the effects of chromatic dispersion on a qubit defined in the time domain, illustrating how this phenomenon can influence the transmission of information encoded in time-bins. Finally, we consider non-Gaussian TWFs that are represented by hyperbolic-secant modes. Our results provide important insights into the design and implementation of high-speed and long-distance quantum communication systems. The findings underscore the potential for using chirp management techniques to mitigate the effects of chromatic dispersion. ",

We primarily do so through the task of partial state learning: tomographic protocols for acquiring a reduced, but sufficient, classical description of a quantum system. Developing fast methods for partial tomography addresses a critical bottleneck in quantum simulation algorithms, which is a particularly pressing issue for currently available, imperfect quantum machines. At the same time, in the search for such protocols, we also refine our notion of what it means to learn quantum states. One important example is the ability to articulate, from a computational perspective, how the learning of fermions contrasts with other types of particles. ",

    "title": "Gravitational wave memory and quantum Michelson interferometer",
    "abstract": "We examined the output of a quantum Michelson interferometer incorporating the combined effects of nonlinear optomechanical interaction and time-varying gravitational fields. Our findings indicate a deviation from the standard relationship between the phase shift of the interferometer's output and the amplitude of gravitational waves. This deviation, a slight offset in direct proportionality, is associated with the velocity memory effect of gravitational waves. Furthermore, the results suggest that consecutive gravitational wave memory, or the stochastic gravitational wave memory background, contributes not only to the classical displacement-induced red noise spectrum but also to a quantum noise spectrum through a new mechanism associated with velocity memory background. This leads to a novel quantum noise limit for interferometers, which may be crucial for higher precision detection system. Our analysis potentially offers a more accurate description of quantum interferometers responding to gravitational waves and applies to other scenarios involving time-varying gravitational fields. It also provides insights and experimental approaches for exploring how to unify the quantum effects of macroscopic objects and gravitation. ",

    "abstract": "Foundation models, exemplified by GPT technology, are discovering new horizons in artificial intelligence by executing tasks beyond their designers' expectations. While the present generation provides fundamental advances in understanding language and images, the next frontier is video comprehension. Progress in this area must overcome the 1 Tb/s data rate demanded to grasp real-time multidimensional video information. This speed limit lies well beyond the capabilities of the existing generation of hardware, imposing a roadblock to further advances. This work introduces a hardware-accelerated integrated optoelectronic platform for multidimensional video understanding in real-time. The technology platform combines artificial intelligence hardware, processing information optically, with state-of-the-art machine vision networks, resulting in a data processing speed of 1.2 Tb/s with hundreds of frequency bands and megapixel spatial resolution at video rates. Such performance, validated in the AI tasks of video semantic segmentation and object understanding in indoor and aerial applications, surpasses the speed of the closest technologies with similar spectral resolution by three to four orders of magnitude. This platform opens up new avenues for research in real-time AI video understanding of multidimensional visual information, helping the empowerment of future human-machine interactions and cognitive processing developments.

    "abstract": "Trapped ion systems are a leading platform for quantum information processing, but they are currently limited to 1D and 2D arrays, which imposes restrictions on both their scalability and their range of applications. Here, we propose a path to overcome this limitation by demonstrating that Penning traps can be used to realize remarkably clean bilayer crystals, wherein hundreds of ions self-organize into two well-defined layers. These bilayer crystals are made possible by the inclusion of an anharmonic trapping potential, which is readily implementable with current technology. We study the normal modes of this system and discover salient differences compared to the modes of single-plane crystals. The bilayer geometry and the unique properties of the normal modes open new opportunities in quantum information processing that are not straightforward in single-plane crystals. Furthermore, we illustrate that it may be possible to extend the ideas presented here to realize multilayer crystals with more than two layers. Our work increases the dimensionality of trapped ion systems by efficiently utilizing all three spatial dimensions and lays the foundation for a new generation of quantum information processing experiments with multilayer 3D crystals of trapped ions.

    "abstract": "We show that a simple system consisting of a two-level emitter and few cavities could realize a high-fidelity deterministic controlled-$\\pi$-phase gate for traveling single-photon qubits. The gate relies on the optimal setting of the coupling rates among the emitter and cavities and the use of photon wavepackets with an appropriate temporal shape, which could simply the gate operation to a process of complete absorption and re-emission of the wavepackets. consequently, it is free of wavepacket distortions, circumventing the long-standing challenge associated with the use of nonlinear media as a phase gate. Undergoing the process of absorption and re-emission, the two-level emitter enables a nonlinear $\\pi$ phase shift for the two-photon wavepacket. The gate fidelity could reach over 99% with only four cavities. The proposed gate is passive and its architecture is compatible with integrated photonic platforms and in line with recent developments in quantum photonics. ",

    "abstract": "In bulk materials, the collective modes and individual modes are orthogonal each other, and no connection occurs if there is no damping processes. In the presence of damping, the collective modes, i.e., plasmons decay into the hot carriers. In finite systems, the collective and individual modes are coupled by the Coulomb interaction. Such couplings by longitudinal (L) field have been intensively investigated, whereas a coupling via transverse (T) field has been poorly studied although the plasmon is excited by an irradiated light on surface and in finite nanostructures. Then, the T field would play a significant role in the coupling between the collective and individual excitations. In this study, we investigate how the T field mediates the coherent coupling. This study is based on the recently developed microscopic nonlocal theory of electronic systems in metals and the results of eigenmode analyses by this theory. To tune the coupling strength in a single nanorod, we examine three parameters: Rod length $L_z$, background refractive index $n_{\\rm b}$, and Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$. We discuss the modulation ratio of the spectrum of optical response coefficients to evaluate the coupling by the T field. The T field shifts the collective excitation energy, which causes a finite modulation at both collective excitation and individual excitations. The three parameters can change the energy distance between the collective and individual excitations. Thus, the coherent coupling by the T field is enhanced for a proper tuning of the parameters. The results of the investigation of system parameter dependence would give insight into the guiding principle of designing the materials for highly efficient hot carrier generation. ",

The motional state, i.e., the phonon state, is taken into account. In addition to the decoherence due to the variance of differential light shift (DLS), a new decoherence mechanism, phonon-jumping-induced decoherence (PJID), is discovered and verified experimentally. A coherence time of $T_2\\approx 20$ s is then obtained for a single Cs atom by suppressing both variances of DLS and PJID by trapping the atom in a blue-detuned BBT and preparing the atom into its three-dimensional motional ground states. Our work opens a new prospect to extend the coherence time of optically trapped single atoms. ",

They can also be used as readout electronic, charge sensor or switch in quantum nanocircuits. A short and impurity-free constriction with superconducting contacts is a Cooper pairs QPC analogue known as superconducting quantum point contact (SQPC). The technological development of such quantum devices has been prolonged due to the challenges of maintaining their geometrical requirement and near-unity superconductor-semiconductor interface transparency. Here, we develop advanced nanofabrication, material and device engineering techniques and report on an innovative realisation of nanoscale SQPC arrays with split gate technology in semiconducting 2D electron systems, exploiting the special gate tunability of the quantum wells, and report the first experimental observation of conductance quantization in hybrid InGaAs-Nb SQPCs. We observe reproducible quantized conductance at zero magnetic fields in multiple quantum nanodevices fabricated in a single chip and systematically investigate the quantum transport of SQPCs at low and high magnetic fields for their potential applications in quantum metrology, for extremely accurate voltage standards, and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.
