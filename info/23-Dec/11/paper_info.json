    "abstract": "The influence of the topology and curvature of objects on photonic properties represents an intriguing fundamental problem from cosmology to nanostructure physics. The classical topological transition from a ring to a M\\\"obius strip is accompanied by a loss of part of the wavelength, compensated by the Berry phase. In contrast, a strip with the same curvature but without a 180{\\deg} rotation has a zero Berry phase. Here we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the topological transition from a ring to a flat split ring accumulated both such effects. By cutting a flat dielectric ring of rectangular cross-section, we observe the lifting of the degeneracy of the CW-CCW modes of the ring and the formation of two families: topological modes that acquire an additional phase in the range from 0 to {\\pi} depending on the gap width, and ordinary modes that do not acquire an additional phase. An order parameter is introduced that accurately describes the magnitude of the spectral splitting of ordinary and topological modes. We established that an arbitrary non-integer number of waves can fit along the length of a dielectric split ring resonator, creating a new avenue in classical and quantum photonic applications. ",

    "abstract": "Resonant upconversion through a sixth order relativistic nonlinearity resulting in a unique resonance was recently proposed [V. M. Malkin and N. J. Fisch, Physical Review E 108, 045208 (2023)]. The high order resonance is a unique non-integer multiple of a driving pump frequency resulting in a frequency upshift by a factor of $\\approx 3.73$. We demonstrate the presence, unique requirements, and growth of this mode numerically. Through tuning waves to high amplitude, in a mildly underdense plasma, the six-photon process may grow more than other non-resonant, but lower order processes. The growth of the high frequency mode remains below the nonlinear growth regime. However, extending current numerical results to more strongly coupled resonances with longer pulse propagation distances suggests a pathway to significant upconversion. ",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of solid states using intense infrared or terahertz light fields is a pivotal area in contemporary ultrafast photonics research. While conventional circular polarization has been well explored, the potential of counterrotating bicircular light remains widely underexplored, despite growing interest in theory. In the mid-infrared or multi-terahertz region, experimental challenges lie in difficulties in stabilizing the relative phase between two-color lights and the lack of available polarization elements. Here, we successfully generated phase-stable counterrotating bicircular light pulses in the 10-40 THz frequency range circumventing the above problems. Employing spectral broadening, polarization pulse shaping with a spatial light modulator, and intra-pulse difference frequency generation leveraging a distinctive angular-momentum selection rule within the nonlinear crystal, we achieved direct conversion from near-infrared pulses into the designed counterrotating bicircular multi-terahertz pulses. Use of the spatial light modulator enables programmable control over the shape, orientation, rotational symmetry, and helicity of the bicircular light field trajectory. This advancement provides a novel pathway for the programmable manipulation of light fields, and marks a significant step toward understanding and harnessing the impact of tailored light fields on matter, particularly in the context of topological semimetals.

In order to resolve this disagreement the nonlinear Kerr index of a bulk sample of lead halide perovskite was measured directly by means of an interferometer.

The wires are wound by-hand onto machined panels which are retrofitted onto the existing mounting structure of the sensor without interfering with any experimental components.

In the photoionization scenario, there has been a strong focus on probing the physical manifestations of the internal quantum coherence within the individual parent ion and photoelectron systems. However, quantum correlations between these two subsystems emerging from the attosecond photoionization event have thus far remained much more elusive. In this work, we design theoretically and model numerically a direct probe of quantum entanglement in attosecond photoionization in the form of a Bell test. We simulate from first principles a Bell test protocol for the case of noble gas atoms photoionized by ultrashort, circularly polarized infrared laser pulses in the strong-field regime predicting robust violation of the Bell inequality. This theoretical result paves the way to the direct observation of entanglement in the context of ultrafast photoionization of many-electron systems. Our work provides a different perspective on attosecond physics directed towards the detection of quantum correlations between systems born during attosecond photoionization and unravelling the signatures of entanglement in the ultrafast coherent molecular dynamics, including in the chemical decomposition pathways of molecular ions.

For many quantum applications, high collection efficiency from individual emitters is required, but the refractive index mismatch between diamond and air limits the optimal collection efficiency with conventional diamond device geometries. While different out-coupling methods with near-unity efficiency exist, many have yet to be realized due to current limitations in nanofabrication methods, especially for mechanically hard materials like diamond. Here, we leverage electron-beam-induced etching to modify Sn-implanted diamond quantum microchiplets containing integrated waveguides with width and thickness of 280 nm and 200 nm, respectively. This approach allows for simultaneous high-resolution imaging and modification of the host matrix with an open geometry and direct writing. When coupled with the cathodoluminescence signal generated from the electron-emitter interactions, we can monitor the enhancement of the quantum emitters in real-time with nanoscale spatial resolution. The operando measurement and manipulation of single photon emitters demonstrated here provides a new foundation for the control of emitter-cavity interactions in integrated quantum photonics. ",

However, the performance of these resonators in fluid environments is limited by significant viscous and acoustic radiation losses that reduce their Q. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting discovery that challenges the conventional wisdom of resonant sensing in fluids. We report an optimal volume of fluid over a 2D micro-resonator that increases the Q by up to 1000% compared to that in air. We have conducted precise experiments on piezoelectric, circular, membrane-type micro-resonators of 4 mm diameter fabricated using MEMS technology on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The top side of the resonator was filled with different volumes of fluid and its Q was measured through resonance tracking by actuating the resonator with an appropriate voltage. We found the existence of an optimal volume of fluid that maximized the Q. We argue that this phenomenon is a result of a balance between the enhancement of kinetic energy of the resonator due to mass loading of the fluid and the energy dissipation through viscous and acoustic radiation losses in the fluid medium. This remarkable enhancement in Q substantially improves the sensitivity of the resonator, with important implications for diverse applications such as biosensing, chemical detection, and environmental monitoring. Our findings challenge the prevailing understanding of resonant sensing in fluids and open up new avenues for the development of highly sensitive and accurate sensors. ",

Here we show that nanomechanical frequency spectroscopy can be used to characterize the absorption of a dielectric thin film at the parts-per-million (ppm) level, and use it to characterize the absorption of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a ubiquitous low-loss optomechanical material. Specifically, we track the frequency shift of a high-$Q$ Si$_3$N$_4$ trampoline resonator in response to photothermal heating by a $\\sim10$ mW laser beam, and infer the absorption of the thin film from a model including thermal stress relaxation and both radiative and conductive heat transfer. A key insight is the presence of two thermalization timescales, a rapid ($\\sim0.1$ sec) timescale due to radiative thermalization of the Si$_3$N$_4$ thin film, and a slow ($\\sim100$ sec) timescale due to parasitic heating of the Si device chip. We infer the extinction coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be $\\sim0.1-1$ ppm in the 532 - 1550 nm wavelength range, comparable to bounds set by waveguide resonators and notably lower than estimates with membrane-in-the-middle cavity optomechanical systems.

    "abstract": "Regularization is critical in solving the ill-posed geo-physical inversion problems. Explicit regularization is often used, but there are opportunities to explore the implicit regularization effect inherently from a Neural Network structure. Researchers in Computer Vision (CV) have discovered that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture inherently enforces a regularization that is advantageous for addressing diverse CV inverse problems, including de-noising and in-painting. In this study, we examine the applicability of this implicit regularization to geophysical inversions. The CNN maps an arbitrary vector to the model space (e.g. log-conductivity on the simulation mesh). The predicted subsurface model is then fed into a forward numerical simulation process to generate corresponding predicted measurements. Subsequently, the objective function value is computed by comparing these predicted measurements with the observed field measurements. The backpropagation algorithm is employed to update the trainable parameters of the CNN during the inversion. Note that the CNN in our proposed method does not require training before the inversion, rather, the CNN weights are estimated in the inversion algorithm, hence this is a test-time learning (TTL) approach. The results demonstrate that the implicit regularization provided by the CNN can be useful in DC resistivity inversions. We also provide a detailed discussion of the potential sources of this implicit regularization and some practical guides for applying the proposed method to other geophysical scenarios. The proposed approach for reparameterizing the inverse problem can be adapted to other Tikhonov-style geophysical inversions. ",

When the slab thickness is much smaller than the THz wavelength in the ferroelectric, the analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations from a dynamical phase-field model that incorporates the coupled dynamics of strain, polarization, and EM wave in multiphase systems. At larger thicknesses, the transmission is mainly determined by the frequency-dependent attenuation of THz waves in the ferroelectric and the formation of a standing polarization/THz wave.

At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often neglected in simple systems. However, in \"loop-coupled\" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for building nonreciprocal devices. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simple, experimentally realizable protocol that can prepare any specific superposition of permutationally invariant qubit states, also known as Dicke states. The protocol is comprised entirely of global rotations and globally applied non-linear phase gates -- it does not require local addressability or ancilla qubits -- and hence can be readily implemented in a variety of experimental platforms, including trapped-ion quantum simulators and cavity QED systems. We demonstrate the utility of our protocol by numerically preparing several states with theoretical infidelities $1-\\mathcal{F}<10^{-4}$: (i) metrologically useful $N$-qubit Dicke states in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ gate steps, (ii) the $N = 9$ qubit codewords of the Ruskai code with $P = 4$ gate steps, and (iii) the $N = 13$ qubit Gross codewords in $P = 7$ gate steps. Focusing on trapped-ion platforms, we estimate that the protocol achieves fidelities $\\gtrsim 95\\%$ in the presence of typical experimental noise levels, thus providing a pathway to the preparation of a variety of useful highly-entangled quantum states.
