    "abstract": "Deciphering ion channel activity and signaling interactions within cells is one of the key tasks of neuroscience. Currently, measuring this electrophysiological activity is done using patch-clamp1-4 or voltage-sensitive imaging5-8. Unfortunately, these techniques are unable to balance between single-channel sensitivity and highthroughput detection. Here we introduce a label-free electrochemical-modulated interferometric scattering microscope (EM-iSCAT) to measure ion channel activity on living cells at both whole-cell and single-channel levels. We visualize the cellular responses dynamics to osmotic stimulation, and record open-close trajectories of single N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors channels with a frame rate of 1.5 kHz. Furthermore, we localize and distinguish different kinds of ion channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+) on cell membrane and monitor spatio-temporal heterogeneous responses between different cells in a network. The high-throughput and single-channel sensitive nature of EMiSCAT microscopy allows monitoring simultaneously the activity of individual channels, their localization, and clustering in the cellular community. Our imaging concept opens the possibility to study any kind of ion channels, and more broadly, cell communication mediated by ion channels. ",

The study was carried out using femtosecond (35 fs) and nanosecond (7 ns) pulsed laser radiation sources. Experimental dependences of the volumetric hydrogen content in the gas mixture at the outlet of the reactor were measured depending on the propane supply rate. Equations have been proposed that describe the amount of hydrogen produced, taking into account the propane supply rate and the effect of its mixing with the resulting hydrogen. The resulting equations can be applied to the plasma-chemical decomposition of other hydrocarbons. Their application to experimentally studied processes made it possible to calculate the maximum possible efficiency of hydrogen production for the given characteristics of laser radiation. The results obtained made it possible to give recommendations on changing the parameters of laser radiation in order to increase the efficiency of the plasma-chemical process. ",

    "abstract": "Modelling the acoustic scattering response due to penetrable objects of arbitrary shapes, such as those of many marine organisms, can be computationally intensive, often requiring high-performance computing equipment when considering a completely general situation. However, when the physical properties (sound speed and density) of the scatterer object under consideration are similar to those of the surrounding medium, the Born approximation provides a computationally efficient way to calculate the scattering. For simple geometrical shapes like spheres and spheroids, the acoustic scattering in the far field can be evaluated through the Born approximation recipe as a formula which has been historically employed to predict the response of weakly scattering organisms, such as zooplankton. Moreover, the Born approximation has been extended to bodies whose geometry can be described as a collection of non-circular rings centred on a smooth curve. In this work, we have developed a numerical approach to calculate the far-field backscattering by arbitrary 3D objects under the Born approximation. The object's geometry is represented by a volumetric mesh composed of tetrahedrons, and the computation is efficiently performed through analytical 3D integration, yielding a solution expressed in terms of elementary functions for each tetrahedron. The method's correctness has been successfully validated against benchmark solutions. Additionally, we present acoustic scattering results for species with complex shapes. To enable other researchers to use and validate the method a computational package named tetrascatt implemented in the R programming language was developed and published in the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

These properties enabled Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based devices to demonstrate amplitude- and in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulation at voltage levels compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. Maintaining low-voltage operation requires centimeter-scale device lengths, making it challenging to realize the large-scale circuits required by ever-increasing bandwidth demands in data communications. Reduced device sizes reaching the 10 um scale are possible with photonic crystal (PhC) cavities. So far, their operation has been limited to modulation of amplitudes and required circulators or lacked cascadability. Here, we demonstrate a compact IQ modulator using two PhC cavities operating as phase shifters in a Fabry-Perot-enhanced Michelson interferometer configuration. It supports cascadable amplitude and phase modulation at GHz bandwidths with CMOS-compatible voltages. While the bandwidth limitation of resonant devices is often considered detrimental, their compactness enables dense co-integration with CMOS electronics where clock-rate-level operation (few GHz) removes power-hungry electrical time-multiplexing. Recent demonstrations of chip-scale transceivers with dense-wavelength division multiplied transceivers could be monolithically implemented and driven toward ultimate information densities using TFLN electro-optic frequency combs and our PhC IQ modulators.

Photonic decision-making is a promising approach that uses photonic computing technologies to solve the multi-armed bandit problem based on reinforcement learning. Photonic decision making using chaotic mode competition dynamics has been proposed. However, the experimental conditions for achieving superior decision-making performance have not yet been established. In this study, we experimentally investigate the mode competition dynamics in a chaotic multimode semiconductor laser in the presence of optical feedback and injection. We control chaotic mode-competition dynamics via optical injection, and we found that positive wavelength detuning results in an efficient mode concentration to one of the longitudinal modes with a small optical injection power. We experimentally investigate two-dimensional bifurcation map of the laser dynamics of the total intensity. Complex mixed dynamics are observed in the presence of optical feedback and injection. We experimentally conduct decision making to solve the bandit problem using chaotic mode-competition dynamics. A fast mode concentration property is observed at positive wavelength detuning, which resulted in a fast convergence of the correct decision rate. Our findings could be useful in accelerating the decision-making performance in adaptive optical networks using reinforcement learning. ",

Modeling of the strip structure allowed to determine the frequency dependence of the complex propagation coefficient, indicating the cause of quasi-chaotic oscillations due to the occurrence of a large number of normal waves and their interference.

This paper introduces the principles of the IOES and quantitatively evaluates the impact of humidity on measurement accuracy. Sensors with different levels of hydrophobicity coatings and hygroscopicity shells are fabricated and tested across the relative humidity (RH) range of 25% to 95%. Results reveal that humidity stability is primarily influenced by water vapor absorption through the sensor shell, which increases its conductivity. This further results in amplitude deviation and phase shift of the sensor output. To address this, an optimal humidity-stable packaging scheme is proposed, which involves using PEEK shell with room temperature vulcanized fluorinated silicone rubber coating. Compared with uncoated ceramic shell, the phase shift of the IOES reduces from 90$^\\circ$ to 1$^\\circ$ under a RH of 90%. The amplitude deviation of electric field measurement decreases from 20% to nearly zero after a 20-hour humidity experiment conducted under RH of 90% at 30 $^\\circ$C.

We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\\sim 20 \\%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model. ",

To date, the use of the quantum nature of parametrically generated light as a further resource for computation represents a major open issue. A key quantum feature is the non-Gaussian character of the system state across the oscillation threshold. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis of the emergence of non-Gaussianity in the single quantum OPO with an applied external field. We model the OPO by a Lindblad master equation, which is numerically solved by an ab initio method based on exact diagonalization. Non-Gaussianity is quantified by means of three different metrics: Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and photon distribution. Our findings reveal a nontrivial interplay between parametric drive and applied field: (i) Increasing pump monotonously enhances non-Gaussianity, and (ii) Increasing field first sharpens non-Gaussianity, and then restores the Gaussian character of the state when above a threshold value.

It has recently been used to identify the presence of individuals infected with COVID-19. To monitor large communities and accurately localize buildings with infected individuals with a limited number of sensors, one must carefully choose the sampling locations in wastewater networks. We also have to account for concentration requirements on the collected wastewater samples to ensure reliable virus presence test results. We model this as a sensor placement problem. Although sensor placement for source localization arises in numerous problems, most approaches use application-specific heuristics and fail to consider multiple source scenarios. To address these limitations, we develop a novel approach that combines Bayesian networks and discrete optimization to efficiently identify informative sensor placements and accurately localize virus sources. Our approach also takes into account concentration requirements on wastewater samples during optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the quality of our sensor placements and the accuracy of our source localization approach. Furthermore, we show the robustness of our approach to discrepancies between the virus outbreak model and the actual outbreak rates. ",

    "title": "Multidimensional Soliton Systems",
    "abstract": "This concise review aims to provide a summary of the most relevant recent experimental and theoretical results for solitons, i.e., self-trapped bound states of nonlinear waves, in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) media. In comparison with commonly known one-dimensional solitons, which are, normally, stable modes, a challenging problem is the propensity of 2D and 3D solitons to instability, caused by the occurrence of the critical or supercritical wave collapse (catastrophic self-compression) in the same spatial dimension. A remarkable feature of multidimensional solitons is their ability to carry vorticity; however, 2D vortex rings and 3D vortex tori are subject to strong splitting instability. Therefore, it is natural to categorize the basic results according to physically relevant settings which make it possible to maintain stability of fundamental (non-topological) and vortex solitons against the collapse and splitting, respectively. The present review is focused on schemes that were recently elaborated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensates and similar photonic setups. These are two-component systems with spin-orbit coupling, and ones stabilized by the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang effect. The latter setting has been implemented experimentally, giving rise to stable self-trapped quasi-2D and 3D \"quantum droplets\". ",
