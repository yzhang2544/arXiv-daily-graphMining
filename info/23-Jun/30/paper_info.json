    "title": "Lithium tantalate electro-optical photonic integrated circuits for high  volume manufacturing",
    "abstract": "Photonic integrated circuits based on Lithium Niobate have demonstrated the vast capabilities afforded by material with a high Pockels coefficient, allowing linear and high-speed modulators operating at CMOS voltage levels for applications ranging from data-center communications and photonic accelerators for AI. However despite major progress, the industrial adoption of this technology is compounded by the high cost per wafer. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a photonic platform that satisfies the dichotomy of allowing scalable manufacturing at low cost, while at the same time exhibiting equal, and superior properties to those of Lithium Niobate. We demonstrate that it is possible to manufacture low loss photonic integrated circuits using Lithium Tantalate, a material that is already commercially adopted for acoustic filters in 5G and 6G. We show that LiTaO3 posses equally attractive optical properties and can be etched with high precision and negligible residues using DUV lithography, diamond like carbon (DLC) as a hard mask and alkaline wet etching. Using this approach we demonstrate microresonators with an intrinsic cavity linewidth of 26.8 MHz, corresponding to a linear loss of 5.6 dB/m and demonstrate a Mach Zehnder modulator with Vpi L = 4.2 V cm half-wave voltage length product. In comparison to Lithium Niobate, the photonic integrated circuits based on LiTaO3 exhibit a much lower birefringence, allowing high-density circuits and broadband operation over all telecommunication bands (O to L band), exhibit higher photorefractive damage threshold, and lower microwave loss tangent. Moreover, we show that the platform supports generation of soliton microcombs in X-Cut LiTaO3 racetrack microresonator with electronically detectable repetition rate, i.e. 30.1 GHz. ",

    "abstract": "Many successful machine learning methods have been developed for electromagnetic inverse scattering problems. However, so far, their inversion has been performed only at the specifically trained frequencies. To make the machine-learning-based inversion method more generalizable for realistic engineering applications, this work proposes a residual fully convolutional network (Res-FCN) to perform EM inversion of high contrast scatterers at an arbitrary frequency within a wide frequency band. The proposed Res-FCN combines the advantages of the Res-Net and the fully convolutional network (FCN). Res-FCN consists of an encoder and a decoder: the encoder is employed to extract high-dimensional features from the measured scattered field through the residual frameworks, while the decoder is employed to map from the high-dimensional features extracted by the encoder to the electrical parameter distribution in the inversion region by the up-sample layer and the residual frameworks. Four numerical examples verify that the proposed Res-FCN can achieve good performance in the 2-D EM inversion problem for high contrast scatterers with anti-noise ability at an arbitrary frequency point within a wide frequency band.

    "abstract": "Opals are naturally occurring photonic crystals which can be formed easily using low-cost self-assembly methods. While the optical behaviour of opals has received significant attention over the last number of decades, there is limited information on the effect of crystal thickness on the optical properties they display. Here, the relationship between volume fraction and crystal thickness is established with an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method of formation. The extent to which thickness can be used to manipulate the optical properties of the crystals is explored, focusing on the change in the photonic band gap (PBG). Microscopical structural characterization and angle-resolved transmission spectroscopy are used to examine the quality of the photonic crystals formed using different volume fractions of polystyrene spheres, with thicknesses up to 37 layers grown from volume fractions of 0.125%. This work provides a direct correlation between sphere solution volume fraction and crystal thickness, and the associated optical fingerprint of opal photonic crystals. Maximum thickness is examined, which is shown to converge to a narrow range over several evaporation rates. We identify the criteria required to achieve thickness control in relatively fast evaporation induced self-assembly while maintaining structural quality, and the change to the spectroscopic signature to the (111) stopband and higher order (220) reflections, under conditions where a less ordered photonic crystals are formed.

    "abstract": "Innovative new materials are consistently emerging as electrode candidates from lithium-ion battery research, promising high energy densities and high-rate capabilities. Understanding potential structural changes, morphology evolution, degradation mechanisms and side reactions during lithiation is important for designing, optimising and assessing aspiring electrode materials. In-situ and operando analysis techniques provide a means to investigate these material properties under realistic operating conditions. Here, we demonstrate an operando spectroscopic method using photonic crystal-structured electrodes that uses the optical transmission spectrum to monitor changes to the state of charge or discharge during lithiation and the change to electrode structure, in real-time. Photonic crystals possess a signature optical response, with a photonic bandgap (or stopband) presenting as a structural colour reflection from the material. We leverage the presence of this photonic stopband, alongside its intricate relationship to the electrode structure and material phase, to correlate electrode lithiation with changes to the optical spectrum during operation. In this work, we explore the optical and electrochemical behaviour of a TiO2 anode in a lithium-ion battery, structured as an inverse opal photonic crystal. In principle, the operando technique demonstrated here is versatile and applicable to a wide range of electrochemical electrode material candidates when structured with ordered porosity akin to a photonic crystal structure.

    "abstract": "We present the simultaneous optical and thermal analysis of a freestanding photonic semiconductor membrane made from wurtzite III-nitride material. By linking micro-photoluminescence ($\\mu$PL) spectroscopy with Raman thermometry, we demonstrate how a robust value for the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ can be obtained using only optical, non-invasive means. For this, we consider the balance of different contributions to thermal transport given by, e.g., excitons, charge carriers, and heat carrying phonons. Further complication is given by the fact that this membrane is made from direct bandgap semiconductors, designed to emit light based on an In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N ($x=0.15$) quantum well embedded in GaN. To meet these challenges, we designed a novel experimental setup that enables the necessary optical and thermal characterizations in parallel. We perform micro-Raman thermometry, either based on a heating laser that acts as a probe laser (1-laser Raman thermometry), or based on two lasers, providing the heating and the temperature probe separately (2-laser Raman thermometry). For the latter technique, we obtain temperature maps over tens of micrometers with a spatial resolution less than $1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, yielding $\\kappa\\,=\\,95^{+11}_{-7}\\,\\frac{\\text{W}}{\\text{m}\\cdot \\text{K}}$ for the $\\textit{c}$-plane of our $\\approx\\,250\\text{-nm}$-thick membrane at around room temperature, which compares well to our $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculations applied to a simplified structure. Based on these calculations, we explain the particular relevance of the temperature probe volume, as quasi-ballistic transport of heat-carrying phonons occurs on length scales beyond the penetration depths of the heating laser and even its focus spot radius. The present work represents a significant step towards non-invasive, highly spatially resolved, and still quantitative thermometry performed on a photonic membrane. ",

The heating is assumed to be spherically symmetric, and the effects of particle vibrations, sound scattering, and acoustic microstreaming are included in the calculations of the acoustic radiation force. It is found that changes in the speed of sound of the fluid due to temperature gradients can significantly change the force on the particle, particularly through perturbations to the microstreaming pattern surrounding the particle. For some fluid-solid combinations, the effects of particle heating even reverse the direction of the force on the particle for a temperature increase at the particle surface as small as 1 K. ",

This research demonstrates that performing optical force calculations on periodic structures using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method is typically on the order of 10 times faster than FDTD with sufficient accuracy to suit optical design purposes.

In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines metasurface optics with optofluidics-enabled active transport of extracellular vesicles (EVs). By leveraging this combination, we show that we can rapidly capture EVs and detect their adsorption through a color change generated by a specially designed optical metasurface that produces structural colors. Our results demonstrate that the integration of optofluidics and metasurface optics enables robust colorimetric read-out for EV concentrations as low as 107 EVs/ml, achieved within a short incubation time of two minutes, while using a CCD camera or naked eye for the read-out. This approach offers the potential for rapid sensing without the need for spectrometers and provides a short response time. Our findings suggest that the synergy between optofluidics and metasurface platforms can enhance the detection efficiency of low concentration bioparticle samples by overcoming the diffusion limits.

We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where pairing order increases with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order varies with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors of the maximal pairing order. Our microscopic analysis further identifies short-range copper spin fluctuations, together with multi-orbital charge fluctuations, as central to the pairing trends.

Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) in particular have demonstrated an ability to generate highly accurate ansatz wave-functions using compact quantum circuits. However, the practical implementation of these methods on current quantum processing units (QPUs) faces significant challenges: the requirement to measure a polynomially scaling number of observables during the operator selection step, followed by the need to optimize a high-dimensional, noisy cost-function. In this study, we introduce new techniques to overcome these difficulties and execute hybrid adaptive algorithms on a 25-qubit error-mitigated quantum hardware coupled to a high performance GPU-accelerated quantum simulator. As a physics application, we compute the ground state of a 25-body Ising model using a novel greedy ADAPT-VQE procedure that requires only five circuit measurements for each iteration, regardless of the number of qubits and the size of the operator pool. As a chemistry application, we combine this greedy approach with the Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm to approximate the ground state of a molecular system. The successful implementation of these hybrid QPU/simulator computations enhances the applicability of adaptive VQE algorithms on QPUs and instills further optimism regarding the near-term advantages of quantum computing.
