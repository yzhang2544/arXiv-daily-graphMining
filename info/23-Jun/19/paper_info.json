    "title": "Automated, Consistent, and Even-handed Selection of Active Orbital  Spaces for Quantum Embedding",
    "abstract": "A widely used strategy to reduce the computational cost in quantum-chemical calculations is to partition the system into an active subsystem, which is the focus of the computational efforts and an environment that is treated at a lower computational level. The system partitioning is mostly based on localized molecular orbitals. When reaction paths or energy differences are to be calculated, it is crucial to keep the orbital space consistent for all structures. Inconsistencies in the orbital space can lead to unpredictable errors in the potential energy surface. While successful strategies to ensure this consistency have been established for organic and even metal-organic systems, these methods often fail for metal clusters or nanoparticles with a high density of near-degenerate and delocalized molecular orbitals. However, such systems are highly relevant for catalysis. Accurate yet feasible quantum-mechanical ab initio calculations are therefore highly desired. In this work, we present an approach based on the SPADE algorithm that allows us to ensure an automated and consistent partitioning even for systems with delocalized and near-degenerate molecular orbitals and demonstrate the validity of this method for the binding energies of small molecules on transition-metal clusters.

    "title": "Pressure-Induced Detour of Li$^+$ Transport during Large-Scale  Electroplating of Lithium in High-Energy Lithium Metal Pouch Cells",
    "abstract": "Externally applied pressure impacts the performance of batteries particularly in those undergoing large volume changes, such as lithium metal batteries. In particular, the Li$^+$ electroplating process in large format pouch cells occurs at a larger dimension compared to those in smaller lab-scale cells. A fundamental linkage between external pressure and large format electroplating of Li$^+$ remains missing but yet critically needed to understand the electrochemical behavior of Li$^+$ in practical batteries. Herein, this work utilizes 350 Wh/kg lithium metal pouch cell as a model system to study the electroplating of Li$^+$ ions and the impact of external pressure. The vertically applied uniaxial pressure on the batteries using liquid electrolyte profoundly affects the electroplating process of Li$^+$ which is well reflected by the self-generated pressures in the cell and can be correlated to battery cycling stability. Taking advantage of both constant gap and pressure application, all Li metal pouch cells demonstrated minimum swelling of 6-8% after 300 cycles, comparable to that of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Along the horizontal directions, the pressure distributed across the surface of Li metal pouch cell reveals a unique phenomenon of Li$^+$ migration during the electroplating (charge) process driven by an uneven distribution of external pressure across the large electrode area, leading to a preferred Li plating in the center area of Li metal anode. This work addresses a longstanding question and provides new fundamental insights on large format electrochemical plating of Li which will inspire more innovations and lead to homogeneous deposition of Li to advance rechargeable lithium metal battery technology.

    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs are pillars of precision spectroscopy, and their microresonator realization serves applications where miniaturization and large tooth separation are important. Microresonator combs cover an enormous range of time scales varying from the femtosecond periods of optical oscillations to milliseconds corresponding to the kilohertz linewidth of the comb teeth. Here, we develop and implement the carrier-resolved real-field model for multi-octave frequency combs, which allows for nearly ab initio capture of all the time scales involved. As an example, we consider a microresonator that has a mix of second- and third-order nonlinearities and uses periodic poling. By applying the real-field approach, we demonstrate how to surpass traditional limitations and model the spectral broadening and soliton mode-locking across three optical octaves. ",

While numerous quantum chemistry datasets focus on chemical properties and atomic forces, the ability to achieve accurate and efficient prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix is highly desired, as it is the most important and fundamental physical quantity that determines the quantum states of physical systems and chemical properties. In this work, we generate a new Quantum Hamiltonian dataset, named as QH9, to provide precise Hamiltonian matrices for 2,399 molecular dynamics trajectories and 130,831 stable molecular geometries, based on the QM9 dataset. By designing benchmark tasks with various molecules, we show that current machine learning models have the capacity to predict Hamiltonian matrices for arbitrary molecules. Both the QH9 dataset and the baseline models are provided to the community through an open-source benchmark, which can be highly valuable for developing machine learning methods and accelerating molecular and materials design for scientific and technological applications.

The conventional approach is to extrapolate far-resonance dynamics to near-resonance, but difficulty arises because the nonlinear detuning parameter diverges at this critical point. Here we derive, via a suitable application of the canonical perturbation theory, a revised detuning parameter that is well-behaved near resonance. The resultant theory accurately describes the morphology of transverse resonance island buckets (TRIBs) for a wide range of parameter space. Our results have important implications for advanced applications of storage rings, as well as for the underlying physics of resonant particle dynamics. ",

Coarse energy resolution was obtained using aluminum filters of several thicknesses to block lower-energy electrons. A threshold intensity around $2 \\times 10^{20}$ W/cm$^{2}$ is observed for production of energetic ATI electrons in the laser forward direction, with maximum electron energy exceeding 10 MeV.

Here, we study the topological properties of momentum bandgap in one-dimensional (1D) PT-symmetric photonic crystals (PCs).k*p analysis shows that reversing the system's non-Hermiticity would lead to a topological phase transition, which is manifested as a local geometric phase along the momentum band.As a consequence of such geometric phase, a temporal boundary state (TBS) exists in the middle of momentum gap.

    "title": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Quantification Aided by Deep Estimations  of Imperfection Factors and Overall Macromolecular Signal",
    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an important non-invasive technique for in vivo biomedical detection. However, it is still challenging to accurately quantify metabolites with proton MRS due to three problems: Serious overlaps of metabolite signals, signal distortions due to non-ideal acquisition conditions and interference with strong background signals including macromolecule signals. The most popular software, LCModel, adopts the non-linear least square to quantify metabolites and addresses these problems by introducing regularization terms, imperfection factors of non-ideal acquisition conditions, and designing several empirical priors such as basissets of both metabolites and macromolecules. However, solving such a large non-linear quantitative problem is complicated. Moreover, when the signal-to-noise ratio of an input MRS signal is low, the solution may have a large deviation. In this work, deep learning is introduced to reduce the complexity of solving this overall quantitative problem. Deep learning is designed to predict directly the imperfection factors and the overall signal from macromolecules. Then, the remaining part of the quantification problem becomes a much simpler effective fitting and is easily solved by Linear Least Squares (LLS), which greatly improves the generalization to unseen concentration of metabolites in the training data. Experimental results show that compared with LCModel, the proposed method has smaller quantification errors for 700 sets of simulated test data, and presents more stable quantification results for 20 sets of healthy in vivo data at a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio. Qnet also outperforms other deep learning methods in terms of lower quantification error on most metabolites. Finally, QNet has been deployed on a cloud computing platform, CloudBrain-MRS, which is open accessed at https://csrc.xmu.edu.cn/CloudBrain.html. ",

Our approach is based on magneto-optic probing of the Zeeman torque the terahertz magnetic field exerts on the magnetization of a ferromagnet. Using an 8 nm thick iron film as sensor, we detect pulses from a silicon-based spintronic terahertz emitter with bandwidth 0.1-11 THz and peak field >0.1 MV/cm. Static calibration provides access to absolute transient THz field strengths. We show relevant added values of ZTS compared to electro-optic sampling (EOS): an absolute and echo-free transfer function with simple frequency dependence, linearity even at high terahertz field amplitudes, the straightforward calibration of EOS response functions and the modulation of the polarization-sensitive direction by an external AC magnetic field. Consequently, ZTS has interesting applications even beyond the accurate characterization of broadband high-field terahertz pulses for nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. ",

Using spectroscopic ellipsometry in a spectral range from far infrared to far ultraviolet (0.045-8.5 eV), we determine $n$ and $k$ of ScN layers grown on Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) substrates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Fits of ellipsometry data return the energies of four oscillators representing critical points in the band structure of ScN, namely, 2.03, 3.89, 5.33, and 6.95 eV. As the infrared range is dominated by free carriers, the vibrational properties of the layers are examined by Raman spectroscopy. Despite the rocksalt structure of ScN, several first-order phonon modes are observed, suggesting a high density of point defects consistent with the high electron density deduced from Hall measurements. Finally, photoluminescence measurements reveal an emission band slightly above the lowest direct bandgap. We attribute the redshift of the peak emission energy from 2.3 to 2.2 eV with increasing layer thickness to a reduction of the O concentration in the layers. ",

We focus in particular on how molecular vibrational modes, thought to play an important role in photosynthetic exciton transport, impact the system-cavity behaviour in the Purcell regime. We provide a theoretical picture in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which extends the simple picture of a Jaynes-Cummings model to the description of a `multi-level' Purcell effect, where different levels have differing Purcell factors, with effective cooperativities mediated by coherent vibrational interactions.

However, due to the two-dimensional specificity of graphene, the presence of defects might induce stronger effects than in bulky noble metals. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of structural defects hosted by graphene on selected figures of merit associated to localized plasmons, which are of key technological importance for plasmon-based molecular sensing. By considering an optimized graphene nanostructure, we provide a comparative analysis intended to shed light on the impact of the type of defect on graphene localized plasmons, that regards distinct types of defects commonly arising from fabrication procedures or exposure to radiation.
