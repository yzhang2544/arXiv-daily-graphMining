    "abstract": "Time-delayed optical feedback is known to trigger a wide variety of complex dynamical behavior in semiconductor lasers. Adding a second optical feedback loop is naturally expected to further increase the complexity of the system and its dynamics, but due to interference between the two feedback arms it was also quickly identified as a way to improve the laser stability. While these two aspects have already been investigated, the influence of the feedback phases, i.e. sub-wavelength changes in the mirror positions, on the laser behavior still remains to be thoroughly studied, despite indications that this parameter could have a significant impact. Here, we analyze the effect of the feedback phase on the laser stability in a dual-feedback configuration. We show an increased sensitivity of the laser system to feedback phase changes when two feedback loops are present, and clarify the interplay between the frequency shift induced by the feedback and the interferometric effect between the two feedback arms.

One of the pursuing goals of mode division (de)multiplexer is how to realize such devices with larger bandwidth and better fabrication tolerance.

In this work, we experimentally realize a broadband mode division demultiplexing device with a high degree of fabrication tolerance based on lithium niobate-on-insulator waveguide array. By taking advantage of the fact that different modes in the waveguide array have different group velocity, we experimentally confirmed that different modes in the waveguide array have different transverse displacements. The implementation of the integrated broadband mode division demultiplexer may have future applications in information processing technology, quantum communication as well as quantum computing. ",

    "abstract": "Fiber optic sensing is becoming an important means to physically secure today's network infrastructure. However, a network-wide deployment of the monitors will require cost reduction of the interrogator system, which can only be achieved by highly integrated system components. In this contribution, we report on the use of an in-house designed single-chip coherent transceiver for acoustic fiber sensing. The transceiver on the basis of silicon photonics contains a high-speed dual-polarization IQ-modulator as well as a coherent receiver with balanced photodiodes and trans-impedance amplifiers, as defined by the OIF integrated coherent transmit-receive optical sub assembly (IC-TROSA) implementation agreement. The laser, used for transmission and as local oscillator, is provided external to the photonic integrated circuit and can be chosen according to the line-width requirements of the sensing system. The acoustic sensing demonstration is using a correlation-based optical time domain reflectometry with coherent detection. This method is able to detect, besides the amplitude information, the phase of the back-scattered signal, which has a significantly higher sensitivity to environmental effects on the fiber, like temperature and strain. As a proof of concept, sensing of an acoustic signal after a fiber span of 20 km is demonstrated by evaluating the obtained phase information, providing information on external dynamic events up to a frequency of 1.75 kHz.

An experiment was conducted in Lake Zurich, where a fiber-optic cable and a self-made hydrophone array were deployed.

Analysis revealed distinct frequency responses in the DAS channels and provided insights into sound propagation in the lake. Challenges related to cable sensitivity, sample rate, and broadcast fidelity were identified.

In this paper, we propose a novel principled approach to the MEG sensor-array optimization problem. We use the Vector Spherical Harmonics (VSH) formalism to define a figure-of-merit for an MEG sensor array. We start with an observation that, under certain reasonable assumptions, any array of $m$ perfectly noiseless sensors will attain exactly the same performance, regardless of the sensors' locations and orientations (with the exception of a negligible set of singularly bad sensor configurations). We proceed to the conclusion that under the aforementioned assumptions, the only difference between different array configurations is the effect of (sensor) noise on their performance. We then propose a figure-of-merit that quantifies, with a single number, how much the sensor array in question amplifies the sensor noise. With the figure-of-merit defined, we can formulate the sensor array design problem as a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, amenable to general-purpose optimization methods, such as simulated annealing, basin hopping, etc. We demonstrate the proposed approach by generating optimized sensor arrays that can measure neuromagnetic fields in the presence of environmental noise more accurately than typical MEG sensor configurations.

From the perspective of on-chip integration and reconfigurability of photonic neural network (PNN), it is highly preferred that a single compact device can fulfill multiple NAFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact high-speed microdisk modulator to realize multiple NAFs. The fabricated microdisk modulator has an add-drop configuration in which a lateral PN junction is incorporated for tuning. Based on high-speed nonlinear electrical-optical (E-O) effect, multiple NAFs are realized by electrically controlling free-carrier injection. Thanks to its strong optical confinement of the disk cavity, all-optical thermo-optic (TO) nonlinear effect can also be leveraged to realize other four different NAFs, which is difficult to be realized with the use of electrical-optical effect. With the use of the realized nonlinear activation function, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is studied to perform handwritten digit classification task, and an accuracy as large as 98% is demonstrated, which verifies the effectiveness of the use of the high-speed microdisk modulator to realize the NAFs.

The first cavity interacts with a ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere providing the magnon-photon coupling. Under passive cavities configuration, the system displays high absorption, prohibiting output transmission even though the dispersive response is anamolous. We replace the second passive cavity with an active one to overcome high absorption, producing an effective gain in the system. We show that the deformation of the YIG sphere retains the anomalous dispersion. Further, tuning the exchange interaction strength between the two resonators leads to the system's effective gain and dispersive response. As a result, the advancement associated with the amplification of the probe pulse can be controlled in the close vicinity of the magnomechanical resonance. Furthermore, we find the existence of an upper bound for the intensity amplification and the advancement of the probe pulse that comes from the stability condition. These findings may find potential applications for controlling light propagation in cavity magnomechanics. ",

Our approach relies on a silicon-photonics front-end to compress raw image data, foregoing energy-intensive image conditioning and reducing data storage requirements. The compression scheme uses a passive disordered photonic structure to perform kernel-type random projections of the raw image data with minimal power consumption and low latency. A back-end neural network can then reconstruct the original images with structural similarity exceeding 90%.

    "title": "Nuclear Spin-Depleted, Isotopically Enriched  $^\\text{70}$Ge/$^\\text{28}$Si$^\\text{70}$Ge Quantum Wells",
    "abstract": "The p-symmetry of the hole wavefunction is associated with a weaker hyperfine interaction as compared to electrons, thus making hole spin qubits attractive candidates to implement long coherence quantum processors. However, recent studies demonstrated that hole qubits in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures are still very sensitive to nuclear spin bath. These observations highlight the need to develop nuclear spin-free Ge qubits to suppress this decoherence channel and evaluate its impact. With this perspective, this work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of $^\\text{73}$Ge-depleted isotopically enriched $^\\text{70}$Ge/SiGe quantum wells. The growth was achieved by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition using isotopically purified monogermane $^\\text{70}$GeH$_\\text{4}$ and monosilane $^\\text{28}$SiH$_\\text{4}$ with an isotopic purity higher than 99.9 $\\%$ and 99.99 $\\%$, respectively. The quantum wells consist of a series of $^\\text{70}$Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Si wafers using a Ge virtual substrate and a graded SiGe buffer layer. The isotopic purity is investigated using atom probe tomography following an analytical procedure addressing the discrepancies in the isotopic content caused by the overlap of isotope peaks in mass spectra. The nuclear spin background in the quantum wells was found to be sensitive to the growth conditions. The lowest concentration of nuclear spin-full isotopes $^\\text{73}$Ge and $^\\text{29}$Si in the heterostructure was established at 0.01 $\\%$ in the Ge quantum well and SiGe barriers. The measured average distance between nuclear spins reaches 3-4 nm in $^\\text{70}$Ge/$^\\text{28}$Si$^\\text{70}$Ge, which is an order of magnitude larger than in natural Ge/SiGe heterostructures.

    "abstract": "The Mott insulator and superfluid phase transition is one of the most prominent phenomena in ultracold atoms. In this work, we report the observation of a novel 2D quantum phase transition between Mott insulator and $\\pi$ superfluid in a shaking optical lattice. In the deep optical lattice regime, the lowest $s$-band can be tuned to Mott phase, while the higher $p_{x,y}$ bands are itinerant for having larger bandwidth. Through a shaking technique coupling the $s$ orbital to $p_{x,y}$ orbital states, we experimentally observe the transition between the states of the $s$ and $p_{x,y}$ bands, leading to a quantum phase transition from 2D $s$-orbital Mott phase to the $p_{x,y}$-orbital superfluid which condensed at $(\\pi,\\pi)$ momentum.
