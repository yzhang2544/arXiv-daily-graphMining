The density of the Lagrangian for the system turns out to be equal to the invariant of the electromagnetic field tensor, vanishing four-divergence of canonical four-momentum appears to be consequence of the Poyinting theorem, and explicit form of one of gauges of the electromagnetic four-potential was introduced. A quantum picture of the system was also proposed, leading to the Klein-Gordon equation, which seems to finally reconcile the curvilinear description, classic relativistic description and quantum description of the physical system.

    "abstract": "Event centric approaches to modeling physics have gained traction in recent decades. In this work, we present a first principles approach to this idea, which assumes nothing but the existence of causal networks of events and their relationships. The modeling elements we employ consist solely of classical bits, or the abstract symbols $0$ and $1$. Using sequences of these symbols, we model primitive elements of causal networks consisting of two causally connected events. By introducing an epistemic constraint on observers, we derive a statistical picture of these network elements, leading to the emergence of non-determinism and the subsequent derivation of a quantum theory. We then apply this event centric framework to three physical scenarios involving spin, including a Bell test. Comparing the resulting predictions to non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we find good agreement, including a violation of the CHSH inequality. More broadly, the results presented here highlight this novel framework's explanatory and predictive power. When coupled with recent advancements in event centric approaches to modeling spacetime, we argue that this framework may provide some insight into the issue of quantum gravity. ",

    "abstract": "Measurement uncertainty is an important topic in the undergraduate laboratory curriculum. Previous research on student thinking about experimental measurement uncertainty has focused primarily on introductory-level students' procedural reasoning about data collection and interpretation. In this paper, we extended this prior work to study upper-level students' thinking about sources of measurement uncertainty across experimental contexts, with a particular focus on classical and quantum mechanics contexts. We developed a survey to probe students' thinking in the generic question ``What comes to mind when you think about measurement uncertainty in [classical/quantum] mechanics?'' as well as in a range of specific experimental scenarios. We found that students primarily focused on limitations of the experimental setup in classical mechanics and principles of the underlying physics theory in quantum mechanics. Our results suggest that students need careful scaffolding to identify principles in appropriate classical experimental contexts and limitations in appropriate quantum experimental contexts. We recommend that future research probe how instruction in both classical and quantum contexts can help students better understand the range of sources of uncertainty present in classical and quantum experiments.

    "abstract": "Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is commonly used to prevent or treat keratoconus. Although changes in corneal stiffness induced by CXL surgery can be monitored with non-contact dynamic optical coherence elastography (OCE) by tracking mechanical wave propagation, depth dependent changes are still unclear if the cornea is not crosslinked through the whole depth. Here, phase-decorrelation measurements on optical coherence tomography (OCT) structural images are combined with acoustic micro-tapping (A$\\mu$T) OCE to explore possible reconstruction of depth-dependent stiffness within crosslinked corneas in an ex vivo human cornea sample. Experimental OCT images are analyzed to define the penetration depth of CXL into the cornea. In a representative ex vivo human cornea sample, crosslinking depth varied from $\\sim 100\\mu m$ in the periphery to $\\sim 150\\mu m$ in the cornea center and exhibited a sharp in-depth transition between crosslinked and untreated areas. This information was used in an analytical two-layer guided wave propagation model to quantify the stiffness of the treated layer. We also discuss how the elastic moduli of partially CXL-treated cornea layers reflect the effective engineering stiffness of the entire cornea to properly quantify corneal deformation. ",

The generation of FM combs relies on spatial hole burning, group velocity dispersion (GVD), Kerr nonlinearity, and four-wave mixing (FWM). While FM combs have been widely observed in quantum cascade Fabry-Perot (FP) lasers, the requirement for a low-dispersion FP cavity can be a challenge in platforms where the waveguide dispersion is mainly determined by the material. Here we report a 60 GHz quantum-dot (QD) mode-locked laser in which both the amplitude-modulated (AM) and the FM comb can be generated independently. The high FWM efficiency of -5 dB allows the QD laser to generate an FM comb efficiently. We also demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity can be practically engineered to improve the FM comb bandwidth without the need for GVD engineering. The maximum 3-dB bandwidth that our QD platform can deliver is as large as 2.2 THz. This study gives novel insights into the improvement of FM combs and paves the way for small-footprint, electrically-pumped, and energy-efficient frequency combs for silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

Our results show that the nonlocal plasmon damping effects in single nanoparticles are less significant compared to those observed in plasmon-coupled systems.

    "abstract": "An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is a time delay oscillator (TDO) that uses photonics technology to provide the long delay required to generate pristine microwave carriers. Parity-time (PT) symmetry concepts applied to an OEO offer the potential to achieve combined low phase noise and high sidemode suppression. A TDO composed of a pair of identical ring resonators coupled by a 2x2 coupler is modelled, and the coupler transmission matrix required for the oscillator to be PT- symmetric is derived. In a first configuration, the coupler is interpreted as the composition of a gain/loss block and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) block. In practice, there are excess losses that must be compensated by a special dual amplifier with saturation characteristics compatible with PT- symmetry. The PT- symmetry phase transition determined by the gain/loss and the MZI differential phase parameters is found to be global and not local in its effect on modes. This is resolved by placing a short delay line within one arm of the MZI resulting in a frequency dependent and hence local mode-selective PT- symmetry phase transition. In addition, it is demonstrated that the first configuration may be transformed into a second but equivalent configuration as a cross-injection dual TDO with imbalanced delays. The local PT- symmetry phase transition may then be understood in terms of the Vernier effect. Advantageously, the second configuration enables the special dual amplifier to be replaced by a pair of matched but otherwise independent amplifiers. Thereby, the second configuration is amenable to practical implementation as a dual OEO using standard RF-photonic and RF-electronic components. The theory is validated by complex envelope model simulations using Simulink and phase model analytic results evaluated using MATLAB. There is excellent agreement between the theoretical and simulation results. ",

Here, we propose using direct-product wave functions as trials for MSD-AFQMC, aiming to reduce computational overhead by leveraging the compactness of multi-Slater determinant trials in direct-product form (DP-MSD). This efficiency arises when the active space can be divided into non-coupling subspaces, a condition we term \"decomposable active space\". By employing localized-active space self-consistent field wave functions as an example of such trials, we demonstrate our proposed approach in various molecular systems. Our findings indicate that the compact DP-MSD trials can reduce computational costs substantially, by up to 36 times for the \\ce{C2H6N4} molecule where the two double bonds between nitrogen \\ce{N=N} are clearly separated by a \\ce{C-C} single bond, while maintaining accuracy when active spaces are decomposable. However, for systems where these active subspaces strongly couple, a scenario we refer to as \"strong subspace coupling\", the method's accuracy decreases compared to that achieved with a complete active space approach. We anticipate that our method will be beneficial for systems with non-coupling to weakly-coupling subspaces that require local multireference treatments. ",

In particular, negatively charged group-IV color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum memories, as they combine long storage times with excellent optical emission properties and an optically-addressable spin state. However, as a material, diamond lacks many functionalities needed to realize scalable quantum systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), in contrast, offers a number of useful photonic nonlinearities, including the electro-optic effect, piezoelectricity, and capabilities for periodically-poled quasi-phase matching. Here, we present highly efficient heterogeneous integration of diamond nanobeams containing negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers with TFLN waveguides. We observe greater than 90\\% transmission efficiency between the diamond nanobeam and TFLN waveguide on average across multiple measurements. By comparing saturation signal levels between confocal and integrated collection, we determine a $10$-fold increase in photon counts channeled into TFLN waveguides versus that into out-of-plane collection channels. Our results constitute a key step for creating scalable integrated quantum photonic circuits that leverage the advantages of both diamond and TFLN materials. ",

Atoms, solid-state excitons and excitons coupled to light all exhibit BEC, which results in high coherence due to massive occupation of the respective system's ground state. Surprisingly, photons were shown to exhibit BEC much more recently in organic dye-filled optical microcavities, which, owing to the photon's low mass, occurs at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that photons within an inorganic semiconductor microcavity also thermalise and undergo BEC. Although semiconductor lasers are understood to operate out of thermal equilibrium, we identify a region of good thermalisation in our system where we can clearly distinguish laser action from BEC. Based on well-developed technology, semiconductor microcavities are a robust system for exploring the physics and applications of quantum statistical photon condensates. Notably, photon BEC is an alternative to exciton-based BECs, which dissociate under high excitation and often require cryogenic operating conditions. In practical terms, photon BECs offer their critical behaviour at lower thresholds than lasers. Our study shows two further advantages of photon BEC in semiconductor materials: the lack of dark electronic states allows these BECs to be sustained continuously; and semiconductor quantum wells offer strong photon-photon scattering. We measure an unoptimised interaction parameter, $\\tilde{g}=0.0023\\pm0.0003$, which is large enough to access the rich physics of interactions within BECs, such as superfluid light or vortex formation.

Both macroscopic ($I$--$V$, $C$--$V$) and microscopic (Thermally Stimulated Current~(TSC)) measurements were conducted to characterize the radiation-induced changes. The investigated diodes were manufactured on high resistivity $p$-type Float Zone (FZ) silicon and were further classified into two types based on the isolation technique between the pad and guard ring: $p$-stop and $p$-spray. After irradiation, the macroscopic results of current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements were obtained and compared with existing literature data.

Recent advances have revealed that symmetry breaking in piezoelectric metamaterials introduces an additional macroscopic cross-coupling effect, termed electromomentum coupling, linking electrical stimulus and momentum and enabling the emergence of exotic wave phenomena characteristic of Willis materials. The electro-momentum coupling provides an extra degree of freedom for controlling elastic wave propagation in piezoelectric composites through external electrical stimuli. In this study, we present how to tune the electro-momentum coupling arising in 1-D periodic piezoelectric metamaterials with broken inversion symmetry through shunting the inherent capacitance of the individual piezoelectric layers with a resistor and inductor in series forming an RLC (resistor-inductor-capacitor) circuit. Guided by the effective elastodynamic theory and homogenization method for piezoelectric metamaterials, we derived a closed-form expression of the electro-momentum coupling in shunted piezoelectric metamaterials. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to tailor the electro-momentum coupling coefficient and control the amplitudes and phases of the forward and backward propagating waves, yielding tunable asymmetric wave responses.

    "abstract": "Silicon photonic ring resonator thermometers have been shown to provide temperature measurements with a 10 mK accuracy. In this work we identify and quantify the intrinsic on-chip impairments that may limit further improvement in temperature measurement accuracy. The impairments arise from optically induced changes in the waveguide effective index, and from back-reflections and scattering at defects and interfaces inside the ring cavity and along the path between light source and detector. These impairments are characterized for 220 x 500 nm Si waveguide rings by experimental measurement in a calibrated temperature bath and by phenomenological models of ring response. At different optical power levels both positive and negative light induced resonance shifts are observed. For a ring with L = 100 um cavity length, the self-heating induced resonance red shift can alter the temperature reading by 200 mK at 1 mW incident power, while a small blue shift is observed below 100 uW. The effect of self-heating is shown to be effectively suppressed by choosing longer ring cavities. Scattering and back-reflections often produce split and distorted resonance line shapes. Although these distortions can vary with resonance order, they are almost completely invariant with temperature for a given resonance and do not lead to measurement errors in themselves. The effect of line shape distortions can largely be mitigated by tracking only selected resonance orders with negligible shape distortion, and by measuring the resonance minimum wavelength directly, rather than attempting to fit the entire resonance line shape. The results demonstrate the temperature error due to these impairments can be limited to below the 3 mK level through appropriate design choices and measurement procedures. ",

    "abstract": "Cavity optomechanics aims to establish optical control over vibrations of mechanical systems, to heat, cool or to drive them toward coherent, or nonclassical states. This field was recently extended to include molecular optomechanics, which describes the dynamics of THz molecular vibrations coupled to the optical fields of lossy cavities via Raman transitions, and was developed to understand the anomalous amplification of optical phonons in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering experiments. But the molecular platform should prove suitable for demonstrating more sophisticated optomechanical effects, including engineering of nonclassical mechanical states, or inducing coherent molecular vibrations. In this work, we propose two pathways towards implementing these effects, enabled or revealed by the strong intrinsic anharmonicities of molecular vibrations. First, to prepare a nonclassical mechanical state, we propose an incoherent analogue of the mechanical blockade, in which the molecular aharmonicity and optical response of hybrid cavities isolate the two lowest-energy vibrational states. Secondly, we show that for a strongly driven optomechanical system, the anharmonicity can effectively suppress the mechanical amplification, shifting and reshaping the onset of coherent mechanical oscillations. Our estimates indicate that both effects should be within reach of the existing implementations of the Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering, opening the pathway towards the coherent and nonclassical effects in molecular optomechanics.

    "abstract": "The capability to reach ultracold atomic temperatures in compact instruments has recently been extended into space. Ultracold temperatures amplify quantum effects, while free-fall allows further cooling and longer interactions time with gravity - the final force without a quantum description. On Earth, these devices have produced macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BECs), superfluidity, and strongly interacting quantum gases. Quantum sensors interfering the superposition of two ultracold atomic isotopes have tested the Universality of Free Fall (UFF), a core tenet of Einstein's classical gravitational theory, at the $10^{-12}$ level. In space, cooling the elements needed to explore the rich physics of strong interactions and preparing the multiple species required for quantum tests of the UFF has remained elusive. Here, utilizing upgraded capabilities of the multi-user Cold Atom Lab (CAL) instrument within the International Space Station (ISS), we report the first simultaneous production of a dual species Bose-Einstein condensate in space (formed from $^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K), observation of interspecies interactions, as well as the production of $^{39}$K ultracold gases. We have further achieved the first space-borne demonstration of simultaneous atom interferometry with two atomic species ($^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K). These results are an important step towards quantum tests of UFF in space, and will allow scientists to investigate aspects of few-body physics, quantum chemistry, and fundamental physics in novel regimes without the perturbing asymmetry of gravity.

    "abstract": "We obtain universal (i.e., probe and measurement-independent) performance bounds on ancilla-assisted quantum sensing of multiple parameters of phase-covariant optical channels under energy and mode-number constraints. We first show that for any such constrained problem, an optimal ancilla-entangled probe can always be found whose reduced state on the modes probing the channel is diagonal in the photon-number basis. For parameters that are encoded in single-mode Gaussian channels, we derive a universal upper bound on the quantum Fisher information matrix that delineates the roles played by the energy and mode constraints. We illustrate our results for sensing of the transmittance of a thermal loss channel under both the no-passive-signature and passive-signature paradigms, and in the problem of sensing the noise variance of an additive-noise channel. In both cases, we show that two-mode squeezed vacuum probes are near-optimal under the constraints in the regime of low signal brightness, i.e., per-mode average photon number. More generally, our work sets down a uniform framework for readily evaluating universal limits for any sensing problem involving Gaussian channels. ",

    "abstract": "Tantalum thin films sputtered on unheated silicon substrates are characterized with microwaves at around 10 GHz in a 10 mK environment. We show that the phase of tantalum with a body-centered cubic lattice ($\\alpha$-Ta) can be grown selectively by depositing a niobium buffer layer prior to a tantalum film. The physical properties of the films, such as superconducting transition temperature and crystallinity, change markedly with the addition of the buffer layer. Coplanar waveguide resonators based on the composite film exhibit significantly enhanced internal quality factors compared with a film without the buffer layer. The internal quality factor approaches $2\\times 10^7$ at a large-photon-number limit. While the quality factor decreases at the single-photon level owing to two-level system (TLS) loss, we have identified the primary cause of TLS loss to be the amorphous silicon layer at the film-substrate interface, which originates from the substrate cleaning before the film deposition rather than the film itself. The temperature dependence of the internal quality factors shows a marked rise below 200 mK, suggesting the presence of TLS-TLS interactions. The present low-loss tantalum films can be deposited without substrate heating and thus have various potential applications in superconducting quantum electronics. ",

ULTRASAT is a space mission led by the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Israel Space Agency and is planned for launch in 2025. The camera implements backside-illuminated, stitched pixel sensors. The pixel has a dual-conversion-gain 4T architecture, with a pitch of $9.5$ $\\mu m$ and is produced in a $180$ $nm$ process by Tower Semiconductor. Before the final sensor was available for testing, test sensors provided by Tower were used to gain first insights into the pixel's radiation tolerance. One of the main contributions to sensor degradation due to radiation for the ULTRASAT mission is Total Ionizing Dose (TID). TID measurements on the test sensors have been performed with a Co-60 gamma source at Helmholz Zentrum Berlin and CC-60 facility at CERN and preliminary results are presented. ",

    "abstract": "Statistical physics is important in understanding the physics of interacting many bodies. This has been historically developed by attempts to understand colliding gases and quantifying quantities like entropy, free energy, and other thermodynamic quantities. An important contribution in statistical physics was by Boltzmann in the form of the H-theorem, which considered collisions between particles and used the assumption of molecular chaos or Stosszahlansatz to understand macroscopic irreversibility. To elucidate these ideas, Mark Kac introduced a classical analog called Kac rings. In this work, we attempt to introduce quantum-ness in a Kac ring and study its entropy and recurrence, comparing and contrasting to corresponding trends in a classical Kac ring. We look at the trends of recurrence time for a system with a qubit as a pointer. We further study the time distribution of entropy for these systems. ",
