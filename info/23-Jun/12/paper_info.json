    "abstract": "Numerical implementation of an explicit phonon bath requires a large number of oscillator modes in order to maintain oscillators at the initial temperature when modeling energy relaxation processes. An additional thermalization algorithm may be useful in controlling the local temperature. In this paper we extend our previously proposed thermalization algorithm [M. Jaku\\v{c}ionis and D. Abramavi\\v{c}ius, Phys. Rev. A 103, 032202 (2021) ] to be used with the numerically exact multiple-Davydov-D2 trial wave function for simulation of relaxation dynamics and spectroscopic signals of open quantum systems using the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle. By applying it to the molecular aggregate model, we demonstrate how the thermalization approach significantly reduces the numerical cost of simulations by decreasing the number of oscillators needed to explicitly simulate the aggregate's environment fluctuations while maintaining correspondence to the exact population relaxation dynamics. Additionally, we show how the thermalization can be used to find the equilibrium state of the excited molecular aggregate, which is necessary for simulation of the fluorescence and other spectroscopic signals. The thermalization algorithm we present offers the possibility to investigate larger system-bath models than was previously possible using the multiple-Davydov-D2 trial wave function and local heating effects in molecular complexes.

    "title": "Redesigning spectroscopic sensors with programmable photonic circuits",
    "abstract": "Optical spectroscopic sensors are a powerful tool to reveal light-matter interactions in many fields, such as physics, biology, chemistry, and astronomy. Miniaturizing the currently bulky spectrometers has become imperative for the wide range of applications that demand in situ or even in vitro characterization systems, a field that is growing rapidly. Benchtop spectrometers are capable of offering superior resolution and spectral range, but at the expense of requiring a large size. In this paper, we propose a novel method that redesigns spectroscopic sensors via the use of programmable photonic circuits. Drawing from compressive sensing theory, we start by investigating the most ideal sampling matrix for a reconstructive spectrometer and reveal that a sufficiently large number of sampling channels is a prerequisite for both fine resolution and low reconstruction error. This number is, however, still considerably smaller than that of the reconstructed spectral pixels, benefitting from the nature of reconstruction algorithms. We then show that the cascading of a few engineered MZI elements can be readily programmed to create an exponentially scalable number of such sampling spectral responses over an ultra-broad bandwidth, allowing for ultra-high resolution down to single-digit picometers without incurring additional hardware costs. Experimentally, we implement an on-chip spectrometer with a fully-programmable 6-stage cascaded MZI structure and demonstrate a < 10 pm resolution with a > 200 nm bandwidth using only 729 sampling channels. This achieves a bandwidth-to-resolution ratio of over 20,000, which is, to our best knowledge, about one order of magnitude greater than any reported miniaturized spectrometers to date. We further illustrate that by employing dispersion-engineered waveguide components, the device bandwidth can be extended to over 400 nm. ",

    "abstract": "Seismic forward and inverse problems are significant research areas in geophysics. However, the time burden of traditional numerical methods hinders their applications in scenarios that require fast predictions. Machine learning-based methods also have limitations as retraining is required for every change in initial conditions. In this letter, we adopt deep operator network (DeepONet) to solve forward and inverse problems based on the Eikonal equation, respectively. DeepONet approximates the operator through two sub-networks, branch net and trunk net, which offers good generalization and flexibility. Different structures of DeepONets are proposed to respectively learn the operators in forward and inverse problems. We train the networks on different categories of datasets separately, so that they can deliver accurate predictions with different initial conditions for the specific velocity model. The numerical results demonstrate that DeepONet can not only predict the travel time fields with different sources for different velocity models, but also provide velocity models based on the observed travel time data.

    "abstract": "Since the turn of the century, metamaterials have gained a large amount of attention due to their potential for possessing highly nontrivial and exotic properties such as cloaking or perfect lensing. There has been a great push to create reliable mathematical models that accurately describe the required material composition. Here, we consider a quantum graph approach to metamaterial design. An infnite square periodic quantum graph, constructed from vertices and edges, acts as a paradigm for a 2D metamaterial. Wave transport occurs along the edges with vertices acting as scatterers modelling sub-wavelength resonant elements. These resonant elements are constructed with the help of fnite quantum graphs attached to each vertex of the lattice with customisable properties controlled by a unitary scattering matrix. The metamaterial properties are understood and engineered by manipulating the band diagram of the periodic structure. The engineered properties are then demonstrated in terms of the refection and transmission behaviour of Gaussian beam solutions at an interface between two diferent metamaterials. We extend this treatment to N layered metamaterials using the Transfer Matrix Method. We demonstrate both positive and negative refraction and beam steering. Our proposed quantum graph modelling technique is very fexible and can be easily adjusted making it an ideal design tool for creating metamaterials with exotic band diagram properties or testing promising multi-layer set ups and wave steering efects ",

Signal treatment of the analog waveforms, as well as reconstruction of digital position, time and charge information, is carried out off-chip. This contribution introduces the design of the sensor and readout system and presents performance results for various pixel designs achieved in recent test beam measurements with external tracking and timing reference detectors.

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy is of vital importance for understanding biological function. However most fluorescence experiments are only qualitative inasmuch as the absolute number of fluorescent particles can often not be determined. Additionally, conventional approaches to measuring fluorescence intensity cannot distinguish between two or more fluorophores that are excited and emit in the same spectral window, as only the total intensity in a spectral window can be obtained. Here we show that, by using photon number resolving experiments, we are able to determine the number of emitters and their probability of emission for a number of different species, all with the same measured spectral signature. We illustrate our ideas by showing the determination of the number of emitters per species and the probability of photon collection from that species, for one, two, and three otherwise unresolvable fluorophores. The convolution Binomial model is presented to model the counted photons emitted by multiple species. And then the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to match the measured photon counts to the expected convolution Binomial distribution function. In applying the EM algorithm, to leverage the problem of being trapped in a sub-optimal solution, the moment method is introduced in finding the initial guess of the EM algorithm. Additionally, the associated Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound is derived and compared with the simulation results. ",

Among the various high-quality sources, nanowire quantum dots can be efficiently coupled to optical waveguides because of their preferred emission direction along their growth direction.

In this work, we transfer a nanowire quantum dot on a bulk lithium niobate substrate and show that its emission can be dynamically tuned by acousto-optical coupling with surface acoustic waves. The purity of the single photon source is preserved during the strain modulation. We further demonstrate that the transduction is maintained even with a SiO2 encapsulation layer deposited on top of the nanowire acting as the cladding of a photonic circuit. Based on these experimental findings and numerical simulations, we introduce a device architecture consisting of a nanowire quantum dot efficiently coupled to a thin film lithium niobate rib waveguide and strain-tunable by surface acoustic waves.

In doing so we bring together different autoregressive states under a unified framework for machine learning-inspired ans\\\"atze. Our results provide insights into how the autoregressive construction influences the ability of a variational model to describe correlations in spin and fermionic lattice models, as well as ab initio electronic structure problems where the choice of representation affects accuracy. We conclude that, while enabling efficient and direct sampling, thus avoiding autocorrelation and loss of ergodicity issues in Metropolis sampling, the autoregressive construction materially constrains the expressivity of the model in many systems.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarization effects in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer to a cavity-Hartree equation. Consequently, each molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling to the dipoles of all other molecules. In the thermodynamic limit, the sum of all molecular dipoles constitutes the macroscopic polarization field and the self-consistency then accounts for the delicate back-action on its heterogeneous microscopic constituents. The here derived cavity-Hartree equations allow for a computationally efficient implementation in an ab-initio molecular dynamics setting. For a randomly oriented ensemble of slowly rotating model molecules, we observe a red shift of the cavity resonance due to the polarization field, which is in agreement with experiments. We then demonstrate that the back-action on the local polarization takes a non-negligible value in the thermodynamic limit and hence the collective vibrational strong coupling can modify individual molecular properties locally. This is not the case, however, for dilute atomic ensembles, where room temperature does not induce any disorder and local polarization effects are absent. Our findings suggest that the thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, e.g. modified chemical reactions, requires self-consistent treatment of the cavity induced polarization and the usually applied restrictions to the displacement field effects may be insufficient.
