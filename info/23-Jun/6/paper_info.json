    "abstract": "A laser pulse composed of a fundamental and properly phased second harmonic exhibits an asymmetric electric field that can drive a time-dependent current of photoionized electrons. The current produces an ultrashort burst of terahertz (THz) radiation. When driven by a conventional laser pulse, the THz radiation is emitted into a cone with an angle determined by the dispersion of the medium. Here we demonstrate that the programmable-velocity intensity peak of a spatiotemporally structured, two-color laser pulse can be used to control the emission angle, focal spot, and spectrum of the THz radiation. Of particular interest for applications, a structured pulse with a subluminal intensity peak can drive highly focusable, on-axis THz radiation. ",

This paper demonstrates the design of a functional and efficient beamforming metasurface in the burgeoning D-band (0.11-0.17~THz). In addition to achieving broadband operation (0.135-0.165~THz), this design is polarization-maintaining, diffraction limited, simple in design, exhibits 64.1\\% broadband efficiency (1.9 dB insertion loss) and 20\\% fractional bandwidth. Despite being formed by an array of highly dispersive resonators, the metasurface exhibits very low temporal dispersion, which avoids pulse reshaping and its consequent limitations on achievable data rate. The design and performance of the focusing reflector are presented followed by a group delay and group delay dispersion analysis revealing that a 2.83\\% temporal broadening of the pulse is observed at the focus.

Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs provide an attractive solution as a broadband, high-repetition-rate compact laser system in this context. However, its operation usually requires sophisticated pump laser control to initiate and stabilize the soliton microcombs, particularly in millimeter-sized ultrahigh-Q whispering-gallery resonators. Here, we realize a mechanically actuated soliton microcomb oscillator with a microwave repetition rate of 15 GHz. This enables direct soliton initiation, long-term stabilization, and fine tuning, where the operation now lifts the prerequisite pump laser tunability that must be relaxed if the technology is to be widely used outside the laboratory environment. We reveal the prospects for using this method with a wide range of applications that would benefit from mechanical soliton actuation such as optical clocks, spectral extension, and dual-comb spectroscopy.

To our knowledge, our experiments serve as the first demonstration of soliton microcombs in Q > 109 CaF$_2$ WGMRs. We observed soliton mode-locking and bidirectional switching of soliton numbers caused by the negative thermo-optic effects. Additionally, various soliton formation dynamics are shown, including breathing and vibrational solitons, which can be attributed to thermo-photomechanical oscillations. Thus, our results enrich the soliton generation platform and provide a reference for generating solitons from WGMRs that comprise other materials with negative thermo-optic effects. In the future, the ultrahigh quality factor of CaF$_2$ crystal cavities may enable the generation of sub-milliwatt-level broad-spectrum soliton combs. ",

Understanding the nonlinear acousto-hydrodynamics of SAWs with a regulated micro-scale liquid film is essential for acousto-microfluidics platforms, particularly aerosol generators. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of micro-cavitation in an MHz-frequency SAW aerosol generation platform, which is touted as a leap in aerosol technology with versatile application fields including biomolecule inhalation therapy, micro-chromatography and spectroscopy, olfactory displays, and material deposition. Using analysis methods with high temporal and spatial resolution, we demonstrate that SAWs stabilize spatially arranged liquid micro-domes atop the generator's surface. Our experiments show that these liquid domes become acoustic resonators with highly fluctuating pressure amplitudes that can even nucleate cavitation bubbles, as supported by analytical modeling. The observed fragmentation of liquid domes indicates the participation of three droplet generation mechanisms, including cavitation and capillary-wave instabilities. During aerosol generation, the cavitation bubbles contribute to the ejection of droplets from the liquid domes and also explain observed microstructural damage patterns on the chip surface eventually caused by cavitation-based erosion.

Traditionally, least square method (LSM) is used for this purpose. However, LSM cannot be directly applied for any practical arrays. In other words, LSM is not a general approach, and it should be mixed with other techniques to find the magnitude and phase of the excitation coefficients of each element of the under-studying arrays.

    "abstract": "Ultracold molecules, because of their rich internal structures and interactions, have been proposed as a promising platform for quantum science and precision measurement. Direct laser-cooling promises to be a rapid and efficient way to bring molecules to ultracold temperatures. For trapped molecules, laser-cooling to the quantum motional ground state remains an outstanding challenge. A technique capable of reaching the motional ground state is Raman sideband cooling, first demonstrated in trapped ions and atoms. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time Raman sideband cooling of molecules. Specifically, we demonstrate 3D Raman cooling for single CaF molecules trapped in an optical tweezer array, achieving average radial (axial) motional occupation as low as $\\bar{n}_r=0.27(7)$ ($\\bar{n}_z=7.0(10)$). Notably, we measure a 1D ground state fraction as high as 0.79(4), and a motional entropy per particle of $s = 4.9(3)$, the lowest reported for laser-cooled molecules to date. These lower temperatures could enable longer coherence times and higher fidelity molecular qubit gates desirable for quantum information processing and quantum simulation. With further improvements, Raman cooling could also be a new route towards molecular quantum degeneracy applicable to many laser-coolable molecular species including polyatomic ones. ",

MRI time series of the local particle density and velocity were acquired and used to study the size, number, and shape of gas bubbles as well as the motion of the particle phase. The superficial gas velocity was varied between 1 and 2 Umf . We found that baffles decreased the average equivalent bubble diameter with a simultaneous increase in the total number of bubbles. Moreover, baffles promoted bubble splitting and the formation of air cushions below the baffles and decreased the average particle velocity and acceleration in the bed.

The Fabry-Perot configuration introduces nonlocal coupling that shifts the cavity detuning by the round trip average power of the intracavity field. When compared with ring resonators described by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, nonlocal coupling leads to strongly detuned dark cavity solitons that exist over a wide range of detunings. This shift is a consequence of the counterpropagation of intracavity fields inherent to Fabry-Perot resonators. At difference with ring resonators, the existence and stability of dark soliton solutions are dependent on the size and number of solitons in the cavity.

When it is applied to measuring PA waves generated in the brain, the acoustic properties of the skull bone cause not only strong attenuation but also a distortion of the wavefront, which diminishes image resolution and contrast. This effect is directly proportional to bone thickness. As a result, transcranial PA imaging in humans has been challenging to demonstrate. We measured the acoustic constraints imposed by the human skull to design an ultrasound sensor suitable for transcranial PA imaging and sensing. We imaged the phantoms using a planar Fabry-Perot sensor and employed a range of piezoelectric and optical ultrasound sensors to measure the frequency dependent acoustic transmission through human cranial bone. Transcranial PA images show typical frequency and thickness dependent attenuation and aberration effects associated with acoustic propagation through bone. The skull insertion loss measurements showed significant transmission at low frequencies. In comparison to conventional piezoelectric sensors, the performance of plano-concave optical resonator (PCOR) ultrasound sensors was found to be highly suitable for transcranial PA measurements. They possess high acoustic sensitivity at a low acoustic frequency range that coincides with the transmission window of human skull bone. PCOR sensors showed low noise equivalent pressures and flat frequency response which enabled them to outperform conventional piezoelectric transducers in transcranial PA sensing experiments. Transcranial PA sensing and imaging requires ultrasound sensors with high sensitivity at low acoustic frequencies, and a broad and ideally uniform frequency response. We designed and fabricated PCOR sensors and demonstrated their suitability for transcranial PA sensing. ",

These correlations allow for obtaining an image of an object with light that never interacted with that object. Depending on the imaging configuration, either position or momentum correlations are exploited. We hereby experimentally analyse how the crystal length and pump waist affect the image resolution when using position correlations of photons that have been generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion in a nonlinear interferometer. Our results support existing theoretical models for the dependency of the resolution on the crystal length. In addition, we probe the resolution of our quantum imaging scheme for varying pump waists over one order of magnitude. This analysis reveals the intricate dependency of the resolution on the strength of the correlations within the biphoton states for parameter combinations in which the crystal lengths are much larger than the involved photon wavelengths. We extend the existing models in this parameter regime to properly take nontrivial effects of finite pump waists into account and demonstrate that they match the experimental results. ",

However, generating these non-classical states of light, especially with high intensity and high degree of squeezing, is challenging. To address this problem, we introduce a new concept which uses gain to generate intense sub-Poissonian light at optical frequencies. It exploits a strongly nonlinear gain for photons which arises from a combination of frequency-dependent gain and Kerr nonlinearity. In this laser architecture, the interaction between the gain medium and Kerr nonlinearity suppresses the spontaneous emission at high photon number states, leading to a strong \"negative feedback\" that suppresses photon-number fluctuations. We discuss realistic implementations of this concept based on the use of solid-state gain media in laser cavities with Kerr nonlinear materials, showing how 90% squeezing of photon number fluctuations below the shot noise level can be realized.

Here, we introduce a novel nonlinear process to efficiently generate magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) by exploiting exceptional points (EPs) in a coupled system comprising a pump-induced magnon mode and a Kittel mode. Even without any cavity, our method greatly improves the efficiency of nonlinear frequency conversion and achieves optimal MFCs at low pump power. Additionally, our novel nonlinear process enables excellent tunability of EPs using the polarization and power of the pump, simplifying MFC generation and manipulation.

    "abstract": "Objective: Despite recent advancements in quantum computing, the limited number of available qubits has hindered progress in CT reconstruction. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing quantum annealing-based computed tomography (QACT) with current quantum bit levels. Approach: The QACT algorithm aims to precisely solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Furthermore, a novel approach is proposed to reconstruct images by approximating real numbers using the variational method. This approach allows for accurate CT image reconstruction using a small number of qubits. The study examines the impact of projection data quantity and noise on various image sizes ranging from 4x4 to 24x24 pixels. The reconstructed results are compared against conventional reconstruction algorithms, namely maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and filtered back projection (FBP). Main result: By employing the variational approach and utilizing two qubits for each pixel of the image, accurate reconstruction was achieved with an adequate number of projections. Under conditions of abundant projections and lower noise levels, the image quality in QACT outperformed that of MLEM and FBP. However, in situations with limited projection data and in the presence of noise, the image quality in QACT was inferior to that in MLEM. Significance: This study developed the QACT reconstruction algorithm using the variational approach for real-number reconstruction. Remarkably, only 2 qubits were required for each pixel representation, demonstrating their sufficiency for accurate reconstruction. ",

    "title": "Decoupling Bimolecular Recombination Mechanisms in Perovskite Thin Films  Using Photoluminescence Quantum Yield",
    "abstract": "We present a novel analytical model for analysing the spectral photoluminescence quantum yield of non-planar semiconductor thin films. This model considers the escape probability of luminescence and is applied to triple-cation perovskite thin films with a 1-Sun photoluminescence quantum yield approaching 25%. By using our model, we can decouple the internal radiative, external radiative, and non-radiative bi-molecular recombination coefficients. Unlike other techniques that measure these coefficients separately, our proposed method circumvents experimental uncertainties by avoiding the need for multiple photoluminescence measurement techniques. We validate our model by comparing the extracted implied open-circuit voltage, effective luminescence escape probabilities, absorptivity, and absorption coefficient with values obtained using established methods and found that our results are consistent with previous findings. Next, we compare the implied 1-Sun radiative open-circuit voltage and radiative recombination current obtained from our method with literature values. We then convert the implied open-circuit voltage and implied radiative open-circuit voltage to the injection-dependent apparent-effective and apparent-radiative carrier lifetimes, which allow us to decouple the different recombination coefficients. Using this lifetime analysis, we predict the efficiency losses due to each recombination mechanism. Finally, by comparing several different thicknesses, we conclude that the non-radiative bimolecular recombination is likely caused by surface recombination. Our proposed analytical model provides a reliable method for analysing the spectral photoluminescence quantum yield of semiconductor thin films, which will facilitate further research into the photovoltaic properties of these materials.

    "abstract": "The capacity of information delivered by single photons is boosted by encoding high-dimensional quantum dits in their transverse shape. Transporting such high-dimensional quantum dits in optical networks may be accomplished using multimode optical fibers, which support the low-loss transmission of multiple spatial modes over existing infrastructure. However, when photons propagate through a multimode fiber their transverse shape gets scrambled because of mode mixing and modal interference. This is usually corrected using free-space spatial light modulators, inhibiting a robust all-fiber operation. In this work, we demonstrate an all-fiber approach for controlling the shape of single photons and the spatial correlations between entangled photon pairs, using carefully controlled mechanical perturbations of the fiber. We optimize these perturbations to localize the spatial distribution of a single photon or the spatial correlations of photon pairs in a single spot, enhancing the signal in the optimized spot by over an order of magnitude. Using the same approach we show a similar enhancement for coupling light from a multimode fiber into a single-mode fiber. ",

The higher-order Weyl semimetal phases, with their higher-order topology arising from quantized dipole or quadrupole bulk polarizations, have been demonstrated in phononics and circuits. Here, we experimentally discover a class of higher-order Weyl semimetal phase in a three-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC), exhibiting the concurrence of the surface and hinge Fermi arcs from the nonzero Chern number and the nontrivial generalized real Chern number, respectively, coined a real higher-order Weyl PhC. Notably, the projected two-dimensional subsystem with kz = 0 is a real Chern insulator, belonging to the Stiefel-Whitney class with real Bloch wavefunctions, which is distinguished fundamentally from the Chern class with complex Bloch wavefunctions. Our work offers an ideal photonic platform for exploring potential applications and material properties associated with the higher-order Weyl points and the Stiefel-Whitney class of topological phases.

    "abstract": "The high critical magnetic field and relatively high critical temperature of niobium nitride (NbN) make it a promising material candidate for applications in superconducting quantum technology. However, NbN-based devices and circuits are sensitive to decoherence sources such as two-level system (TLS) defects. Here, we numerically and experimentally investigate NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonator arrays, with a 100 nm thickness, capacitively coupled to a common coplanar waveguide on a silicon chip. We observe that the resonators' internal quality factor (Qi) decreases from Qi ~ 1.07*10^6 in a high power regime (< nph > = 27000) to Qi ~ 1.36 *10^5 in single photon regime at temperature T = 100 mK. Data from this study is consistent with the TLS theory, which describes the TLS interactions in resonator substrates and interfaces. Moreover, we study the temperature dependence internal quality factor and frequency tuning of the coplanar waveguide resonators to characterise the quasiparticle density of NbN. We observe that the increase in kinetic inductance at higher temperatures is the main reason for the frequency shift. Finally, we measure the resonators' resonance frequency and internal quality factor at single photon regime in response to in-plane magnetic fields B||. We verify that Qi stays well above 10^4 up to B|| = 240 mT in the photon number < nph > = 1.8 at T = 100 mK. Our results may pave the way for realising robust microwave superconducting circuits for circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) at high magnetic fields necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computing, and ultrasensitive quantum sensing.

The structure of this formula resembles the well-known expression for the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in a strong laser field, but includes the dynamical assistance from the weak laser mode. We analyze the dependence of the dynamical rate enhancement on the applied field parameters and show, in particular, that it is substantially higher when the two laser modes have opposite helicity.
