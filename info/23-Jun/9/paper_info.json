    "abstract": "The recent progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has boosted the computational possibilities in fields where standard computers are not able to perform. The AI paradigm is to emulate human intelligence and therefore breaks the familiar architecture on which digital computers are based. In particular, neuromorphic computing, artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning models mimic how the brain computes. Large networks of interconnected neurons whose synapsis are individually strengthened or weakened during the learning phase find many applications. With this respect, photonics is a suitable platform to implement ANN hardware thanks to its speed, low power dissipation and multi-wavelength opportunities. One photonic device candidate to perform as an optical neuron is the optical microring resonator. Indeed microring resonators show both a nonlinear response and a capability of optical energy storage, which can be interpreted as a fading memory. Moreover, by using silicon photonics, the photonic integrated circuits can be fabricated in volume and with integrated electronics on board. For these reasons, here, we describe the physics of silicon microring resonators and of arrays of microring resonators for application in neuromorphic computing. We describe different types of ANNs from feed-forward networks to photonics extreme learning machines and reservoir computing. In addition, we discuss also hybrid systems where silicon microresonators are coupled to other active materials. this review aims to introduce the basics and to discuss the most recent developments in the field.

    "title": "Mediation of Collisionless Turbulent Dissipation Through Cyclotron  Resonance",
    "abstract": "The dissipation of magnetized turbulence is fundamental to understanding energy transfer and heating in astrophysical systems. Collisionless interactions, such as resonant wave-particle process, are known to play a role in shaping turbulent astrophysical environments. Here, we present evidence for the mediation of turbulent dissipation in the solar wind by ion-cyclotron waves. Our results show that ion-cyclotron waves interact strongly with magnetized turbulence, indicating that they serve as a major pathway for the dissipation of large-scale electromagnetic fluctuations. We further show that the presence of cyclotron waves significantly weakens observed signatures of intermittency in sub-ion-kinetic turbulence, which are known to be another pathway for dissipation. These observations results suggest that in the absence of cyclotron resonant waves, non-Gaussian, coherent structures are able to form at sub-ion-kinetic scales, and are likely responsible for turbulent heating. We further find that the cross helicity, i.e. the level of Alfv\\'enicity of the fluctuations, correlates strongly with the presence of ion-scale waves, demonstrating that dissipation of collisionless plasma turbulence is not a universal process, but that the pathways to heating and dissipation at small scales are controlled by the properties of the large-scale turbulent fluctuations. We argue that these observations support the existence of a helicity barrier, in which highly Alfv\\'enic, imbalanced, turbulence is prevented from cascading to sub-ion scales thus resulting in significant ion-cyclotron resonant heating. Our results may serve as a significant step in constraining the nature of turbulent heating in a wide variety of astrophysical systems. ",

    "abstract": "Optical cavities, resonant with vibrational or electronic transitions of material within the cavity, enable control of light-matter interaction. Previous studies have reported cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivity, fluorescence, phase behavior, and charge transport. Here, we explore the effect of resonant cavity-phonon coupling on the transient photoconductivity in a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite. To this end, we measure the ultrafast photoconductivity response of perovskite in a tunable Fabry-Perot terahertz cavity, designed to be transparent for optical excitation. The terahertz-cavity field-phonon interaction causes apparent Rabi splitting between the perovskite phonon mode and the cavity mode. We explore whether the cavity-phonon interaction affects the material electron-phonon interaction by determining the charge carrier mobility through the photoconductivity. Despite the apparent hybridization of cavity and phonon modes, we show that the perovskite properties, in both ground (phonon response) and excited (photoconductive response) states, remain unaffected by the tunable light-matter interaction. Yet the response of the integral perovskite-terahertz optical cavity system depends critically on the interaction strength of the cavity with the phonon: the transient terahertz response to optical excitation can be increased up to 3-fold by tuning the cavity-perovskite interaction strength. These results enable tunable switches and frequency-controlled induced transparency devices. ",

Taking inspiration from the adjoint method in electromagnetism, we show how to design graded plates to act as lenses or perform mode shaping. Both of the methods presented are simple, versatile and straightforward to implement, making them useful for designing a wide range of devices for sensing, energy harvesting and vibration isolation.

    "abstract": "The photosensitivity of silicon is inherently very low in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, and it drops rapidly beyond 800 nm in near-infrared wavelengths. Herein, we have experimentally demonstrated a technique utilizing photon-trapping surface structures to show a prodigious improvement of photoabsorption in one-micrometer-thin silicon, surpassing the inherent absorption efficiency of gallium arsenide for a broad spectrum. The photon-trapping structures allow the bending of normally incident light by almost ninety degrees to transform into laterally propagating modes along the silicon plane. Consequently, the propagation length of light increases, contributing to more than an order of magnitude improvement in absorption efficiency in photodetectors. This high absorption phenomenon is explained by FDTD analysis, where we show an enhanced photon density of states while substantially reducing the optical group velocity of light compared to silicon without photon-trapping structures, leading to significantly enhanced light-matter interactions. Our simulations also predict an enhanced absorption efficiency of photodetectors designed using 30 and 100-nanometer silicon thin films that are compatible with CMOS electronics. Despite a very thin absorption layer, such photon-trapping structures can enable high-efficiency and high-speed photodetectors needed in ultra-fast computer networks, data communication, and imaging systems with the potential to revolutionize on-chip logic and optoelectronic integration.

    "abstract": "Mode-locked lasers (MLLs) have enabled ultrafast sciences and technologies by generating ultrashort pulses with peak powers substantially exceeding their average powers. Recently, tremendous efforts have been focused on realizing integrated MLLs not only to address the challenges associated with their size and power demand, but also to enable transforming the ultrafast technologies into nanophotonic chips, and ultimately to unlock their potential for a plethora of applications. However, till now the prospect of integrated MLLs driving ultrafast nanophotonic circuits has remained elusive because of their typically low peak powers, lack of controllability, and challenges with integration with appropriate nanophotonic platforms. Here, we overcome these limitations by demonstrating an electrically-pumped actively MLL in nanophotonic lithium niobate based on its hybrid integration with a III-V semiconductor optical amplifier. Our MLL generates $\\sim$4.8 ps optical pulses around 1065 nm at a repetition rate of $\\sim$10 GHz, with pulse energy exceeding 2.6 pJ and a high peak power beyond 0.5 W. We show that both the repetition rate and the carrier-envelope-offset of the resulting frequency comb can be flexibly controlled in a wide range using the RF driving frequency and the pump current, paving the way for fully-stabilized on-chip frequency combs in nanophotonics. Our work marks an important step toward fully-integrated nonlinear and ultrafast photonic systems in nanophotonic lithium niobate. ",

    "abstract": "The thermal conductivity (k) of polycrystalline silicon carbide thin films is relevant for thermal management in emerging silicon carbide applications like MEMS and optoelectronic devices. In such films k can be substantially reduced by microstructure features including grain boundaries, thin film surfaces, and porosity, while these microstructural effects can also be manipulated through thermal annealing. Here, we investigate these effects by using microfabricated suspended devices to measure the thermal conductivities of nine LPCVD silicon carbide films of varying thickness (from 120 - 300 nm) and annealing conditions (as-grown and annealed at 950 degrees Celsius and 1100 degrees Celsius for 2 hours, and in one case 17 hours). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and density measurements are also used to characterize the effects of the annealing on the microstructure of selected samples. Compared to as-deposited films, annealing at 1100 degrees Celsius typically increases the estimated grain size from 5.5 nm to 6.6 nm while decreasing the porosity from around 6.5% to practically fully dense. This corresponds to a 34% increase in the measured thin film thermal conductivity near room temperature, from 5.8 W/m-K to 7.8 W/m-K. These thermal conductivity measurements show good agreement of better than 3% with fits using a simple theoretical model based on kinetic theory combined with a Maxwell-Garnett porosity correction. Grain boundary scattering plays the dominant role in reducing the thermal conductivity of these films compared to bulk single-crystal values, while both grain size increase and porosity decrease play important roles in the partial k recovery of the films upon annealing. This work demonstrates the effects of modifying the microstructure and thus the thermal conductivity of silicon carbide thin films by thermal annealing. ",

Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\\theta \\approx 1.05^{\\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\\circ}<\\theta<1.3^{\\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking, induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in Moir\\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.
