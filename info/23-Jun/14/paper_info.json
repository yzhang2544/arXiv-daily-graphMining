    "abstract": "Electronic absorption spectrum of beta-carotene (b-Car) is studied using quantum chemistry and quantum dynamics simulations. Vibrational normal modes were computed in optimized geometries of the electronic ground state S0 and the optically bright excited S2 state using the time-dependent density functional theory. By expressing the S2 state normal modes in terms of the ground state modes, we find that no one-to-one correspondence between the ground and excited state vibrational modes exists. Using the ab initio results, we simulated b-Car absorption spectrum with all 282 vibrational modes in a model solvent at 300K using the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle (TDVP) and are able to qualitatively reproduce the full absorption lineshape. By comparing the 282-mode model with the prominent 2-mode model, widely used to interpret carotenoid experiments, we find that the full 282-mode model better describe the high frequency progression of carotenoid absorption spectra, hence, vibrational modes become highly mixed during the S0 -> S2 optical excitation. The obtained results suggest that electronic energy dissipation is mediated by numerous vibrational modes. ",

Results show that the investigated compounds are semiconductors with tunable bandgaps characteristics that can be used in devices like light emitting diodes, and predict the suitability of the (CsMA)NaBiI$_6$ organic-inorganic hybrid double perovskite in this study for optoelectronic applications owing to its high absorption coefficient (in the order of $10^6$cm$^{-1}$), dielectric constant ($\\approx 3.24$), and refractive index (2.50) as well as its stability as revealed by its high formation energy. Additionally, the high absorption coefficient, high refractive indices and dielectric constants of the investigated materials posits that they have a number of optoelectronic applications including photovoltaic cells among others.

    "abstract": "In this work, we experimentally investigate the frequency limit of Hall effect sensor designs based on a 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG) gallium arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs/AlGaAs) heterostructure. The frequency limit is measured and compared for four GaAs/AlGaAs Hall effect sensor designs where the Ohmic contact length (contact geometry) is varied across the four devices. By varying the geometry, the trade-off in sensitivity and frequency limit is explored and the underlying causes of the frequency limit from the resistance and capacitance perspective is investigated. Current spinning, the traditional method to remove offset noise, imposes a practical frequency limit on Hall effect sensors. The frequency limit of the Hall effect sensor, without current spinning, is significantly higher. Wide-frequency Hall effect sensors can measure currents in power electronics that operate at higher frequencies is one such application. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical investigation of power-law fluid flow in the trapezoidal cavity has been conducted by incompressible finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method (IFDLBM). By designing the equilibrium distribution function, the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) can be recovered exactly. Through the coordinate transformation method, the body-fitted grid in physical region is transformed into a uniform grid in computational region. The effect of Reynolds (Re) number, the power-law index $n$ and the vertical angle {\\theta} on the trapezoidal cavity are investigated. According to the numerical results, we come to some conclusions. For low Re number Re=100, it can be found that the behavior of power-law fluid flow becomes more complicated with the increase of n. And as vertical angle {\\theta} decreases, the flow becomes smooth and the number of vortices decreases. For high Re numbers, the flow development becomes more complex, the number and strength of vortices increase. If the Reynolds number increases further, the power-law fluid will changes from steady flow to periodic flow and then to turbulent flow. For the steady flow, the lager the {\\theta}, the more complicated the vortices. And the critical Re number from steady to periodic state decreases with the decrease of power-law index n. ",

Nevertheless, the lack of universal in-situ magnetic measurement techniques at megabar pressures makes it difficult to understand the underlying physics of materials' behavior at extreme conditions, such as high-temperature superconductivity of hydrides and the formation or destruction of the local magnetic moments in magnetic systems, etc. Here we break through the limitations of pressure on quantum sensors and develop the in-situ magnetic detection technique at megabar pressures with high sensitivity (~1{\\mu}T/Hz^(1\\2)) and sub-microscale spatial resolution. By directly imaging the magnetic field and the evolution of magnetic domains, we observe the macroscopic magnetic transition of Fe3O4 in the megabar pressure range from strong ferromagnetism ({\\alpha}-Fe3O4) to weak ferromagnetism ({\\beta}-Fe3O4) and finally to non-magnetism ({\\gamma}-Fe3O4). The scenarios for magnetic changes in Fe3O4 characterized here shed light on the direct magnetic microstructure observation in bulk materials at high pressure and contribute to understanding the mechanism of magnetic moment suppression related to spin crossover. The presented method can potentially investigate the spin-orbital coupling and magnetism-superconductivity competition in magnetic systems. ",

The momentum state occupancy entropy is counted with a continuous representation of boson number and averages are obtained with umbrella sampling. Instantaneous snapshots of the Bose-Einstein condensed system show multiple highly occupied momentum states. The viscosity is obtained from the Onsager-Green-Kubo relation with the time correlation function modified in the quantum case. On the saturation curve, at higher temperatures the viscosities of the classical and quantum liquids are equal. With decreasing temperature the viscosity of the classical liquid increases whereas that of the quantum liquid decreases. Below the $\\lambda$-transition the viscosity lies significantly below the classical value, being small but positive due to the mixture of condensed and uncondensed bosons.

When initially the atom is excited at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity via the spontaneous emission, and the photons in the cavity can be transmitted into the waveguide and then re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system through the feedback channel. When the cavity is coupled with a single waveguide, the generation of multi-photon states in the waveguide can be characterized by the exponential stability of the linear control system with feedback delays determined by the feedback loop length. By tuning the feedback loop length, there can be zero or multiple photons in the waveguide. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and this process is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.

Everett's theory is often claimed to be local in the Bell sense.

We discuss and compare different notions of locality often mixed in the Everettian literature and try to explain the nature of the confusion. We conclude with a discussion of probability and statistics in the many-worlds theory and stress that the strong symmetry existing between branches in the theory prohibits the definition of probability and that the theory cannot recover statistics. The only way out from this contradiction is to modify the theory by adding hidden variables \\`a la Bohm and, as a consequence, the new theory is explicitly Bell-nonlocal. ",

Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have developed a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The material properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories based on defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network. ",

Well established methods focus mainly on propagating a quantum system that is initially described exclusively by the ground state wavefunction. In this work, we expand a previously developed formalism within coupled cluster theory, called second response theory, so it propagates quantum systems that are initially described by a general linear combination of different states, which can include the ground state, and show how with a special set of time-dependent cluster operators such propagations are performed. Our theory shows strong consistency with numerically exact results for the determination of quantum mechanical observables, probabilities, and coherences. We discuss unperturbed non-stationary states within second response theory and their ability to predict matrix elements that agree with those found in linear and quadratic response theories. This work also discusses an approximate regularized methodology to treat systems with potential instabilities in their ground-state cluster amplitudes, and compare such approximations with respect to reference results from standard unitary theory.
