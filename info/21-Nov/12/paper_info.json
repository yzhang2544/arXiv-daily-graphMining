    "title": "A soft thumb-sized vision-based sensor with accurate all-round force  perception",
    "abstract": "Vision-based haptic sensors have emerged as a promising approach to robotic touch due to affordable high-resolution cameras and successful computer-vision techniques. However, their physical design and the information they provide do not yet meet the requirements of real applications. We present a robust, soft, low-cost, vision-based, thumb-sized 3D haptic sensor named Insight: it continually provides a directional force-distribution map over its entire conical sensing surface. Constructed around an internal monocular camera, the sensor has only a single layer of elastomer over-molded on a stiff frame to guarantee sensitivity, robustness, and soft contact. Furthermore, Insight is the first system to combine photometric stereo and structured light using a collimator to detect the 3D deformation of its easily replaceable flexible outer shell. The force information is inferred by a deep neural network that maps images to the spatial distribution of 3D contact force (normal and shear). Insight has an overall spatial resolution of 0.4 mm, force magnitude accuracy around 0.03 N, and force direction accuracy around 5 degrees over a range of 0.03--2 N for numerous distinct contacts with varying contact area. The presented hardware and software design concepts can be transferred to a wide variety of robot parts. ",

    "title": "Decay bounds for Bernstein functions of Hermitian matrices with  applications to the fractional graph Laplacian",
    "abstract": "For many functions of matrices $f(A)$, it is known that their entries exhibit a rapid -- often exponential or even superexponential -- decay away from the sparsity pattern of the matrix $A$. In this paper we specifically focus on the class of Bernstein functions, which contains the fractional powers $A^\\alpha$, $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ as an important special case, and derive new decay bounds by exploiting known results for the matrix exponential in conjunction with the L\\'evy--Khintchine integral representation. As a particular special case, we find a result concerning the power law decay of the strength of connection in nonlocal network dynamics described by the fractional graph Laplacian, which improves upon known results from the literature by doubling the exponent in the power law.

    "title": "Exponential separations between learning with and without quantum memory",
    "abstract": "We study the power of quantum memory for learning properties of quantum systems and dynamics, which is of great importance in physics and chemistry. Many state-of-the-art learning algorithms require access to an additional external quantum memory. While such a quantum memory is not required a priori, in many cases, algorithms that do not utilize quantum memory require much more data than those which do. We show that this trade-off is inherent in a wide range of learning problems. Our results include the following: (1) We show that to perform shadow tomography on an $n$-qubit state rho with $M$ observables, any algorithm without quantum memory requires $\\Omega(\\min(M, 2^n))$ samples of rho in the worst case. Up to logarithmic factors, this matches the upper bound of [HKP20] and completely resolves an open question in [Aar18, AR19]. (2) We establish exponential separations between algorithms with and without quantum memory for purity testing, distinguishing scrambling and depolarizing evolutions, as well as uncovering symmetry in physical dynamics. Our separations improve and generalize prior work of [ACQ21] by allowing for a broader class of algorithms without quantum memory. (3) We give the first tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity. We prove that to estimate absolute values of all $n$-qubit Pauli observables, algorithms with $k < n$ qubits of quantum memory require at least $\\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ samples, but there is an algorithm using $n$-qubit quantum memory which only requires $O(n)$ samples. The separations we show are sufficiently large and could already be evident, for instance, with tens of qubits. This provides a concrete path towards demonstrating real-world advantage for learning algorithms with quantum memory. ",
