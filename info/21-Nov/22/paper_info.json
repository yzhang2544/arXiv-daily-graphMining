    "title": "Joint Delay and Phase Precoding Under True-Time Delay Constraint for THz  Massive MIMO",
    "abstract": "A new approach is presented to the problem of compensating the beam squint effect arising in wideband terahertz (THz) hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, based on the joint optimization of the phase shifter (PS) and true-time delay (TTD) values under per-TTD device time delay constraints. Unlike the prior approaches, the new approach does not require the unbounded time delay assumption; the range of time delay values that a TTD device can produce is strictly limited in our approach. Instead of focusing on the design of TTD values, we jointly optimize both the TTD and PS values to effectively cope with the practical time delay constraint. Simulation results that illustrate the performance benefits of the new method for the beam squint compensation are presented. Through simulations and analysis, we show that our approach is a generalization of the prior TTD-based precoding approaches. ",
