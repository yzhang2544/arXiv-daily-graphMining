    "abstract": "We develop a quantum embedding method that enables accurate and efficient treatment of interactions between molecules and an environment, while explicitly including many-body correlations. The molecule is composed of classical nuclei and quantum electrons, whereas the environment is modeled via charged quantum harmonic oscillators. We construct a general Hamiltonian and introduce a variational ansatz for the correlated ground state of the fully interacting molecule/environment system. This wavefunction is optimized via variational Monte Carlo and the ground state energy is subsequently estimated through diffusion Monte Carlo. The proposed scheme allows an explicit many-body treatment of electrostatic, polarization, and dispersion interactions between the molecule and the environment. We study solvation energies and excitation energies of benzene derivatives, obtaining excellent agreement with explicit ab initio calculations and experiment. ",

    "abstract": "The feature vector mapping used to represent chemical systems is a key factor governing the superior data-efficiency of kernel based quantum machine learning (QML) models applicable throughout chemical compound space. Unfortunately, the most accurate representations require a high dimensional feature mapping, thereby imposing a considerable computational burden on model training and use. We introduce compact yet accurate, linear scaling QML representations based on atomic Gaussian many-body distribution functionals (MBDF), and their derivatives. Weighted density functions (DF) of MBDF values are used as global representations which are constant in size, i.e. invariant with respect to the number of atoms. We report predictive performance and training data efficiency that is close to state of the art for two diverse datasets of organic molecules, QM9 and QMugs. Generalization capability has been investigated for atomization energies, HOMO-LUMO eigenvalues and gap, internal energies at 0 K, zero point vibrational energies, dipole moment norm, static isotropic polarizability, and heat capacity as encoded in QM9. MBDF based QM9 performance lowers the optimal Pareto front spanned between sampling and training cost to compute node minutes, effectively sampling chemical compound space with chemical accuracy at a speed of 37 molecules per core second.

    "title": "Denoising Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Data Using Stacked  Autoencoder for Improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Speed of MRS",
    "abstract": "Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) enables non-invasive detection and measurement of biochemicals and metabolites. However, MRS has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when concentrations of metabolites are in the range of the million molars. Standard approach of using a high number of signal averaging (NSA) to achieve sufficient NSR comes at the cost of a long acquisition time. Purpose: We propose to use deep-learning approaches to denoise MRS data without increasing the NSA. Methods: The study was conducted using data collected from the brain spectroscopy phantom and human subjects. We utilized a stack auto-encoder (SAE) network to train deep learning models for denoising low NSA data (NSA = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) randomly truncated from high SNR data collected with high NSA (NSA=192) which were also used to obtain the ground truth. We applied both self-supervised and fully-supervised training approaches and compared their performance of denoising low NSA data based on improved SNRs. Results: With the SAE model, the SNR of low NSA data (NSA = 1) obtained from the phantom increased by 22.8% and the MSE decreased by 47.3%. For low NSA images of the human parietal and temporal lobes, the SNR increased by 43.8% and the MSE decreased by 68.8%. In all cases, the chemical shift of NAA in the denoised spectra closely matched with the high SNR spectra, suggesting no distortion to the spectra from denoising. Furthermore, the denoising performance of the SAE model was more effective in denoising spectra with higher noise levels. Conclusions: The reported SAE denoising method is a model-free approach to enhance the SNR of low NSA MRS data. With the denoising capability, it is possible to acquire MRS data with a few NSA, resulting in shorter scan times while maintaining adequate spectroscopic information for detecting and quantifying the metabolites of interest.

The thermoelastic properties, structure factors, and optical properties of beryllium are important in the study. In this paper, the static structure factors, ion-ion dynamic structure factors, adiabatic velocity, and optical properties of beryllium along the Hugoniot are calculated by ab initio simulations concurrently. The dynamic structure factor via the intermediate scattering function extracts the dispersion relation for the collective excitations. The static structure factors show that beryllium atoms are randomly distributed. By collecting the peak position of dynamic structure factors, the dispersion relation and adiabatic sound velocity are derived. By the calculated equation of state, the thermoelastic properties and adiabatic sound velocity are derived. The two calculated methods about adiabatic sound velocity are verified to be equivalent. ",

A stainless-steel shell is welded around the two magnets before the insertion into the cryostat. There is a limit on how much coil preload increase induced by the shell welding is allowed. Distributed Rayleigh backscattering fiber optics sensors were used for the first time to obtain a strain map over a wide area of a Nb3Sn magnet cold mass shell. Data were collected during welding of the first LMQXFA cold mass and the results confirm that the increase of the coil pole azimuthal pre-stress after welding do not exceed requirements. ",

The transmission loss of 3D printed metamaterials with Hilbert fractal patterns related to configurations from the zeroth to the fourth order is investigated here using impedance tube tests and Finite Element models. We evaluate, in particular, the impact of the equivalent porosity and the relative size of the cavity of the fractal pattern versus the overall dimensions of the metamaterial unit. We also provide an analytical formulation that relates the acoustic cavity resonances in the fractal patterns and the frequencies associated with the maxima of the transmission losses, providing opportunities to tune the sound insulation properties through control of the fractal architecture.

    "abstract": "The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova \\& Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the CBE with a significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the method to perform quantum simulations that follow the evolution of self-gravitating systems. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64$\\times$64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. We propose a direct method to generate initial conditions as well as a method to retrieve necessary information from a register of multiple qubits. Our simulation scheme achieves $\\mathcal{O}(N_v^3)$ less computational complexity than the classical method, where $N_v$ is the number of discrete velocity grids per dimension. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers. ",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulation of turbulent fluid dynamics needs to either parameterize turbulence-which introduces large uncertainties-or explicitly resolve the smallest scales-which is prohibitively expensive. Here we provide evidence through analytic bounds and numerical studies that a potential quantum exponential speedup can be achieved to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations governing turbulence using quantum computing. Specifically, we provide a formulation of the lattice Boltzmann equation for which we give evidence that low-order Carleman linearization is much more accurate than previously believed for these systems and that for computationally interesting examples. This is achieved via a combination of reformulating the nonlinearity and accurately linearizing the dynamical equations, effectively trading nonlinearity for additional degrees of freedom that add negligible expense in the quantum solver. Based on this we apply a quantum algorithm for simulating the Carleman-linerized lattice Boltzmann equation and provide evidence that its cost scales logarithmically with system size, compared to polynomial scaling in the best known classical algorithms. This work suggests that an exponential quantum advantage may exist for simulating fluid dynamics, paving the way for simulating nonlinear multiscale transport phenomena in a wide range of disciplines using quantum computing.

This article proposes a conceptual framework for Responsible QT that seeks to integrate considerations about ethical, legal, social, and policy implications (ELSPI) into quantum R&D, while responding to the Responsible Research and Innovation dimensions of anticipation, inclusion, reflection and responsiveness. After examining what makes QT unique, we argue that quantum innovation should be guided by a methodological framework for Responsible QT, aimed at jointly safeguarding against risks by proactively addressing them, engaging stakeholders in the innovation process, and continue advancing QT (SEA). We further suggest operationalizing the SEA-framework by establishing quantum-specific guiding principles. The impact of quantum computing on information security is used as a case study to illustrate (1) the need for a framework that guides Responsible QT, and (2) the usefulness of the SEA-framework for QT generally. Additionally, we examine how our proposed SEA-framework for responsible innovation can inform the emergent regulatory landscape affecting QT, and provide an outlook of how regulatory interventions for QT as base-layer technology could be designed, contextualized, and tailored to their exceptional nature in order to reduce the risk of unintended counterproductive effects of policy interventions. Laying the groundwork for a responsible quantum ecosystem, the research community and other stakeholders are called upon to further develop the recommended guiding principles, and discuss their operationalization into best practices and real-world applications. Our proposed framework should be considered a starting point for these much needed, highly interdisciplinary efforts. ",
