    "abstract": "Polarization plays crucial role in light-matter interactions; hence its overall manipulation is an essential key to unlock the versatility of light manufacturing, especially in femtosecond laser direct writing. Existing polarization-shaping techniques, however, only focus on the manipulation in transverse plane of a light beam, namely a two-dimensional control. In this paper, we propose a novel passive strategy that exploits a class of femtosecond laser written space varying birefringent elements, to shape the polarization state along the optical path. As a demonstration, we generate a three-dimensional structured Bessel beam whose linear polarization state is slowly evolving along the focus (typ. 90 degrees within 60 lightwave periods). Such a \"helical polarized\" Bessel beam allows imprinting \"twisted nanogratings\" in SiO2 resulting in an extrinsic optical chirality at a micrometric scale, which owns a high optical rotation. Our work brings new perspectives for three-dimensional polarization manipulations and would find applications in structured light, light-matter interaction and chiral device fabrication. ",

    "abstract": "On-chip ultraviolet sources are of great interest for building compact and scalable atomic clocks, quantum computers, and spectrometers; however, few material platforms are suitable for integrated ultraviolet light generation. Of these materials, thin-film lithium niobate is the most competitive due to its ability to be quasi-phase-matched, optical confinement, and nonlinear properties. Here, we present efficient (197 $\\pm$ 5 %/W/cm$^{2}$) second harmonic generation of UV-A light in a periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguide. We achieve on-chip ultraviolet powers of 30 $\\mu$W, demonstrating the potential for compact frequency-doubling of common near-IR laser diodes. By using a large cross section waveguide (600 nm film thickness), we achieve insensitivity to fabrication errors, and can attain first-order quasi-phase-matching with relatively long poling periods (>1.5 $\\mu$m). The device also demonstrates linear wavelength tunability using temperature. By varying the poling period, we have achieved the shortest reported wavelength (355 nm) generated through frequency doubling in thin-film lithium niobate. Our results open up new avenues to realize ultraviolet on-chip sources and chip-scale photonics. ",

    "abstract": "We carefully investigated the storage of lithium in titania films on various substrates as a function of size. The experiments enable us to separate contributions from bulk and boundary storage. The bulk storage is thermodynamically modelled in terms of charge carrier chemistry obeying local electroneutrality and of boundary storage according to the space charge conception. The battery capacity measurements are complemented by bias dependent measurements of impedance, series and parallel resistance as well as capacitance. Independent information on electron and Li distribution is gained by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), aberration-corrected annular-bright-field (ABF) STEM. As a result, we obtain the full picture in terms of equilibrium storage (lithium content) and charge carrier concentrations as a function of spatial coordinates with cell voltage as a parameter. This corresponds to no less than a unification of intercalation storage and super-capacitive storage, which are usually considered as separate phenomena, the reason for this lying in the hitherto lack of an adequate defect-chemical and nanoionic picture.

NbTe$_2$-PVA film SA was successfully prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation and spin coating methods, with a modulation depth of up to 10.87%. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of NbTe$_2$-based SA film tested through the open-aperture Z-scan laser measurement is 0.62. A conventional soliton with a pulse duration of 858 fs was generated using NbTe$_2$-based SA, which was demonstrated to be a kind of polarization-locked vector soliton in further investigation.

Many of these physics are characterized by band structures in more than one dimensions. Existing efforts on band structure measurements in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension however are limited to either one-dimensional Brillouin zones or one-dimensional subsets of multi-dimensional Brillouin zones. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to fully measure multi-dimensional band structures in the synthetic frequency dimension. We use a single photonic resonator under dynamical modulation to create a multi-dimensional synthetic frequency lattice. We show that the band structure of such a lattice over the entire multi-dimensional Brillouin zone can be measured by introducing a gauge potential into the lattice Hamiltonian. Using this method, we perform experimental measurements of two-dimensional band structures of a Hermitian and a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The measurements reveal some of the general properties of point-gap topology of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in more than one dimensions. Our results demonstrate experimental capabilities to fully characterize high-dimensional physical phenomena in the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. ",

Here, we report the first generation of acoustic spatiotemporal vortex pulses. We utilize an acoustic meta-grating with mirror-symmetry breaking as the spatiotemporal vortex generator. In the momentum-frequency domain, we unravel that the transmission spectrum functions exhibit a topological phase transition where the vortices with opposite topological charges are created or annihilated in pairs. Furthermore, with the topological textures of the nodal lines, these vortices are robust and exploited to generate spatiotemporal vortex pulse against structural perturbations and disorder.

The two-dimensional spectra clearly reveal the energy-momentum dispersion of band structures which is in perfect agreement with the simulation results. The isofrequency contours can be measured easily by adding a bandpass filter with a desired photon energy. Furthermore, it is convenient to observe clearly and directly the optical singularity -- the optical bound states in the continuum featured by dark point in three-dimensional photoluminescence spectra. The polarization-resolved isofrequency contours clearly show that this dark point is the center of an azimuthally polarized vortex. Finally, the helical topological edge states can be easily observed in photonic topological insulators with deformed hexagonal lattices. Our work provides a simple and effective approach for exploring topological photonics and other intriguing phenomena hidden in the photonic crystal slabs. ",

Overall, the unique design enables a direct laser excitation from the back of the on-chip device and very efficient coupling of the highly collimated photon emission to either low numerical aperture (NA) free space optics or directly to an optical fiber from the front. To show the versatility of the concept, we fabricate devices containing either a colloidal quantum dot or a silicon-vacancy center containing nanodiamond, which are accurately coupled to the nano-antenna using two different nano-positioning methods. Both back-excited devices display front collection efficiencies of about 70 % at NAs as low as 0.5. Moreover, the combination of back-excitation with forward low-NA directionality enables direct coupling of the emitted photons into a proximal optical fiber without the need of any coupling optics, thereby facilitating and greatly simplifying future integration.

    "abstract": "Liou-Steffen splitting (AUSM) schemes are popular for low Mach number simulations, however, like many numerical schemes for compressible flow they require careful modification to accurately resolve convective features in this regime. Previous analyses of these schemes usually focus only on a single discrete scheme at the convective limit, only considering flow with acoustic effects empirically, if at all. In our recent paper Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023 we derived constraints on the artificial diffusion scaling of low Mach number schemes for flows both with and without acoustic effects, and applied this analysis to Roe-type finite-volume schemes. In this paper we form approximate diffusion matrices for the Liou-Steffen splitting, as well as the closely related Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings. We use the constraints found in Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023 to derive and analyse the required scaling of each splitting at low Mach number. By transforming the diffusion matrices to the entropy variables we can identify erroneous diffusion terms compared to the ideal form used in Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023. These terms vanish asymptotically for the Liou-Steffen splitting, but result in spurious entropy generation for the Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings unless a particular form of the interface pressure is used. Numerical examples for acoustic and convective flow verify the results of the analysis, and show the importance of considering the resolution of the entropy field when assessing schemes of this type.

    "abstract": "Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalizations of time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (DFT) and equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) theory are used to model small molecules strongly coupled to optical cavity modes. We consider two types of calculations. In the first approach (termed ``relaxed''), cavity-induced orbital relaxation effects are included through a coherent-state transformation of the Hamiltonian; this procedure guarantees origin invariance of the energy in post-self-consistent-field calculations. In the second approach (termed ``unrelaxed''), we ignore the coherent-state transformation and the associated orbital relaxation effects. In this case, ground-state unrelaxed QED-CC calculations pick up a modest origin dependence but otherwise reproduces relaxed QED-CC results within the coherent-state basis. On the other hand, a severe origin dependence manifests in ground-state unrelaxed QED mean-field energies. For excitation energies computed at experimentally realizable coupling strengths, relaxed and unrelaxed QED-EOM-CC results are similar, while significant differences emerge for unrelaxed and relaxed QED-TDDFT. First, QED-EOM-CC and relaxed QED-TDDFT both predict that electronic states that are not resonant with the cavity mode are nonetheless perturbed by the cavity. Unrelaxed QED-TDDFT, on the other hand, fails to capture this effect. Second, in the limit of large coupling strengths, relaxed QED-TDDFT tends to overestimate Rabi splittings, while unrelaxed QED-TDDFT underestimates them, given splittings from relaxed QED-EOM-CC as a reference, and relaxed QED-TDDFT generally does the better job of reproducing the QED-EOM-CC results.

This view changed in the 1800s through the pioneering work of Georg Cantor showing that infinite sets follow their own seemingly paradoxical mathematical rules. In 1924, David Hilbert highlighted the strangeness of infinity through a thought experiment now referred to as the Hilbert Hotel paradox, or simply Hilbert's Hotel. The paradox describes an \"fully\" occupied imaginary hotel having infinite number of single-occupancy rooms, the manager can always find a room for new guest by simply shifting current guests to the next highest room, leaving first room vacant. The investigation of wavefield singularities has uncovered the existence of a direct optical analogy to Hilbert's thought experiment. Since then, efforts have been made to investigate the properties of Hilbert's Hotel by controlling the dynamics of phase singularities in``fractional'' order optical vortex beams. Here, we have taken such proposals to the next level and experimentally demonstrated Hilbert's Hotel using both phase and polarization singularities of optical fields. Using a multi-ramped spiral-phase-plate and a supercontinuum source, we generated and controlled fractional order vortex beams for the practical implementation of Hilbert's Hotel in scalar and vector vortex beams. Using a multi-ramped spiral-phase-plate, we show the possibility for complicated transitions of the generalized Hilbert's Hotel. The generic experimental scheme illustrates the usefulness of structured beams in visualizing unusual mathematical concepts and also for fractional vector beams driven fundamental and applied research.

We show that a circuit containing Lorentz-type qubits can be transformed into Fano-type qubits with an asymmetric spectral response, resulting in a significant improvement in isolation (up to 40 dB) and a twofold increase in spectral bandwidth (up to 200 MHz). Our analysis is based on realistic circuit parameters, validated by existing experimental results, and supported by rigorous quantum simulations.

    "abstract": "In this work we numerically analyze a passive photonic integrated neuromorphic accelerator based on hardware-friendly optical spectrum slicing nodes. The proposed scheme can act as a fully analogue convolutional layer, preprocessing information directly in the optical domain. The proposed scheme allows the extraction of meaningful spatio-temporal features from the incoming data, thus when used prior to a simple fully connected digital single layer network it can boost performance with negligible power consumption. Numerical simulations using the MNIST dataset confirmed the acceleration properties of the proposed scheme, where 10 neuromorphic nodes can replace the convolutional layers of a sophisticated LeNet-5 network, thus reducing the number of total floating point operations per second (FLOPS) by 98% while offering a 97.2% classification accuracy.

First, the fluid solution is computed employing a cell centered Finite Volume method. Then, AeroSPEED maps the sound source coming from the flow solution onto the acoustic grid, where finally the Lighthill's wave equation is solved. An ad-hoc projection strategy is adopted to apply the flow source term in the acoustic solver. A model problem with a manufactured solution and the Noise Box test case are used as benchmark for the acoustic problem. We studied the noise generated by the complex flow field around tandem cylinders as a relevant aeroacoustic application. AeroSPEED is an effective and accurate solver for both acoustics and aeroacoustic problems. ",

As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and thus the physically supporting hybrid bath modes.

    "abstract": "Understanding the origins of power loss in superconducting interconnects is essential for the energy efficiency and scalability of superconducting digital logic. At microwave frequencies, power dissipates in both the dielectrics and superconducting wires, and these losses can be of comparable magnitude. A novel method to accurately disentangle such losses by exploiting their frequency dependence using a multi-mode transmission line resonator, supported by a geometric factor concept and a 3D superconductor finite element method (FEM) modeling, is described. Using the method we optimized a planarized fabrication process of reciprocal quantum logic (RQL) for the interconnect loss at 4.2 K and GHz frequencies. The interconnects are composed of niobium ($\\rm Nb$) insulated by silicon dioxide made with a tetraethyl orthosilicate precursor ($\\rm TEOS-SiO_2$). Two process generations use damascene fabrication, and the third one uses Cloisonn\\'{e} fabrication. For all three, $\\rm TEOS-SiO_2$ exhibits a dielectric loss tangent $\\tan \\delta = 0.0012 \\pm 0.0001$, independent of $\\rm Nb$ wire width over $0.25 - 4 \\: \\mu m$. The $\\rm Nb$ loss varies with both the processing and the wire width. For damascene fabrication, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) reveal that Nb oxide and Nb grain growth orientation increase the loss above the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) minimum theoretical resistance $R _{BCS}$. For Cloisonn\\'{e} fabrication, the $0.25 \\: \\mu m$ wide $\\rm Nb$ wires exhibit an intrinsic resistance $R_s = 13 \\pm 1.4 \\: \\mu \\Omega$ at 10 GHz, which is below $R_{BCS} \\approx 17 \\: \\mu \\Omega$. That is arguably the lowest resistive loss reported for $\\rm Nb$. ",

    "title": "Quantum-enhanced sensing on an optical transition via emergent  collective quantum correlations",
    "abstract": "The control over quantum states in atomic systems has led to the most precise optical atomic clocks to date. Their sensitivity is currently bounded by the standard quantum limit, a fundamental floor set by quantum mechanics for uncorrelated particles, which can nevertheless be overcome when operated with entangled particles. Yet demonstrating a quantum advantage in real world sensors is extremely challenging and remains to be achieved aside from two remarkable examples, LIGO and more recently HAYSTAC. Here we illustrate a pathway for harnessing scalable entanglement in an optical transition using 1D chains of up to 51 ions with state-dependent interactions that decay as a power-law function of the ion separation. We show our sensor can be made to behave as a one-axis-twisting (OAT) model, an iconic fully connected model known to generate scalable squeezing. The collective nature of the state manifests itself in the preservation of the total transverse magnetization, the reduced growth of finite momentum spin-wave excitations, the generation of spin squeezing comparable to OAT (a Wineland parameter of $-3.9 \\pm 0.3$ dB for only N = 12 ions) and the development of non-Gaussian states in the form of atomic multi-headed cat states in the Q-distribution. The simplicity of our protocol enables scalability to large arrays with minimal overhead, opening the door to advances in timekeeping as well as new methods for preserving coherence in quantum simulation and computation. We demonstrate this in a Ramsey-type interferometer, where we reduce the measurement uncertainty by $-3.2 \\pm 0.5$ dB below the standard quantum limit for N = 51 ions. ",

    "abstract": "All known optical materials have an index of refraction of order unity. Despite the tremendous implications that an ultrahigh index could have for optical technologies, little research has been done on why the refractive index of materials is universally small, and whether this observation is fundamental. Here, we investigate the index of an ordered arrangement of atoms, as a function of atomic density. At dilute densities, this problem falls into the realm of quantum optics, where atoms do not interact with one another except via the scattering of light. On the other hand, when the lattice constant becomes comparable to the Bohr radius, the electronic orbitals begin to overlap, giving rise to quantum chemistry. We present a minimal model that allows for a unifying theory of index spanning these two regimes. A key aspect is the treatment of multiple light scattering, which can be highly non-perturbative over a large density range, and which is the reason that conventional theories of the index break down. In the quantum optics regime, we show that ideal light-matter interactions can have a single-mode nature, allowing for a purely real refractive index that grows with density as $(N/V)^{1/3}$. At the onset of quantum chemistry, we show how two physical mechanisms (excited electron tunneling dynamics and the buildup of electronic density-density correlations) can open up inelastic or spatial multi-mode light scattering processes, which ultimately reduce the index back to order unity while introducing absorption. Around the onset of chemistry, our theory predicts that ultrahigh index ($n\\sim 30$), low-loss materials could in principle be allowed by the laws of nature. ",

Quantum back-action of the spin measurement, ponderomotive squeezing of light, and oscillator spring softening are observed at spin oscillation frequencies down to 6 kHz.

These results constitute an important step towards quantum noise reduction and entanglement-enhanced sensing in the acoustic range using a negative-mass reference frame. In particular, the results are relevant for broadband noise reduction in gravitational wave detectors. ",
