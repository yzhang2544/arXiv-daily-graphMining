    "abstract": "We report that equidistant 1D arrays of thin-film Lithium Niobate nano-waveguides generically support topological edge states. Unlike conventional coupled-waveguide topological systems, the topological properties of these arrays are dictated by the interplay between intra- and inter-modal couplings of two families of guided modes with different parities. Exploiting two modes within the same waveguide to design a topological invariant allows us to decrease the system size by a factor of two and substantially simplify the structure. We present two example geometries where topological edge states of different types (based on either quasi-TE or quasi-TM modes) can be observed within a wide range of wavelengths and array spacings.

    "abstract": "The interaction of relativistically intense lasers with opaque targets represents a highly non-linear, multi-dimensional parameter space. This limits the utility of sequential 1D scanning of experimental parameters for the optimisation of secondary radiation, although to-date this has been the accepted methodology due to low data acquisition rates. High repetition-rate (HRR) lasers augmented by machine learning present a valuable opportunity for efficient source optimisation. Here, an automated, HRR-compatible system produced high fidelity parameter scans, revealing the influence of laser intensity on target pre-heating and proton generation. A closed-loop Bayesian optimisation of maximum proton energy, through control of the laser wavefront and target position, produced proton beams with equivalent maximum energy to manually-optimized laser pulses but using only 60% of the laser energy. This demonstration of automated optimisation of laser-driven proton beams is a crucial step towards deeper physical insight and the construction of future radiation sources. ",

Q-switching of the laser cavity is the best known technique for generating high-energy pulses, and typically such systems are in the realm of large bench-top solid-state lasers and fiber lasers, especially in the long wavelength range >1.8 um, thanks to their large energy storage capacity. However, in integrated photonics, the very property of tight mode confinement, that enables a small form factor, becomes an impediment to high energy application due to small optical mode cross-section. In this work, we demonstrate complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible, rare-earth gain based large mode area (LMA) passively Q-switched laser in a compact footprint. We demonstrate high on-chip output pulse energy of >150 nJ in single transverse fundamental mode in the eye-safe window (1.9 um), with a slope efficiency ~ 40% in a footprint of ~9 mm2. The high energy pulse generation demonstrated in this work is comparable or in many cases exceeds Q-switched fiber lasers. This bodes well for field applications in medicine and space. ",

We transported it from the Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan to the National Institute of Metrology, Beijing. The absolute frequency of the 729 nm clock transition was measured for up to 35 days by tracing its frequency to the second of International System of Units. Some improvements were implemented in the measurement process, such as the increased effective up-time of 91.3 % of the 40Ca+ optical clock over a 35-day-period, the reduced statistical uncertainty of the comparison between the optical clock and hydrogen maser, and the use of longer measurement times to reduce the uncertainty of the frequency traceability link. The absolute frequency measurement of the 40Ca+ optical clock yielded a value of 411042129776400.26 (13) Hz with an uncertainty of 3.2*10^(-16), which is reduced by a factor of 1.7 compared with our previous results. As a result of the increase in the operating rate of the optical clock, the accuracy of 35 days of absolute frequency measurement can be comparable to the best results of different institutions in the world based on different optical frequency measurements.

In this Article we show that the dynamics is nearly Hamiltonian over time scales much longer than those of the cavity losses. More precisely, we prove that it can be represented as a pseudo spatio-temporal pattern generated by a nonlinear wave equation equipped with a Toda potential. The existence of two constants of motion (identified as pseudo energies), thereby, elucidates the reason why it is so hard to simplify the original model: the adiabatic elimination of the polarization must be accurate enough to describe the dynamics correctly over unexpectedly long time scales. Finally, since the nonlinear wave equation with Toda potential can be simulated on much longer times than the previous models, this opens up the route to the numerical (and theoretical) investigation of realistic setups.

The laser diode is mounted in a cylindrical mount that allows vertical adjustments while maintaining thermal contact with the temperature stabilized base plate. The wavelength tuning is achieved by horizontal displacement of the diffraction grating about an optimal pivot point. The compact design increases the robustness and passive stability of the ECDL and the stiff but light-weight diffraction grating-arm reduces the susceptibility to low-frequency mechanical vibrations. The linewidth of the ECDL is ~360 kHz. We use the 671 nm ECDL, without any additional power amplification, for laser cooling and trapping of lithium atoms in a magneto-optical trap. This simple, low-cost ECDL design using off-the-shelf laser diodes without anti-reflection coating can also be adapted to other wavelengths. ",

LN took a great stride toward compact photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with the development of partially-etched LN on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. However, integration density is still limited for future high-compact PICs due to the partial edge nature of their waveguides. Here, we demonstrate a fully-etched LN PIC platform which, for the first time, simultaneously achieves ultra-low propagation loss and compact circuit size. The tightly-confined fully-etched LN waveguides with smooth sidewalls allow us to bring the bending radius down to 20 $\\mu$m (corresponds to 1 THz FSR). We have achieved compact high-$Q$ microring resonators with $Q/V$ of 7.1 $\\times$ 10$^{4}$ $\\mu$m$^{-3}$, almost one order of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations. The statistical mean propagation losses of our LN waveguides is 8.5 dB/m (corresponds to mean $Q$-factor of 4.9 $\\times$ 10$^{6}$) even with a small bending radius of 40 $\\mu$m. Our compact and ultra-low-loss LN platform shows great potential in future miniaturized multifunctional integration systems. As complementary evidence to show the utility of our platform, we demonstrate soliton microcombs with an ultra-high repetition rate of 500 GHz in LN. ",

The mutual confinement, or trapping, of the subpulses, which leads to a stable propagation of the pulse compound, is enabled by the nonlinear Kerr effect. Special attention is paid to the description of the binding mechanism in terms of attractive potential wells, induced by the refractive index changes of the subpulses, exerted on one another through cross-phase modulation. Specifically, we discuss nonlinear-photonics meta atoms, given by pulse compounds consisting of a strong trapping pulse and a weak trapped pulse, for which trapped states of low intensity are determined by a Schr\\\"odinger-type eigenproblem. We discuss the rich dynamical behavior of such meta-atoms, demonstrating that an increase of the group-velocity mismatch of both subpulses leads to an ionization-like trapping-to-escape transition. We further demonstrate that if both constituent pulses are of similar amplitude, molecule-like bound-states are formed. We show that z-periodic amplitude variations permit a coupling of these pulse compound to dispersive waves, resulting in the resonant emission of Kushi-comb-like multi-frequency radiation. ",

The CSE generates an exact wave function ansatz, constructed from a product of two-body-based non-unitary transformations, that scales polynomially with molecular size and hence, provides a potentially exponential acceleration of classical molecular electronic structure calculations on ideal quantum devices. We demonstrate the algorithm on both quantum simulators and noisy quantum computers with applications to H$_{2}$ dissociation and the rectangle-to-square transition in H$_{4}$. The CSE quantum algorithm, which is a type of contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE), provides a significant step towards realizing verifiably accurate but scalable molecular simulations on quantum devices.

However, it is challenging to achieve large nonreciprocity in miniaturized magnetic thin-film devices because of the difficulty of distinguishing propagating surface spin waves along the opposite directions when the film thickness is small. In this work, we experimentally realize unidirectional microwave transduction with sub-micron-wavelength propagating magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film delay line. We achieve a non-decaying isolation of 30 dB with a broad field-tunable band-pass frequency range up to 14 GHz. The large isolation is due to the selection of chiral magnetostatic surface spin waves with the Oersted field generated from the coplanar waveguide antenna. Increasing the geometry ratio between the antenna width and YIG thickness drastically reduces the nonreciprocity and introduces additional magnon transmission bands. Our results pave the way for on-chip microwave isolation and tunable delay line with short-wavelength magnonic excitations. ",

In this work, we investigate the limits of their classical and near-classical treatment while staying within the framework of quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver. To this end, we consider naive and physically motivated, classically efficient product ansatz for the parametrized wavefunction adapting the separable pair ansatz form. We combine it with post-treatment to account for interactions between subsystems originating from this ansatz. The classical treatment is given by another quantum circuit that has support between the enforced subsystems and is folded into the Hamiltonian. To avoid an exponential increase in the number of Hamiltonian terms, the entangling operations are constructed from purely Clifford or near-Clifford circuits. While Clifford circuits can be simulated efficiently classically, they are not universal. In order to account for missing expressibility, near-Clifford circuits with only few, selected non-Clifford gates are employed. The exact circuit structure to achieve this objective is molecule-dependent and is constructed using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on a set of molecules of interest and investigate the extent of our methodology's reach. Empirical validation of our approach using numerical simulations shows a reduction of the qubit count of up to a 50\\% at a similar accuracy as compared to the separable-pair ansatz. ",

    "abstract": "The optical neural network (ONN) has been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation neurocomputing due to its high parallelism, low latency, and low energy consumption, with significant potential to release unprecedented computational capability. Large-scale ONNs could process more neural information and improve the prediction performance. However, previous ONN architectures based on matrix multiplication are difficult to scale up due to manufacturing limitations, resulting in limited scalability and small input data volumes. To address this challenge, we propose a compact and scalable photonic computing architecture based on temporal photoelectric multiplication and accumulate (MAC) operations, allowing direct processing of large-scale matrix computations in the time domain. By employing a temporal computing unit composed of cascaded modulators and time-integrator, we conduct a series of proof-of-principle experiments including image edge detection, optical neural networks-based recognition tasks, and sliding-window method-based multi-target detection. Thanks to its intrinsic scalability, the demonstrated photonic computing architecture could be easily integrated on a single chip toward large-scale photonic neural networks with ultrahigh computation throughputs.
