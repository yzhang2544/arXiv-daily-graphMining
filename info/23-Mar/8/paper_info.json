    "abstract": "Silicon Dangling Bonds have established themselves as a promising competitor in the field of beyond-CMOS technologies. Their integration density and potential for energy dissipation advantages of several orders of magnitude over conventional circuit technologies sparked the interest of academia and industry alike. While fabrication capabilities advance rapidly and first design automation methodologies have been proposed, physical simulation effectiveness has yet to keep pace. Established algorithms in this domain either suffer from exponential runtime behavior or subpar accuracy levels. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for the physical simulation of Silicon Dangling Bond systems based on statistical methods that offers both a time-to-solution and an accuracy advantage over the state of the art by more than one order of magnitude and a factor of more than three, respectively, as demonstrated by an exhaustive experimental evaluation.

    "abstract": "The Vlasov equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that provides a first-principles description of the dynamics of plasmas. Its linear limit is routinely used in plasma physics to investigate plasma oscillations and stability. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm that simulates the linearized Vlasov equation with and without collisions, in the one-dimensional, electrostatic limit. Rather than solving this equation in its native spatial and velocity phase-space, we adopt an efficient representation in the dual space yielded by a Fourier-Hermite expansion. The Fourier-Hermite representation is exponentially more compact, thus yielding a classical algorithm that can match the performance of a previously proposed quantum algorithm for this problem. This representation results in a system of linear ordinary differential equations which can be solved with well-developed quantum algorithms: Hamiltonian simulation in the collisionless case, and quantum ODE solvers in the collisional case. In particular, we demonstrate that a quadratic speedup in system size is attainable. ",

    "abstract": "Helicenes, a class of organic molecules consisting of ortho-fused benzene rings in a spring-like configuration have found several interesting applications in nonlinear optical materials and opto-electronic devices. Under the action of strain, i.e., via mechanical stretching or compression, the optical absorption spectra of helicenes change which can be employed for strain sensing. The present study presents a detailed investigation of the optical absorption spectra of helicenes using density functional theory along with calculations of the changes in the spectra during mechanical axial stretching or compression of helicenes. The electronic band gap followed a non-symmetric parabolic form with the amount of applied strain. A lowering of the gap in stretched or compressed helicenes compared to the pristine helicene was observed. The compressed state shows a smaller energy gap compared to tension for the same strain magnitude. A detailed inspection of the optical absorption spectra shows that compressive states show significantly lower absorption at higher optical energies (shorter wavelengths) which can provide greater sensitivity to the strain measurement.

Beyond characterizing the system, time and orientation angle dependent expectation values of any relevant operator may be constructed using the LFDM. For example, the time-dependent molecular frame electronic probability density may be constructed, yielding information on charge flow in the molecular frame, and entanglement within the system can be determined.

    "abstract": "The accurate measurement of the net charge on a nanoparticle is critical in both the research and application of nanoparticles. Particularly, in the field of precision sensing based on optically levitated nanoparticles, the precise measurement of the net charge on a nanoparticle is prerequisite for stable levitation before electric control process and for the detecting of quantities such as the electric field. However, the accurate measurement of the net charge on a levitated nanoparticle still faces challenges. Here, we proposes a method to measure the net charge accurately through its thermally and harmonically driven motional signals. With the numerical calculation of the dynamic temperature of the optically-levitated nanoparticle, the long-term dynamic net charge on the nanoparticle can be tracked. This method can achieve an accurate measurement with the accuracy of better than 5% at thermal equilibrium pressures of more than 10 mbar and accuracy of ~20% till 3 mbar, where the net charge barely changes spontaneously, and nonlinearities in the levitated oscillator is relatively small. As the net charge is integer discrete, the method provides nearly completely accurate measurements of nanoparticles with few charges. The result can be applied to improve the measurement accuracy for mass and density through iteration and this method provides a way toward non-contact characterization of aerology, space dust, etc. ",

Over the past decade, GO has emerged as a new frontier material with tremendous advances in its material fabrication and quality control over its properties. These in turn have led to rapid progress in GO based photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics concepts and devices, evoking new science and paving the way for many technological breakthroughs with exceptional performance. Here, we review the unique fundamental characteristics of GO, its thin film fabrication methods, patterning techniques, and mechanisms for tuning its material properties. This latter capability in particular has enabled novel advanced functional photonic, electronic, and optoelectronic devices. Understanding these insights is essential for designing and tailoring GO properties for state-of-the-art applications including solar energy harvesting, energy storage, medical diagnosis, image displays, and optical communications.

    "abstract": "Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs in microresonators has enabled fundamental advances in chip scale precision metrology, communication, spectroscopy, and parallel signal processing. Here we demonstrate polarization diverse soliton transitions and deterministic switching dynamics of a self stabilized microcomb in a strongly coupled dispersion-managed microresonator driven with a single pump laser. The switching dynamics are induced by the differential thermorefractivity between coupled transverse magnetic and transverse electric supermodes during the forward backward pump detunings. The achieved large soliton existence range and deterministic transitions benefit from the switching dynamics, leading to the cross polarized soliton microcomb formation when driven in the transverse magnetic supermode of the single resonator. Resultantly the pump laser always exists at the effective blue detuning of the transverse magnetic resonance, fundamentally mitigating the thermal destabilization barrier and improving accessibility of the soliton formation regime. Subsequently and secondly, we demonstrate two distinct polarization diverse soliton formation routes arising from chaotic or periodically modulated waveforms via pump power selection. The generated self stabilized supermode microcomb features an extraordinarily large soliton existence range, a variety of soliton state transitions with well defined pump laser tuning, high pump microcomb conversion efficiency, and low repetition rate phase noise.

    "title": "Comparing semiclassical mean-field and 1-exciton approximations in  evaluating optical response under strong light-matter coupling conditions",
    "abstract": "The rigorous quantum mechanical description of the collective interaction of many molecules with the radiation field is usually considered numerically intractable, and approximation schemes must be employed. Standard spectroscopy usually contains some levels of perturbation theory, but under strong coupling conditions, other approximations are used. A common approximation is the 1-exciton model in which processes involving weak excitations are described using a basis comprising of the ground state and singly excited states of the molecule cavity-mode system. In another frequently used approximation in numerical investigations, the electromagnetic field is described classically, and the quantum molecular subsystem is treated in the mean-field Hartree approximation with its wavefunction assumed to be a product of single molecules' wavefunctions. The former disregards states that take long time to populate, and is therefore essentially a short time approximation. The latter is not limited in this way, but by its nature, disregards some intermolecular and molecule-field correlations. In this work, we directly compare results obtained from these approximations when applied to several prototype problems involving the optical response of molecule-in-optical cavities systems. In particular, we show that our recent model investigation (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 114108 (2022)) of the interplay between the electronic strong coupling and molecular nuclear dynamics using the truncated 1-exciton approximation agrees very well with the semiclassical mean-field calculation.

Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the mid-IR optical properties of 3D-printed, nanoscale, anisotropic, L-shaped MIM plasmonic cavities. We observe strong vibrational-plasmon coupling between the two dipolar modes of the L-cavity and the polymer dielectric. The resulting three polariton modes are well described by a multimode coupled oscillator model, which we employ to predict the polariton behavior as a function of cavity arm length. The 3D printing technique offers time and cost reduction advantages over typical electron beam lithography and represents a highly accessible and versatile means of printing arbitrary-shaped nanometer-sized mid-IR plasmonic cavities capable of producing strong light-matter interactions for a variety of photonic or photochemical applications.

    "title": "Biasing the quantum vacuum to control macroscopic probability  distributions",
    "abstract": "One of the most important insights of quantum field theory is that electromagnetic fields must fluctuate. Even in the vacuum state, the electric and magnetic fields have a nonzero variance, leading to ubiquitous effects such as spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, the Casimir effect, and more. These \"vacuum fluctuations\" have also been harnessed as a source of perfect randomness, for example to generate perfectly random photonic bits. Despite these achievements, many potential applications of quantum randomness in fields such as probabilistic computing rely on controllable probability distributions, which have not yet been realized on photonic platforms. In this work, we show that the injection of vacuum-level \"bias\" fields into a multi-stable optical system enables a controllable source of \"biased\" quantum randomness. We demonstrate this concept in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Ordinarily, an OPO initiated from the ground state develops a signal field in one of two degenerate phase states (0 and $\\pi$) with equal probability. By injecting bias pulses which contain less than one photon on average, we control the probabilities associated with the two output states, leading to the first controllable photonic probabilistic bit (p-bit). We shed light on the physics behind this process, showing quantitative agreement between theory and experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for sensing sub-photon level fields by showing that our system is sensitive to the temporal shape of bias field pulses far below the single photon level. Our results suggest a new platform for the study of stochastic quantum dynamics in nonlinear driven-dissipative systems, and point toward possible applications in ultrafast photonic probabilistic computing, as well as the sensing of extremely weak fields.

This approach reveals how fruitful these topics are for theoretical physics. Endeavoring to formulate an exhaustive solution to the measurement problem leads us to a better understanding of the status of the collapse and of the emergence of classicality, thanks to a precise definition of the measurement and some new vocabulary to speak of quantum mechanics and decoherence. The result may be seen as a step beyond the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. When the relativistic constraints are added, a consistency condition constraining any relativistic quantum theory is formulated, from which can be deduced the locality of physics as well as, in the context of quantum field theory, the microcausality hypothesis. Moreover, it also implies the non-measurability of fermionic fields. On the way, two different arguments are given to show that a deterministic theory superseding quantum mechanics can not be formulated. ",

We demonstrate the generality of our approach by assembling different macroscopic single-domain photonic crystals with metamaterial properties, like structural coloration, that depend on the underlying crystal structure. By circumventing the fundamental kinetic traps intrinsic to crystallization of optical-scale DNA-coated colloids, we eliminate a key barrier to engineering photonic devices from DNA-programmed materials.
