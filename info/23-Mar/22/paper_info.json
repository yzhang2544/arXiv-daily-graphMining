Recently, tensor network algorithms that can exploit the inherent symmetries of the underlying quantum systems have been proposed to further reduce computational complexity. One class of systems, namely those exhibiting a global U(1) symmetry, is especially interesting.

    "abstract": "Strong laser-driven magnetic fields are crucial for high-energy-density physics and laboratory astrophysics research, but generation of axial multi-kT fields remains a challenge. The difficulty comes from the inability of a conventional linearly polarized laser beam to induce the required azimuthal current or, equivalently, angular momentum (AM). We show that several laser beams can overcome this difficulty. Our three-dimensional kinetic simulations demonstrate that a twist in their pointing directions {enables them to carry orbital AM and transfer it to the plasma, thus generating a hot electron population carrying AM needed to sustain the magnetic field.} The resulting multi-kT field occupies a volume that is tens of thousands of cubic microns and it persists on a ps time scale. The mechanism can be realized for a wide range of laser intensities and pulse durations. Our scheme is well-suited for implementation using {multi-kJ PW-class lasers, because, by design, they have multiple beamlets and because the scheme requires only linear-polarization. ",

    "abstract": "Frequency combs with mode spacing in the range of 10 to 20 gigahertz (GHz) are critical for increasingly important applications such as astronomical spectrograph calibration, high-speed dual-comb spectroscopy, and low-noise microwave generation. While electro-optic modulators and microresonators can provide narrowband comb sources at this repetition rate, a significant remaining challenge is a means to produce pulses with sufficient peak power to initiate nonlinear supercontinuum generation spanning hundreds of terahertz (THz) as required for self-referencing in these applications. Here, we provide a simple, robust, and universal solution to this problem using off-the-shelf polarization-maintaining (PM) amplification and nonlinear fiber components. This fiber-integrated approach for nonlinear temporal compression and supercontinuum generation is demonstrated with a resonant electro-optic frequency comb at 1550 nm. We show how to readily achieve pulses shorter than 60 fs at a repetition rate of 20 GHz and with peak powers in excess of 2 kW. The same technique can be applied to picosecond pulses at 10 GHz to demonstrate temporal compression by a factor of 9x yielding 50 fs pulses with peak power of 5.5 kW. These compressed pulses enable flat supercontinuum generation spanning more than 600 nm after propagation through multi-segment dispersion-tailored anomalous-dispersion highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) or tantala waveguides. The same 10 GHz source can readily achieve an octave-spanning spectrum for self-referencing in dispersion-engineered silicon nitride waveguides. This simple all-fiber approach to nonlinear spectral broadening fills a critical gap for transforming any narrowband 10 to 20 GHz frequency comb into a broadband spectrum for a wide range of applications that benefit from the high pulse rate and require access to the individual comb modes.

Here we develop a wavelength-division multiplexing SPIM to enable programmable spin couplings and external magnetic fields as well for general Ising models. We experimentally demonstrate such a wavelength-division multiplexing SPIM with a single spatial light modulator, where the gauge transformation is implemented to eliminate the impact of pixel alignment. To show the programmable capability of general spin coupling interactions, we explore three spin systems: $\\pm J$ models, Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, and only locally connected ${{J}_{1}}\\texttt{-}{{J}_{2}}$ models and observe the phase transitions between the spin-glass, ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.

The first type (Type I), in which the SERRS spectral envelopes are similar to the plasmon resonance elastic scattering spectra, shows the identical polarization dependence between the SERRS and plasmon resonance. The second type (Type II), in which the SERRS envelopes largely deviate from the plasmon resonance, also exhibits identical polarization dependence. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations indicated that these aggregates were dimers. Thus, this unintuitive result was examined by calculating the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement by changing the morphology of the dimers. The calculation revealed that Type I of dimer generates SERRS directly by superradiant plasmons. The Type II of dimer generates SERRS indirectly by subradiant plasmons, which receive light energy from the superradiant plasmons. This indirect SERRS process clarifies that the interaction between the superradiant and subradiant plasmons results in an identical polarization dependence between SERRS and plasmon resonance for Type II of dimers.

Currently, piezoelectric transducers are the most widely used ultrasound sensors, but their sensitivities drop quickly when the size becomes smaller, leading to a typical sensor size at the millimeter to centimeter scale. In order to realize both high sensitivity and spatial resolution, various optical ultrasound sensors have been developed. Among them, ultrasound sensors using high-$Q$ optical microcavities have realized unprecedented sensitivities and broad bandwidth and can be mass-produced on a silicon chip. In this review, we introduce ultrasound sensors using three types of optical microcavities, including Fabry-Perot cavities, $\\pi$-phase-shifted Bragg gratings, and whispering gallery mode microcavities. We introduce the sensing mechanisms using optical microcavities and discuss several key parameters for ultrasound sensors.

In this study, we investigate the inelastic process of laser photon merging in the collision of just two laser pulses under a finite angle, which provides signal photons of a distinct frequency outside the frequency spectrum of the background. As a key result, for the example of two laser beams of the same oscillation frequency we demonstrate that by using high-intensity optical lasers and choosing an optimal collision angle, photon merging should become accessible in experiment with state-of-the-art technology. In this case three frequency $\\omega$ laser photons are merged to a single $3\\omega$ photon. ",

    "abstract": "Electrically percolating networks made of nanowires are amongst the most promising candidates for next generation transparent electrodes. The inherent heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of current in these materials is at the centre of interest for development as it leads to phenomena like re-routing of the percolation pathways or localized self-heating, which may result in irreversible damage. In the absence of an experimental technique that can spatially resolve the current distribution and a nonlinear percolation model suitable to interpret it, one relies on empirical rules and safety factors to engineer these materials. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum sensing technology as a solution to the long standing problem of imaging active current flow in 2D electrically conductive materials. We report on Bose-Einstein condensate microscopy (BEC-M) achieving the performance and technology levels where investigating the dynamic re-distribution of current pathways in electrically percolating networks becomes feasible. Better measurement and understanding of the networks can have far reaching consequences. We show that the current density characterization, combined with existing thermal imaging methods, will for the first time avoid intermediate assumptions on the link between thermal and conductive properties in these nonlinear networks. This will enable testing and modeling individual junction behaviour and hot spot formation over the network. Investigating reversible and irreversible mechanisms will aid the development of devices with better macroscopic performance and higher stability and reliability. ",

We present a new, open-source software framework, QuantumDynamics.jl, designed to address these challenges. It provides implementations of a variety of perturbative and non-perturbative methods for simulating the dynamics of these sytems. Most prominently, QuantumDynamics.jl supports hierarchical equations of motion and the family of methods based on path integrals. Effort has been made to ensure maximum compatibility of interface between the various methods. Additionally, QuantumDynamics.jl, being built on a high-level programming language, brings a host of modern features to explorations of systems such as usage of Jupyter notebooks and high level plotting for exploration of systems, possibility of leveraging high-performance machine learning libraries for further development. Thus, while the built-in methods can be used as end-points in themselves, the package provides an integrated platform for experimentation, exploration, and method development. ",
