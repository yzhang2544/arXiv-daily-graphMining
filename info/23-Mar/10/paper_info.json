    "abstract": "In this paper we use the effective Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson and square-root Klein-Gordon-Poisson models to study the quantum and relativistic quantum energy band structure of finite temperature electron gas in a neutralizing charge background. Based the plasmon band gap appearing above the Fermi level, new definitions on plasmonic excitations and plasma parameters in a wide electron temperature-density regime is suggested. The new equation of state (EoS) for excited electrons to the plasmon band leads to novel aspects of relativistic collective quantum excitations such as the plasmon black-out and quantum pressure collapse which are studied using both non-relativistic and relativistic quantum models. The plasmon black-out effect may be used to explain why metallic elements do not show collective behavior at low temperatures. The model can be used to predict phases of matter in which the plasmonic activities is shut down, hence, it may behave like a mysterious dark matter. On the other hand, the energy band structure model predicts the plasmon pressure collapse in temperature-density coordinates matching that of a white dwarf star. The prediction of energy band structure of collective quantum excitations may have direct implications for the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), the EoS of warm dense matter (WDM) and evolution of stellar and other unknown cosmological structures. It is found that predictions of non-relativistic and relativistic quantum excitation models closely match up to temperature-density of degenerate stars which confirms the relevance of non-relativistic plasmon models used in the warm and dense matter regime. The effect of positron on band structure of collective quantum excitations is also studied. ",

    "abstract": "As a revolutionary observation tool in life science, biomedical, and material science, optical microscopy allows imaging of samples with high spatial resolution and a wide field of view. However, conventional microscopy methods are limited to single imaging and cannot accomplish real-time image processing. The edge detection, image enhancement and phase visualization schemes have attracted great interest with the rapid development of optical analog computing. The two main physical mechanisms that enable optical analog computing originate from two geometric phases: the spin-redirection Rytov-Vlasimirskii-Berry (RVB) phase and the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase. Here, we review the basic principles and recent research progress of the RVB phase and PB phase based optical differentiators. Then we focus on the innovative and emerging applications of optical analog computing in microscopic imaging. Optical analog computing is accelerating the transformation of information processing from classical imaging to quantum techniques. Its intersection with optical microscopy opens opportunities for the development of versatile and compact optical microscopy systems. ",

    "abstract": "The foundry development of integrated photonics has revolutionized today's optical interconnect and datacenters. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the rising of silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) integrated photonics, which is currently transferring from laboratory research to foundry manufacturing. The development and transition are triggered by the ultimate need of low optical loss offered by Si$_3$N$_4$, which is beyond the reach of silicon and III-V semiconductors. Combined with modest Kerr nonlinearity, tight optical confinement and dispersion engineering, Si$_3$N$_4$ has today become the leading platform for linear and Kerr nonlinear photonics, and has enabled chip-scale lasers featuring ultralow noise on par with table-top fiber lasers. However, so far all the reported fabrication processes of tight-confinement, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuit (PIC) with optical loss down to few dB/m have only been developed on 4-inch or smaller wafers. Yet, to transfer these processes to established CMOS foundries that typically operate 6-inch or even larger wafers, challenges remain. In this work, we demonstrate the first foundry-standard fabrication process of Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC with only 2.6 dB/m loss, thickness above 800 nm, and near 100% fabrication yield on 6-inch wafers. Such thick and ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PIC enables low-threshold generation of soliton frequency combs. Merging with advanced heterogeneous integration, active ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ integrated photonics could pave an avenue to addressing future demands in our increasingly information-driven society.

    "abstract": "The analysis of a chemical reaction along the ground state potential energy surface in conjunction with an unknown spin state is challenging because electronic states must be separately computed several times using different spin multiplicities to find the lowest energy state. However, in principle, the ground state could be obtained with just a single calculation using a quantum computer without specifying the spin multiplicity in advance. In the present work, ground state potential energy curves for PtCO were calculated as a proof-of-concept using a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. This system exhibits a singlet-triplet crossover as a consequence of the interaction between Pt and CO. VQE calculations using a statevector simulator were found to converge to a singlet state in the bonding region, while a triplet state was obtained at the dissociation limit. Calculations performed using an actual quantum device provided potential energies within $\\pm$2 kcal/mol of the simulated energies after adopting error mitigation techniques. The spin multiplicities in the bonding and dissociation regions could be clearly distinguished even in the case of a small number of shots. The results of this study suggest that quantum computing can be a powerful tool for the analysis of the chemical reactions of systems for which the spin multiplicity of the ground state and variations in this parameter are not known in advance.

    "abstract": "Programmability in femtosecond-laser-written integrated circuits is commonly achieved with the implementation of thermal phase shifters. Recent work has shown how such phase shifters display significantly reduced power dissipation and thermal crosstalk with the implementation of thermal isolation structures. However, the aforementioned phase shifter technology is based on a single gold film, which poses severe limitations on integration density and circuit complexity due to intrinsic geometrical constraints. To increase the compactness, we propose two improvements to this technology. Firstly, we fabricated thermal phase shifters with a photolithography process based on two different metal films, namely chromium for microheaters and copper for contact pads and interconnections. Secondly, we developed a novel curved isolation trench design that, along with a state-of-the-art curvature radius, allows for a significant reduction in the optical length of integrated circuits. As a result, curved Cr-Cu phase shifters provide a compact footprint with low parasitic series resistance and no significant increase in power dissipation (~ 38 mW) and thermal crosstalk (~ 20%). These results pave the way toward the fabrication of femtosecond-laser-written photonic circuits with a steep increase in terms of layout complexity. ",

    "abstract": "The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a novel localization phenomenon in certain non-Hermitian systems with gain and/or loss. Most of previous works study the non-Hermitian skin effect in periodic systems. However, electromagnetic waves often propagate within uniform materials without periodic modulation, and it has not been clear whether the optical NHSE occurs in uniform media such as bulk materials and electromagnetic metamaterials. Here we establish the theory of the optical NHSE in non-Hermitian anisotropic media. We show that the NHSE occurs even in uniform media with appropriate anisotropy and material loss. The localization of non-Hermitian skin modes are completely determined by an effective gauge potential caused by the anisotropy of a dielectric tensor. On the basis of the theory, we propose subwavelength multilayer metamaterials as a novel platform for the optical NHSE. We also propose a new concept of stationarily-excited skin modes whose frequencies are forced to be real in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the NHSE occurs even under the condition that the frequency is forced to be real, which implies that the NHSE we propose is observable under stationary excitation. Our work presents a general theory of the NHSE in homogeneous systems, and pave the way to realize the optical NHSE in bulk materials and metamaterials. ",

    "abstract": "Entangled biphoton sources exhibit nonclassical characteristics and have been applied to novel imaging techniques such as ghost imaging, quantum holography, and quantum optical coherence tomography. The development of wide-field quantum imaging to date has been hindered by low spatial resolutions, speeds, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs). Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to 2-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging. QMC advances quantum imaging to the microscopic level with significant improvements in speed and CNR toward bioimaging of cancer cells. We experimentally and theoretically prove that the configuration with balanced pathlengths illuminates an avenue for quantum-enhanced coincidence imaging at the Heisenberg limit. ",

In particular, exact QD states are obtained under certain parameter constraints, providing a guide to finding the respective generic family. In a parameter region of the unbroken PT symmetry, different families of QDs originating from the linear modes are obtained in the form of multipolar and vortex droplets at low and high values of the norm, respectively, and their stability is investigated. In the spinning regime, QDs become asymmetric above a critical rotation frequency, most of them being stable. The effect of the PT -symmetric potential on the spinning and nonspinning QDs is explored by varying the strength of the gain-loss distribution. Generally, spinning QDs trapped in the PT -symmetric potential exhibit asymmetry due to the energy flow affected by the interplay of the gain-loss distribution and rotation. Finally, interactions between spinning or nonspinning QDs are explored, exhibiting elastic collisions under certain conditions. ",
