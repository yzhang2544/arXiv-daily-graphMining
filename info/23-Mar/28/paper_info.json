    "abstract": "Cell pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders has mainly been accessible by analyzing postmortem tissue samples. Although molecular transverse relaxation informs local cellular microenvironment via molecule-environment interactions, precise determination of the transverse relaxation times of molecules with scalar couplings (J), such as glutamate and glutamine, is difficult using current in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technologies, whose approach to measuring transverse relaxation has not changed for decades. We introduce an in vivo MRS technique that achieves chemical shift encoding with selectively locked J-couplings in each column of the acquired two-dimensional dataset, freeing up the entire row dimension for transverse relaxation encoding. This results in increased spectral resolution, minimized background signals, and markedly broadened dynamic range for transverse relaxation encoding. This technique enables determination of the transverse relaxation times of glutamate and glutamine in vivo with unprecedented high precision. Since glutamate predominantly resides in glutamatergic neurons and glutamine in glia in the brain, this noninvasive technique provides a way to probe cellular pathophysiology in neuropsychiatric disorders for characterizing disease progression and monitoring treatment response in a cell type-specific manner in vivo.

    "abstract": "Here we proposed the valley selective excitations via a two-color (\\ensuremath{\\omega} + \\ensuremath{2\\omega}) laser field, made by superimposing two linearly polarized pulses at frequencies \\ensuremath{\\omega} and \\ensuremath{2\\omega}. We have studied the intensity ratio between a few-cycle pulse of \\ensuremath{\\omega} and \\ensuremath{2\\omega} laser, and its enhancement factor by employing the time-dependent first-principle calculations. The valley polarization depends on the carrier envelope phases (CEPs) of pulses and the intensity ratio $I_{\\omega}/I_{2\\omega}$. We found that the two-color field enhances the valley polarization as much as 1.2 times larger than the single-color pulse. The maximum valley asymmetry is achieved for the intensity ratio $I_{\\omega}/I_{2\\omega}$ of 36 with the relative CEP of \\ensuremath{\\pi}. In our previous work, we found that the asymmetric vector potential induces the valley polarization (Phys. Rev. B 105,115403 (2022)). In this work, we find that the asymmetry of the electric field modulates the valley polarization. Our two-color scheme offers a new path toward the optical control of valley pseudospins. \\end{abstract} ",

    "title": "The Wave Energy Density and Growth Rate for the Resonant Instability in  Relativistic Plasmas",
    "abstract": "The wave instability acts in astrophysical plasmas to redistribute energy and momentum in the absence of frequent collisions. There are many different types of waves, and it is important to quantify the wave energy density and growth rate for understanding what type of wave instabilities are possible in different plasma regimes. There are many situations throughout the universe where plasmas contain a significant fraction of relativistic particles. Theoretical estimates for the wave energy density and growth rate are constrained to either field-aligned propagation angles, or non-relativistic considerations. Based on linear theory, we derive the analytic expressions for the energy density and growth rate of an arbitrary resonant wave with an arbitrary propagation angle in relativistic plasmas. For this derivation, we calculate the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of the relativistic-plasma dielectric tensor. We demonstrate that our analytic expression for the wave energy density presents an explicit energy increase of resonant waves in the wavenumber range where the analytic expression for the growth rate is positive (i.e., where a wave instability is driven). For this demonstration, we numerically analyse the loss-cone driven instability, as a specific example, in which the whistler-mode waves scatter relativistic electrons into the loss cone in the radiation belt. Our analytic results further develop the basis for linear theory to better understand the wave instability, and have the potential to combine with quasi-linear theory, which allows to study the time evolution of not only the particle momentum distribution function but also resonant wave properties through an instability.

    "abstract": "Dynamic aperture (DA) is an important nonlinear property of a storage ring lattice, which has a dominant effect on beam injection efficiency and beam lifetime. Generally, minimizing both resonance driving terms (RDTs) and amplitude dependent tune shifts is an essential condition for enlarging the DA. In this paper, we study the correlation between the fluctuation of RDTs along the ring and the DA area with double- and multi-bend achromat lattices. It is found that minimizing the RDT fluctuations is more effective than minimizing RDTs themselves in enlarging the DA, and thus can serve as a very powerful indicator in the DA optimization. Besides, it is found that minimizing lower-order RDT fluctuations can also reduce higher-order RDTs, which are not only more computationally complicated but also more numerous. The effectiveness of controlling the RDT fluctuations in enlarging the DA confirms that the local cancellation of nonlinear effects used in some diffraction-limited storage ring lattices is more effective than the global cancellation.

Consequently, our work establishes a direct measurable signature for band-dressing in nonlinear optical processes in solids, and opens new paths for ultrafast spectroscopy and valley manipulation. ",

    "title": "Nonlocal dynamics of secondary electrons in capacitively coupled radio  frequency discharges",
    "abstract": "In capacitively coupled radio frequency (CCRF) discharges, the interaction of the plasma and the surface boundaries is linked to a variety of highly relevant phenomena for technological processes. One possible plasma-surface interaction is the generation of secondary electrons (SEs), which significantly influence the discharge when accelerated in the sheath electric field. However, SEs, in particular electron-induced SEs ($\\updelta$-electrons), are frequently neglected in theory and simulations. Due to the relatively high threshold energy for the effective generation of $\\updelta$-electrons at surfaces, their dynamics are closely connected and entangled with the dynamics of the ion-induced SEs ($\\upgamma$-electrons). Thus, a fundamental understanding of the electron dynamics has to be achieved on a nanosecond timescale, and the effects of the different electron groups have to be segregated. This work utilizes $1d3v$ Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations of a symmetric discharge in the low-pressure regime ($p\\,=\\, 1\\,\\rm{Pa}$) with the inclusion of realistic electron-surface interactions for silicon dioxide. A diagnostic framework is introduced that segregates the electrons into three groups (\"bulk-electrons\", \"$\\upgamma$-electrons\", and \"$\\updelta$-electrons\") in order to analyze and discuss their dynamics. A variation of the electrode gap size $L_\\mathrm{gap}$ is then presented as a control tool to alter the dynamics of the discharge significantly. It is demonstrated that this control results in two different regimes of low and high plasma density, respectively. The fundamental electron dynamics of both regimes are explained, which requires a complete analysis starting at global parameters (e.g., densities) down to single electron trajectories. ",

The measured conversion efficiency from 1530 nm to 795 nm is independent of l at least in subspace of {-6,...,6}, and the achieved conversion fidelities for two-dimensional (2D) superposed POV states exceed 97%. We further realize the frequency conversion of 3D, 5D and 7D superposition states with fidelities as high as 96.70%, 89.16% and 88.68%, respectively. The reported scheme is implemented in hot atomic vapor, it's also compatible with the cold atomic system and may find applications in high-capacity and long-distance quantum communication. ",

However, widespread applicability of DOEs is still limited, because existing fabrication methods are cumbersome and expensive. Here, we present a simple and cost-effective fabrication approach for solid, high-performance DOEs. The method is based on conjugating two nearly refractive index-matched solidifiable transparent materials. The index matching allows for extreme scaling up of the elements in the axial dimension, which enables simple fabrication of a template using commercially available 3D printing at tens-of-micrometer resolution. We demonstrated the approach by fabricating and using DOEs serving as microlens arrays, vortex plates, including for highly sensitive applications such as vector beam generation and super-resolution microscopy using MINSTED, and phase-masks for three-dimensional single-molecule localization microscopy. Beyond the advantage of making DOEs widely accessible by drastically simplifying their production, the method also overcomes difficulties faced by existing methods in fabricating highly complex elements, such as high-order vortex plates, and spectrum-encoding phase masks for microscopy.

Recently, a voltage-scanning setup was developed and commissioned at CRIS, which improved the scanning speed by a factor of three as compared to the current laser-frequency scanning approach. This leads to faster measurements of the hyperfine structure for systems with high yields (more than a few thousand ions per second). Additionally, several beamline sections have been redesigned and manufactured, including a new field-ionization unit, a sharper electrostatic bend, and improved ion optics. The beamline upgrades are expected to yield an improvement of at least a factor of 5 in the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing the non-resonant laser ions and providing time-of-flight separation between the resonant ions and the collisional background. Overall, the presented developments will further improve the selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency of the CRIS technique. ",

In this study, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally, a unique polarization independent terahertz metamaterial that modulates a broad resonance into a sharp mode by coupling the inherent toroidal dipole excitation to the lattice mode of the metasurface. The advantage of polarization independence in the metasurface enables the excitation of lattice-coupled toroidal mode for both the transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes of the incident terahertz radiation. The interaction of the two dark low-loss modes results in the significant enhancement of the quality factor of the metasurface at the point of resonance matching.

It is far from clear, however, whether entanglement measures, such as the entanglement entropy (EE), can actually be obtained with the precision required to observe these subtle features -- usually in the form of universal finite size scaling behavior -- in highly entangled quantum matter. In the case of 2D interacting fermionic lattice models with gapless spectra, such as in the Hubbard model, the computation of the EE has faced severe limitations, making reliable data in the universal scaling regime off limits to all existing numerical algorithms. Here we explain the reason for the previously unsuccessful attempts in EE computations in quantum Monte Carlo simulations and more importantly, show how to overcome the conceptual and computational barrier with the incremental algorithm[1,2], such that the computation of the EE in 2D interacting fermion systems finally becomes easy and reliable.
