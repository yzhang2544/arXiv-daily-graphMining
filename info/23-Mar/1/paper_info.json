    "abstract": "The interactions between a solid surface and a fluid flow underlie dynamical processes relevant to air, sea, and land vehicle performance and numerous other technologies. Key among these processes are unstable flow disturbances that contribute to fundamental transformations in the flow field. Precise control of these disturbances is possible by introducing a phononic subsurface (PSub). This comprises locally attaching a finite phononic structure perpendicular to an elastic surface exposed to the flowing fluid. This structure experiences ongoing excitation by an unstable flow mode traveling in conjunction with the mean flow. The excitation generates small deformations at the surface that trigger elastic wave propagation within the structure. By targeted tuning of the unit-cell and finite-structure characteristics of the PSub, the returning waves may be devised to resonate and reenter the flow out of phase, leading to significant destructive interference of the incoming flow waves near the surface and subsequently to their attenuation over the spatial extent of the control region. This control mechanism is passive, responsive, and engineered offline without needing coupled fluid-structure simulations; only the flow instability's frequency, wavelength, and overall modal characteristics must be known. We present a PSub in the form of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial, designed to operate in the elastic subwavelength regime and hence being significantly shorter in length compared to a phononic-crystal-based PSub. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of channel flows, both types of PSubs are investigated, and their controlled spatial and energetic influence on the wall-bounded flow behavior is demonstrated and analyzed. We show that the PSub's effect is spatially localized as intended, with a rapidly diminishing streamwise influence away from its location in the subsurface. ",

    "abstract": "The electron density close to the extraction grids and the co-extracted electrons represent a crucial issue when operating negative ion sources for fusion reactors. An excessive electron density in the plasma expansion region can indeed inhibit the negative ion production and introduce potentially harmful electrons in the accelerator. Among the set of plasma and beam diagnostics proposed for SPIDER upgrade, a heterodyne microwave (mw) interferometer at 100 GHz is being explored as a possibility to measure electron density in the plasma extraction region. The major issue in applying this technique in SPIDER is the poor accessibility of the probing microwave beam through the source metal walls and the long distance of 4 m at which mw modules should be located outside the vacuum vessel. Numerical investigations in a full-scale geometry showed that the power transmitted through the plasma source apertures was sufficient for the microwave module sensitivity. An experimental proof-of-principle of the setup was then performed. The microwave system was tested on an experimental full-scale test-bench mimicking SPIDER viewports accessibility constraints, including the presence of a SPIDER-like plasma. The outcome of first tests revealed that, despite the geometrical constraints, in certain conditions, the electron density measurements are possible. The main issue arises from decoupling the one-pass signal from spurious multipaths generated by mw beam reflections, requiring signal cross correlation analysis. These preliminary tests demonstrate that despite the 4 m distance between the mw modules and the presence of metal walls, plasma density measurement is possible when the 80-mm diameter ports are available. In this contribution, we discuss the numerical simulations, the preliminary experimental tests and suggest design upgrades of the interferometric setup to enhance signal transmission. ",

    "abstract": "The spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light generated by tight focusing in optical tweezers has been regularly employed in generating angular momentum - both spin and orbital - in trapped mesoscopic particles. Specifically, the transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM), which arises due to the longitudinal component of the electromagnetic field generated by tight focusing, is of special interest, both in terms of fundamental studies and associated applications. We provide an effective and optimal strategy for generating TSAM in optical tweezers by tightly focusing radially and azimuthally polarized first-order Laguerre Gaussian beams with no intrinsic angular momentum, into a refractive index stratified medium. Our choice of such input fields ensures that the longitudinal spin angular momentum (LSAM) arising from the electric (magnetic) field for the radial (azimuthal) component is zero, which leads to the separate and exclusive effects of the electric and magnetic TSAM in the case of input radially and azimuthally polarized beams on single birefringent particles. We also observe the emergence of origin-dependent intrinsic orbital angular momentum causing the rotation of birefringent particles around the beam axis for both input beam types, which opens up new and simple avenues for exotic and complex particle manipulation in optical tweezers.

    "abstract": "On the way to advance the sensing technology, various strategies based on the nano-materials have been introduced to improve the performance of the gas sensors. In this study, we have introduced a facile fabrication procedure for annealing hematite to monitor ethanol gas. Due to large specific area of this conductive platform, more available target molecules (ethanol gas) are detected. To construct this platform, initially, a large scale well-separated iron oxide (hematite) nanostructures are created via an annealing process. The morphology of the nanostructure is optimized through annealing temperature and operating temperature for ethanol gas. The best response for the gas sensor is achieved for hematite nanostructures fabricated through the annealing temperature of 500{\\deg}C and the operating temperature of 225$^\\circ$C. The fabricated nanostructures is tested in air ambient conditions for various ethanol gas concentrations from 50 to 1000 ppm. The modified sensor exhibited acceptable reproducibility and good selectivity with no interference-effect. To examine the X-ray diffraction patterns of hematite nanostructures at three annealed temperatures, the Rietveld method and FullProf software are used in which the average crystal size has been obtained. Obviously, with increasing the annealing temperature, the average size of the crystals has been increased. The results of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy show that the energy gap decreased with increasing annealing temperature. The maximum sensing response of hematite flower-like nanostructures is obtained at a concentration of 1000 ppm. Also, the shortest response time is estimated at about 27 seconds for ethanol at a concentration of 200 ppm. The detection limit of this sensor is obtained at 50 ppm. ",

This paper reviews characteristics of the direct photodetection of optical pulses for the intent of generating high power, low phase noise microwave signals from optical sources. The two most popular types of photodiode detectors used for low noise microwave generation are discussed in terms of electrical pulse characteristics, achievable microwave power, and photodetector nonlinearities. Noise sources inherent to photodetection, such as shot noise, flicker noise, and photocarrier scattering are reviewed, and their impact on microwave phase fidelity is discussed. General guidelines for attaining the lowest noise possible from photodetection that balances power saturation, optical amplification, and amplitude-to-phase conversion, are also presented. ",

Various channels are then combined in a digital computer using filter bank theory to improve the sampling rate . The combination of multiple channels allows for increasing the axial resolution and maximum unambiguous range beyond the Nyquist limit. We then simulate the multirate spectral domain optical coherence tomography with 2 channels. We show that a single delay line can improve the axial resolution while a pair of phase modulators can improve the maximum unambiguous range of the system. We also show the use of multirate filter banks to carry out this process. Thus, by using a few extra components in the spectral domain optical coherence tomography, its performance can be increased manifold de-pending on the number of channels used. The extra cost is the time taken to perform the extra scans that is trivial for stationary objects like biological tissues. ",

Conventional annealing methods are often insufficient to locally achieve the desired properties for a narrow parameter range. In this study, we report a significant improvement of the magnetic softness and magnetostriction in a 30 nm Permalloy film after He$^+$ irradiation. Compared to the as-deposited state, the irradiation treatment reduces the induced anisotropy by a factor ten and the hard axis coercivity by a factor five. In addition, the effective magnetostriction of the film is significantly reduced by a factor ten - below $1\\times10^{-7}$ - after irradiation. All the above mentioned effects can be attributed to the isotropic crystallite growth of the Ni-Fe alloy and to the intermixing at the magnetic layer interfaces under light ion irradiation. We support our findings with X-ray diffraction analysis of the textured Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ alloy. Importantly, the sizable magnetoresistance is preserved after the irradiation. Our results show that compared to traditional annealing methods, the use of He$^+$ irradiation leads to significant improvements in the magnetic softness and reduces strain cross sensitivity in Permalloy films required for 3D positioning and compass applications. These improvements, in combination with the local nature of the irradiation process make our finding valuable for the optimization of monolithic integrated sensors, where classic annealing methods cannot be applied due to complex interplay within the components in the device.

Such loss is within the tolerance of the commercial optical communication modules, and without the need of optical amplifiers, which contributes to the low system weight and power consumption. As a result, a single FSO device weighs only about 12 kg, making it compact and portable for potential application in high-speed wireless communication.

    "title": "Quantum simulation of the central spin model with a Rydberg atom and  polar molecules in optical tweezers",
    "abstract": "Central spin models, where a single spinful particle interacts with a spin environment, find wide application in quantum information technology and can be used to describe, e.g., the decoherence of a qubit over time. We propose a method of realizing an ultracold quantum simulator of a central spin model with XX (spin-exchanging) interactions. The proposed system consists of a single Rydberg atom (\"central spin\") and surrounding polar molecules (\"bath spins\"), coupled to each other via dipole-dipole interactions. By mapping internal particle states to spin states, spin-exchanging interactions can be simulated. As an example system geometry, we consider a ring-shaped arrangement of bath spins, and show how it allows to exact precise control over the interaction strengths. We demonstrate that this setup allows to realize a central spin model with highly tunable parameters and geometry, for applications in quantum science and technology. ",
