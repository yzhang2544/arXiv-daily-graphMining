    "abstract": "We present a tunable metal ion beam that delivers controllable ion currents in the picoamp range for testing of dry-phase ion sensors. Ion beams are formed by sequential atomic evaporation and single or multiple electron impact ionization, followed by acceleration into a sensing region. Controllability of the ionic charge state is achieved through tuning of electrode potentials that influence the retention time in the ionization region. Barium, lead, and cobalt samples have been used to test the system, with ion currents identified and quantified using a quadrupole mass analyzer. Realization of a clean $\\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ ion beam within a bench-top system represents an important technical advance toward the development and characterization of barium tagging systems for neutrinoless double beta decay searches in xenon gas. This system also provides a testbed for investigation of novel ion sensing methodologies for environmental assay applications, with dication beams of Pb$^{2+}$ and Cd$^{2+}$ also demonstrated for this purpose.

    "abstract": "We investigate ultrafast harmonic generation (HG) in Si:B, driven by intense pump pulses with fields reaching ~100 kV/cm and a carrier frequency of 300 GHz, at 4 K and 300 K, both experimentally and theoretically. We report several novel findings concerning the nonlinear charge carrier dynamics in intense sub-THz fields. (i) Harmonics of order up to n=9 are observed at room temperature, while at low temperature we can resolve harmonics reaching even n=13. The susceptibility per charge carrier at moderate field strength is as high as for charge carriers in graphene, considered to be one of the materials with the strongest sub-THz nonlinear response. (ii) For T=300 K, where the charge carriers bound to acceptors are fully thermally ionized into the valence subbands, the susceptibility values decrease with increasing field strength. Simulations incorporating multi-valence-band Monte-Carlo and finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) propagation show that here, the HG process becomes increasingly dominated by energy-dependent scattering rates over the contribution from band non-parabolicity, due to the onset of optical-phonon emission, which ultimately leads to the saturation at high fields. (iii) At T=4 K, where the majority of charges are bound to acceptors, we observe a drastic rise of the HG yields for internal pump fields of 30 kV/cm, as one reaches the threshold for tunnel ionization. We disentangle the HG contributions in this case into contributions from the initial 'generational'- and subsequent band-nonlinearities, and show that scattering seriously degrades any coherent recollision during the subsequent oscillation of the holes.

Nanophotonic waveguides and integrated couplers have been developed to achieve selective coupling and spatial control of an optical beam according to its multiple degrees of freedom. However, previous coupling devices remain passive with an inherently linear response to the power of incident light limiting their maximal optical selectivity. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear optical selectivity through selective excitation of individual single-mode nanolasers based on the spin and orbital angular momentum of light. Our designed nanolaser circuits consist of plasmonic metasurfaces and individual perovskite nanowires, enabling subwavelength focusing of angular-momentum-distinctive plasmonic fields and further selective excitation of single transverse laser modes in nanowires. The optically selected nanolaser with nonlinear increase of light emission greatly enhances the baseline optical selectivity offered by the metasurface from about 0.4 up to near unity. Our demonstrated nonlinear optical selectivity may find important applications in all-optical logic gates and nanowire networks, ultrafast optical switches, nanophotonic detectors, and on-chip optical and quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical method based on the variational quantum algorithm to solve potential and Stokes flow problems. In this method, the governing equations for potential and Stokes flows can be respectively written in the form of Laplace's equation and Stokes equations using velocity potential, stream function and vorticity formulations. Then the finite difference method and the generalised differential quadrature (GDQ) method are applied to discretize the governing equations. For the prescribed boundary conditions, the corresponding linear systems of equations can be obtained. These linear systems are solved by using the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), which resolves the potential and Stokes flow problems equivalently. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates the GDQ method which is inherently a high-order discretization method with the VQLS algorithm. Since the GDQ method can utilize much fewer grid points than the finite difference method to approximate derivatives with a higher order of accuracy, the size of the input matrix for the VQLS algorithm can be smaller. In this way, the computational cost may be saved. The performance of the present method is comprehensively assessed by two representative examples, namely, the potential flow around a circular cylinder and Stokes flow in a lid-driven cavity. Numerical results validate the applicability and accuracy of the present VQLS-based method. Furthermore, its time complexity is evaluated by the heuristic scaling, which demonstrates that the present method scales efficiently in the number of qubits and the precision. This work brings quantum computing to the field of computational fluid dynamics. By virtue of quantum advantage over classical methods, promising advances in solving large-scale fluid mechanics problems of engineering interest may be prompted. ",

Based on this approach, we demonstrate and verify TFLN waveguide crossings with insertion losses of < 0.070 dB and crosstalk of < -50 dB along all three routing directions at 1550 nm. The low-loss and low-crosstalk waveguide crossings in this work, together with the simple and efficient characterization strategy, could provide important layout design flexibility for future large-scale classical and quantum TFLN photonic circuits.

However, its counter-intuitive quantum nature makes it challenging to gain insights into its dynamics, particularly in complex systems. Simulation is a promising tool to resolve this issue, but previous methods are limited by the curse of dimensionality in which the number of bases increases exponentially in the number of photons. Here, we overcome this dimensionality challenge by focusing on optical detection setups composed of linear optical objects and by reducing computational costs to be linear in the number of photons. We apply this method to basic single- and multi-photon phenomena, such as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality, and confirm that the calculated properties are quantitatively comparable to the experimental results. Furthermore, our method visualizes the spatial propagation of photons hence provides insights that aid experiment designs for quantum-enabled technologies. ",

With the advent of high-resolution image sensors and colour filter technologies, multispectral imagers in the visible wavelengths have become popular with increasing commercial viability in the last decade. However, multispectral imaging in longwave infrared (LWIR: 8 to 14 microns) is still an emerging area due to the limited availability of optical materials, filter technologies, and high-resolution sensors. Images from LWIR multispectral cameras can capture emission spectra of objects to extract additional information that a human eye fails to capture and thus have important applications in precision agriculture, forestry, medicine, and object identification. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an LWIR multispectral image sensor with three wavelength bands using optical elements made of an aluminum-based plasmonic filter array sandwiched in germanium. To realize the multispectral sensor, the filter arrays are then integrated into a 3D printed wheel stacked on a low-resolution monochrome thermal sensor. Our prototype device is calibrated using a blackbody and its thermal output has been enhanced with computer vision methods. By applying a state-of-the-art deep learning method, we have also reconstructed multispectral images to a better spatial resolution. Scientifically, our work demonstrates a versatile spectral thermography technique for detecting target signatures in the LWIR range and other advanced spectral analyses. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields, including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy. ",

Two laser beams are used, one as a source to locally modulate the sample temperature, and the other as a probe of sample reflectivity, which is a function of the modulated temperature. Thermal diffusivity is obtained from the phase delay between source and probe signals. We combine this technique with a microscope setup in an optical cryostat, in which the sample is placed on a 3-axis piezo-stage, allowing for spatially resolved measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally and mathematically that isotropic in-plane diffusivity can be obtained when overlapping the two laser beams instead of separating them in the traditional way, which further enhances the spatial resolution to a micron scale, especially valuable when studying inhomogeneous or multidomain samples. We discuss in detail the experimental conditions under which this technique is valuable, and demonstrate its performance on two stoichiometric bilayer ruthenates: Sr3Ru2O7 and Ca3Ru2O7. The spatial resolution allowed us to study the diffusivity in single domains of the latter, and we uncovered a temperature-dependent in-plane diffusivity anisotropy. Finally, we used the enhanced spatial resolution enabled by overlapping the two beams to measure temperature-dependent diffusivity of Ti-doped Ca3Ru2O7, which exhibits a metal-insulator transition. We observed large variations of transition temperature over the same sample, originating from doping inhomogeneity, and pointing to the power of spatially resolved techniques in accessing inherent properties.

    "title": "The ideal wavelength for daylight free-space quantum key distribution",
    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) has matured in recent years from laboratory proof-of-principle demonstrations to commercially available systems. One of the major bottlenecks is the limited communication distance in fiber networks due to the exponential signal damping. To bridge intercontinental distances, low Earth orbit satellites transmitting the quantum signals over the atmosphere can be used. These free-space links, however, can only operate during the night, as the sunlight otherwise saturates the detectors used to measure the quantum states. For applying QKD in a global quantum internet with continuous availability and high data rates, operation during daylight is required. In this work, we model a satellite-to-ground quantum channel for different quantum light sources to identify the optimal wavelength for free-space QKD in ambient conditions. Daylight quantum communication is possible within the Fraunhofer lines or in the near-infrared spectrum, where the intrinsic background from the sun is comparably low. The highest secret key rate is achievable at the Ca II Fraunhofer line. We also propose a true single photon source based on a color center in hexagonal boron nitride coupled to a microresonator that can implement such a scheme. Our results can also be applied in roof-to-roof scenarios and are therefore relevant for near-future quantum networks. ",
