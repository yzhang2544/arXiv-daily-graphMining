Compared to twisted two-dimensional materials, twisted bilayer photonic crystals host a rich set of physics and provide a much larger number of degrees of freedom choice of material, lattice symmetry, feature size, twist angle, and interlayer gap, which promises an unprecedented toolbox for tailoring optical properties. We directly visualize the dispersion throughout the optical frequency range and show that the measured optical response is in good quantitative agreement with numerical and analytical results.

Here, we theoretically investigate the nonlinear optics that emerge as a result of photothermal effects in a multimode optical system composed of two cavity modes coupled via hopping coefficient and with two mechanical modes through coupling rates. We report single to double photothermally-induced transparency (PTIT) dips, and a single sharp photothermally-induced absorption (PTIA) peak, and demonstrate that photothermal and strong coupling coefficients can suppress this phenomenon. Moreover, we observe Fano resonances in the absorption profile by monitoring probe transmission in the off-resonant configuration of the transparency phenomenon. The dynamics of group delay or advance are investigated in the range of transparency such that a sharp dip can assist in achieving slow light for a longer time. Using appropriate experimental parameters, our proposed work can pave the way for future practical applications in quantum information processing based on multimode interactions. ",

In strong-field physics, motion of electrons is mainly confined in transverse plane of light fields, which suppresses the significance of nondipole effects. Here, we present a theoretical study on enhancing and controlling the nondipole effect by using the synthesized two perpendicularly propagating laser fields. We calculate the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distributions of strong-field tunneling ionization of hydrogen atoms using the classical trajectory Monte Carlo model and show that the nondipole effects are noticeably enhanced in such laser fields due to their remarkable influences on the sub-cycle photoelectron dynamics. In particular, we reveal that the magnitudes of the magnetic and electric components of nondipole effects can be separately controlled by modulating the ellipticity and amplitude of driving laser fields.

The trap stiffness was characterized for various different parameters such as the bead radius, the laser power and the distance between the bead and the coverslip of the sample chamber, attesting the viability of using such material for optical manipulation. Since the effective optical properties of PANI can be modulated by the synthesis process, new related applications are also proposed.

Here we show in theory and experiment that a digitally space-time-coded metamaterial (MTM) antenna with spatiotemporal modulation at its unit cell level can be regarded as a radiating counterpart of such digital metasurface, which will enable nonreciprocal EM wave transmission and reception via surface-to-leaky-wave transformation and harmonic frequency generation. Operating in the fast wave (radiation) region, the space-time-coded MTM antenna is tailored in a way such that the propagation constant of each programmable unit cell embedded with varactor diodes can toggle between positive and negative phases, which is done through providing digital sequences by using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Owing to the time-varying coding sequence, harmonic frequencies are generated with different main beam directions. Furthermore, the space time modulation of the digitally coded MTM antenna allows for nonreciprocal transmission and reception of EM waves by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, which may enable many applications, such as simultaneous transmit and receive, unidirectional transmission, radar sensing, and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) beamformer.

    "abstract": "The generation of spectrally pure high-frequency microwave signals is a critical functionality in fundamental and applied sciences, including metrology and communications. The development of optical frequency combs has enabled the powerful technique of optical frequency division (OFD) to produce microwave oscillations of the highest quality. The approaches for OFD demonstrated to date demand multiple lasers with space- and energy-consuming optical stabilization and electronic feedback components, resulting in device footprints incompatible with integration into a compact and robust photonic platform. Here, we demonstrate all-optical OFD on a single photonic chip driven with a single continuous-wave laser. We generate a dual-point frequency reference using the beat frequency of the signal and idler fields from a microresonator-based optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which achieves high phase stability due to the inherently strong signal-idler frequency correlations. We implement OFD by optically injecting the signal and idler fields from the OPO to a Kerr-comb microresonator on the same chip. We show that the two distinct dynamical states of Kerr cavities can be passively synchronized, allowing broadband frequency locking of the comb state, which transfers the stability of the OPO frequencies to the repetition rate of the Kerr comb. A 630-fold phase-noise reduction is observed when the Kerr comb is synchronized to the OPO, which represents the lowest noise generated on the silicon-nitride platform. Our work demonstrates a simple, effective approach for performing OFD and provides a pathway toward chip-scale devices that can generate microwave frequencies comparable to the purest tones produced in metrological laboratories. This technology can significantly boost the further development of data communications and microwave sensing. ",

To enable an improved understanding of SiC-SiC composite performance, the development of non-destructive evaluation techniques to assess critical defects is needed. Three-dimensional (3D) X-ray imaging, also referred to as X-ray computed tomography (CT), is a non-destructive, data-rich characterization technique that can provide surface and subsurface spatial information. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a fully automatic workflow to detect and analyze SiC-SiC defects using image processing techniques on 3D X-ray images. The workflow consists of four processing blocks, including data preparation, void/crack detection, visualization, and analysis. In this work, three SiC samples (two irradiated and one unirradiated) provided by General Atomics are investigated. The irradiated samples were exposed in a way that was expected to induce cracking, and indeed, the automated workflow developed in this work was able to successfully identify and characterize the crack formation in the irradiated samples while detecting no observed cracking in the unirradiated sample. These results demonstrate the value of automated XCT tools to better understand the damage and damage propagation in SiC-SiC structures for nuclear applications. ",

The aim of this study is to assess the frequency content and characteristics of head kinematic signals from head impact reconstruction laboratory and field-based environments to develop an artefact attenuation filtering method (artefact attenuation method). Laboratory impacts (n=72) on a test-dummy headform ranging from 25-150 g were conducted and 126 elite-level rugby union players were equipped with instrumented mouthguards (iMG) for up to four matches. Power spectral density (PSD) characteristics of the laboratory impacts and on-field HAE (n=5694) such as the 95th percentile cumulative sum PSD frequency were utilised to develop the artefact attenuation method. The artefact attenuation method was compared to two other common filtering approaches (Fourth order (2x2 pole), zero-lag Butterworth filter with 200 Hz (-6 dB) cut-off frequency (Butterworth-200Hz) and CFC180 filter) through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mixed linear effects models for laboratory and on-field events, respectively. The artefact attenuation method produced an overall higher SNR than the Butterworth-200Hz and CFC180 filter and on-field peak linear acceleration (PLA) and peak angular acceleration (PAA) values within the magnitude range tested in the laboratory. Median PLA and PAA were higher for the CFC180 filter than the Butterworth-200Hz (p<0.01) and artefact attenuation method (p<0.01), reporting values as high as 294 g and 31.2 krad/s2. The artefact attenuation method can be applied to all commercially available iMG kinematic signals with adequate sample rates to enable field-based inter-study comparisons. ",

    "abstract": "Molecular laser cooling and trapping requires addressing all spontaneous decays to excited vibrational states that occur at the $\\gtrsim 10^{-4} - 10^{-5}$ level, which is accomplished by driving repumping transitions out of these states. However, the transitions must first be identified spectroscopically at high-resolution. A typical approach is to prepare molecules in excited vibrational states via optical cycling and pumping, which requires multiple high-power lasers. Here, we demonstrate a general method to perform this spectroscopy without the need for optical cycling. We produce molecules in excited vibrational states by using optically-driven chemical reactions in a cryogenic buffer gas cell, and implement frequency-modulated absorption to perform direct, sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate this technique by measuring the spectrum of the $\\tilde{A}^2\\Pi_{1/2}(1,0,0)-\\tilde{X}^2\\Sigma^+(3,0,0)$ band in $^{174}$YbOH. We identify the specific vibrational repump transitions needed for photon cycling, and combine our data with previous measurements of the $\\tilde{A}^2\\Pi_{1/2}(1,0,0)-\\tilde{X}^2\\Sigma^+(0,0,0)$ band to determine all of the relevant spectral constants of the $\\tilde{X}^2\\Sigma^+(3,0,0)$ state.

According to the OPA working principle, its function is generally achieved by independently controlling the phase of the array elements. In practice, this presents a major challenge to overcome critical trade-offs of the element numbers, the control electronics, and the power consumption. Here, we give an alternative OPA solution to overcome this technical limitation, in the form of a cascaded periodically poled electro-optical crystal structure. Compared with the existing OPA scheme, only one control electronics is used to control the entire array elements in the current proposal, regardless of the number of array elements, implying higher integration and lower power consumption. With the help of the fast response properties of electro-optic crystal materials, a high-speed and high-resolution beam steering device is demonstrated. Simulating results show that the angular resolution can be improved by several orders of magnitude when the number of the cascaded-layer increases. An OPA prototype of a 6-layer cascaded periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ (cascaded-PPLN) was designed, fabricated, and characterized. The experiment that observed beam deflection in cascaded-PPLN OPA agrees well with the simulation results. Meantime, by demonstrating dynamic beam steering continually, its capability of continuous scanning and continually active phase tunability has been verified. Therefore, this cascaded periodically poled electro-optical crystal OPA offers a feasible direction of miniaturization and low power consumption for the optical system, such as the PIC system. ",

    "title": "On the impact of short laser pulses on cold diluted plasmas",
    "abstract": "We analytically study the impact of a (possibly, very intense) short laser pulse onto a cold diluted plasma at rest. Choosing the $\\vec{z}$-axis in the propagation direction, if the pulse profile and the initial plasma density (IPD) depend only on $z$, then suitable matched bounds on the maximum and the relative variations of the IPD, as well as the intensity and duration of the pulse, ensure a strictly hydrodynamic evolution of the electron fluid during its whole interaction with the pulse, while ions can be regarded as immobile. This evolution is ruled by a family (parametrized by $Z\\ge 0$) of decoupled systems of non-autonomous Hamilton equations with 1 degree of freedom, which determine how electrons initially located in the layer $Z\\le z<Z+dZ$ move; $\\xi=ct-z$ replaces time $t$ as the independent variable. This family of ODEs is obtained by reduction from the Lorentz-Maxwell and continuity PDEs for the electrons' fluid within the spacetime region where depletion of the pulse is negligible. After the laser-plasma interaction the Jacobian of the map from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates is \"linear-quasi-periodic\" in $\\xi$. We determine spacetime locations and features of the first wave-breakings of the wakefield plasma wave (PW), the motion of test electrons (self-)injected in the PW. The energy of those trapped in a single PW trough grows linearly with the distance gone; in our model such electrons cannot dephase, as the PW has phase velocity $c$. If the impacting laser pulse is symmetric around the $\\vec{z}$-axis and has a not too small radius $R$, the same conclusions hold for the part of the plasma close to $\\vec{z}$ and enclosed within the causal cone swept by the pulse. This computationally light approach may help in a preliminary study of extreme acceleration mechanisms of electrons, before 2D or 3D PIC simulations. ",

    "title": "Observation of higher-order topological states on a quantum computer",
    "abstract": "Programmable quantum simulators such as superconducting quantum processors and ultracold atomic lattices represent rapidly developing emergent technology that may one day qualitatively outperform existing classical computers. Yet, apart from a few breakthroughs, the range of viable computational applications with current-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is still significantly limited by gate errors, quantum decoherence and the number of high quality qubits. In this work, we develop an approach that places NISQ hardware as particularly suitable platforms for simulating multi-dimensional condensed matter systems, including lattices beyond three dimensions which are difficult to realize or probe in other settings. By fully exploiting the exponentially large Hilbert space of a quantum chain, we encoded a high-dimensional model in terms of non-local many-body interactions that can further be systematically transcribed into quantum gates. We demonstrate the power of our approach by realizing, on IBM transmon-based quantum computers, higher-order topological states in up to four dimensions, which are exotic phases that have never been realized in any quantum setting. With the aid of in-house circuit compression and error mitigation techniques, we measured the topological state dynamics and their protected midgap spectra to a high degree of accuracy, as benchmarked by reference exact diagonalization data. The time and memory needed with our approach scales favorably with system size and dimensionality compared to exact diagonalization on classical computers. ",

    "abstract": "In deriving the formula for spontaneous emission rate, typical textbooks often use physically motivated but mathematically unjustified (and sometimes even contradictory) approximations. The commonly used dipole approximation applied to the entire frequency spectrum results in the appearance of divergent integrals in the derivations. It is known from the literature that the introduction of cutoff for frequencies, justified by the finite size of the atom, may solve this problem. For didactic purposes, we introduce a mathematically simple cutoff, which allows for a rigorous rederivation of Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission formula. Importantly, this is not a mathematical trick to make calculations easier but is related to a real feature of the physical system, the neglect of which leads to inconsistency. ",

    "abstract": "A high-efficiency spin-photon interface is an essential piece of quantum hardware necessary for various quantum technologies. Self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots have excellent optical properties, if embedded into an optical micro-cavity they can show near-deterministic spin-photon entanglement and spin readout, but an external magnetic field is required to address the individual spin states, which usually is done using a superconducting magnet. Here, we show a compact cryogenically compatible SmCo magnet design that delivers 475 mT in-plane Voigt geometry magnetic field at 5 K, which is suitable to lift the energy degeneracy of the electron spin states and trion transitions of a single InGaAs quantum dot. This quantum dot is embedded in a birefringent high-finesse optical micro-cavity which enables efficient collection of single photons emitted by the quantum dot. We demonstrate spin-state manipulation by addressing the trion transitions with a single and two laser fields. The experimental data agrees well to our model which covers single- and two-laser cross-polarized resonance fluorescence, Purcell enhancement in a birefringent cavity, and variation of the laser powers.

    "title": "Quantum time reflection and refraction of ultracold atoms",
    "abstract": "Time reflection and refraction are temporal analogies of the spatial boundary effects derived from Fermat's principle. They occur when classical waves strike a time boundary where an abrupt change in the properties of the medium is introduced. The main features of time-reflected and refracted waves are the shift of frequency and conservation of momentum, which offer a new degree of freedom for steering extreme waves and controlling phases of matter. The concept was originally proposed for manipulating optical waves more than five decades ago. However, due to the extreme challenges in the ultrafast engineering of the optical materials, the experimental realization of the time boundary effects remains elusive. Here, we introduce a time boundary into a momentum lattice of ultracold atoms and simultaneously demonstrate the time reflection and refraction experimentally. Through launching a Gaussian-superposed state into the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) atomic chain, we observe the time-reflected and refracted waves when the input state strikes a time boundary. Furthermore, we detect a transition from time reflection/refraction to localization with increasing strength of disorder and show that the time boundary effects are robust against considerable disorder. Our work opens a new avenue for future exploration of time boundaries and spatiotemporal lattices, and their interplay with non-Hermiticity and many-body interactions. ",
