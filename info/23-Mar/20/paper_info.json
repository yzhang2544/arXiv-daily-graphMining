    "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in the research on self-assembled nanotechnological building blocks such as macromolecules, nanowires, and two-dimensional materials, synthetic self-assembly methods bridging nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions remain unscalable and inferior to biological self-assembly. In contrast, planar semiconductor technology has had an immense technological impact owing to its inherent scalability, yet it appears unable to reach the atomic dimensions enabled by self-assembly. Here we use surface forces including Casimir-van der Waals interactions to deterministically self-assemble and self-align suspended silicon nanostructures with void features well below the length scales possible with conventional lithography and etching, despite using nothing more than conventional lithography and etching. The method is remarkably robust and the threshold for self-assembly depends monotonically on all governing parameters across thousands of measured devices. We illustrate the potential of these concepts by fabricating nanostructures, which are impossible to make with any other known method: Waveguide-coupled high-Q silicon photonic cavities that confine telecom photons to 2 nm air gaps with an aspect ratio of 100, corresponding to mode volumes more than 100 times below the diffraction limit. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements confirm the ability to build devices even with subnanometer dimensions. Our work constitutes the first steps towards a new generation of fabrication technology that combines the atomic dimensions enabled by self-assembly with the scalability of planar semiconductors. ",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest average power from a 100-fs class mode-locked laser based on a Tm3+ or Ho3+ doped bulk material. We show that the laser has excellent noise properties with an integrated relative intensity noise of 0.02% and a timing jitter of 950 fs (RMS phase noise 0.543 mrad) in the integration interval from 10 Hz to 10 MHz.

    "title": "Rapid Sensing of Hidden Objects and Defects using a Single-Pixel  Diffractive Terahertz Processor",
    "abstract": "Terahertz waves offer numerous advantages for the nondestructive detection of hidden objects/defects in materials, as they can penetrate through most optically-opaque materials. However, existing terahertz inspection systems are restricted in their throughput and accuracy (especially for detecting small features) due to their limited speed and resolution. Furthermore, machine vision-based continuous sensing systems that use large-pixel-count imaging are generally bottlenecked due to their digital storage, data transmission and image processing requirements. Here, we report a diffractive processor that rapidly detects hidden defects/objects within a target sample using a single-pixel spectroscopic terahertz detector, without scanning the sample or forming/processing its image. This terahertz processor consists of passive diffractive layers that are optimized using deep learning to modify the spectrum of the terahertz radiation according to the absence/presence of hidden structures or defects. After its fabrication, the resulting diffractive processor all-optically probes the structural information of the sample volume and outputs a spectrum that directly indicates the presence or absence of hidden structures, not visible from outside. As a proof-of-concept, we trained a diffractive terahertz processor to sense hidden defects (including subwavelength features) inside test samples, and evaluated its performance by analyzing the detection sensitivity as a function of the size and position of the unknown defects. We validated its feasibility using a single-pixel terahertz time-domain spectroscopy setup and 3D-printed diffractive layers, successfully detecting hidden defects using pulsed terahertz illumination. This technique will be valuable for various applications, e.g., security screening, biomedical sensing, quality control, anti-counterfeiting measures and cultural heritage protection. ",

    "abstract": "Certain point defects in solids can efficiently be used as qubits for applications in quantum technology. They have spin states that are initializable, readable, robust, and can be manipulated optically. New theoretical methods are needed to find the best host materials and defect configurations. Most methods proposed so far rely either on cluster models or restrict the many-body treatment of the defects to a subspace of single-particle orbitals. We explore best practices and theory for the use of quantum Monte Carlo to predict the excitation spectra for spin defects, by using the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) center in diamond as a test system. Quantum Monte Carlo can be used to explicitly simulate electronic correlations with larger systems and sets of orbitals than previous methods due to favourable scaling with respect to system size and computing power. We consider different trial wave functions for variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, explore the nodal surface errors of the ground and excited state wave functions and study whether the variational principle holds for the excited states. We compute the vertical excitation energies in different simulation cell sizes and extrapolate to infinite system size, and include backflow corrections to the extrapolated energies. The final results for vertical excitation energies are found to overestimate the experimental estimates, but the triplet-to-triplet and singlet-to-singlet transitions are accurate against experiment. Finally, we list further developments for QMC needed to address the problem of accurately predicting structural and spin properties of the solid-state defects. ",

First of all, information is given about the working principle of the antenna, the selected dielectric layer and the working frequency. Schematic drawings of the designed antenna were made from above and from the side. S11 characteristic graphs are drawn below and above the operating frequency. The radiation pattern is drawn for the E-plane and H-plane at the operating frequency. 3-D (dimensional) plot of antenna gain at operating frequency is drawn.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new five-point targeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme with adaptive dissipation is proposed. With the standard TENO weighting strategy, the cut-off parameter $C_T$ determines the nonlinear numerical dissipation of the resultant TENO scheme. Moreover, according to the dissipation-adaptive TENO5-A scheme, the choice of the cut-off parameter $C_T$ highly depends on the effective scale sensor. However, the scale sensor in TENO5-A can only roughly detect the discontinuity locations instead of evaluating the local flow wavenumber as desired. In this work, a new five-point scale sensor, which can estimate the local flow wavenumber accurately, is proposed to further improve the performance of TENO5-A. In combination with a hyperbolic tangent function, the new scale sensor is deployed to the TENO5-A framework for adapting the cut-off parameter $C_T$, i.e., the local nonlinear dissipation, according to the local flow wavenumber. Overall, sufficient numerical dissipation is generated to capture discontinuities, whereas a minimum amount of dissipation is delivered for better resolving the smooth flows. A set of benchmark cases is simulated to demonstrate the performance of the new TENO5-A scheme. ",

Periodic extraction of the DKS into a waveguide produces a pulse train and yields the resulting optical frequency comb's repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a system with a single repetition rate but two different phase velocities by employing dual driving forces. By recasting these phase velocities into frequencies, we demonstrate, experimentally and theoretically, that they can mix and create new phase-velocity light following any four-wave mixing process, including both degenerately pumped and non-degenerately pumped effects. In particular, we show that a multiple-pumped DKS may generate a two-dimensional frequency comb, where cascaded nonlinear mixing occurs in the phase velocity dimension as well as the conventional mode number dimension, and where the repetition rate in each dimension differs by orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "The use of the probabilistic approach to solve inverse problems is becoming more popular in the geophysical community, thanks to its ability to address nonlinear forward problems and to provide uncertainty quantification. However, such strategy is often tailored to specific applications and therefore there is a lack of a common platform for solving a range of different geophysical inverse problems and showing potential and pitfalls. We demonstrate a common framework to solve such inverse problems ranging from, e.g, earthquake source location to potential field data inversion and seismic tomography. Within this approach, we can provide probabilities related to certain properties or structures of the subsurface. Thanks to its ability to address high-dimensional problems, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm has emerged as the state-of-the-art tool for solving geophysical inverse problems within the probabilistic framework. HMC requires the computation of gradients, which can be obtained by adjoint methods, making the solution of tomographic problems ultimately feasible. These results can be obtained with \"HMCLab\", a tool for solving a range of different geophysical inverse problems using sampling methods, focusing in particular on the HMC algorithm. HMCLab consists of a set of samplers and a set of geophysical forward problems. For each problem its misfit function and gradient computation are provided and, in addition, a set of prior models can be combined to inject additional information into the inverse problem. This allows users to experiment with probabilistic inverse problems and also address real-world studies. We show how to solve a selected set of problems within this framework using variants of the HMC algorithm and analyze the results. HMCLab is provided as an open source package written both in Python and Julia, welcoming contributions from the community. ",

From this spectrum, we previously assigned the ${\\nu}_4$ and ${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_4$-${\\nu}_3$ bands around 3060 cm$^{-1}$ using PGOPHER, and the line list was incorporated in the HITRAN database. Here, we treat the two fundamental bands, ${\\nu}_1$ and ${\\nu}_4$, together with the perturbing states, 2${\\nu}_2$+${\\nu}_3$ and ${\\nu}_2$+2${\\nu}_6$$^{\\pm2}$, as a four-level system connected via Coriolis and Fermi interactions. A similar four-level system is assumed to connect the ${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_1$-${\\nu}_3$ and ${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_4$-${\\nu}_3$ hot bands, which appear due to the population of the low-lying ${\\nu}_3$ state at room temperature, with the 2${\\nu}_2$+2${\\nu}_3$ and ${\\nu}_2$+${\\nu}_3$-${\\nu}_6$$^{\\pm2}$ perturbing states. This treatment provides a good global agreement of the simulated spectra with experiment, and hence accurate line lists and band parameters of the four connected vibrational states in each system. Overall, we assign 4665 transitions in the fundamental band system, with an average error of 0.00071 cm$^{-1}$, a factor of two better than earlier work on the ${\\nu}_1$ band using conventional Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The ${\\nu}_1$ band shows hyperfine splitting, resolvable for transitions with J $\\le$ 2 x K. Finally, the spectral intensities of 65 lines of the ${\\nu}_1$ band and 7 lines of the ${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_1$-${\\nu}_3$ band are reported for the first time using the Voigt line shape as a model in multispectral fitting.

Here we predict a novel kind of bound quantum state in the simplest one-dimensional setup of two interacting particles in a box. Paradoxically, two entangled particles become localized at the opposite edges of the box even though their interactions at large distance should seemingly play no role. Such states could be realized in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics platform, where an array of superconducting qubits or cold atoms is coupled to a waveguide. We demonstrate how long-range waveguide-mediated couplings enable interaction-induced quantum states separated by large distances. Similarly to Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model, such bound state of distant photons is immune to short-range interactions and could find applications in robust quantum information processing. ",

This process is described by a charge carrier exchange velocity that depends on the mobility and electric field inside the transport layer. The losses implied by this process are modelled in an equivalent circuit model in the form of a voltage-dependent transport layer resistance. The analysis of the model predicts that the voltage dependence of the measured time constants allows discriminating situations where the transport layer properties dominate the experimental response. Application of this method to experimental impedance spectroscopy data identifies charge extraction velocities between 1-100 cm/s at 1 sun open-circuit conditions for p-i-n PSCs with PTAA as the hole transport layer, that corresponds to transport layer mobilities between 10^-4 - 3 x 10^-3 cm^2V^-1s^-1. The model paves the way for accurate estimation of photocurrent and fill factor losses in PSCs caused by the low mobilities in the transport layers, using small perturbation measurements in the time and frequency domain.
