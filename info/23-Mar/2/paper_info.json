    "title": "Colossal optical anisotropy from atomic-scale modulations",
    "abstract": "In modern optics, materials with large birefringence ({\\Delta}n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g. in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics and quantum optics (e.g. for phase matching and production of entangled photons), micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light-matter coupling, such as Dyakonov-like surface polaritons and hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered \"van der Waals\" materials, with strong intra-layer bonding and weak inter-layer bonding, can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optic axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached, making the anisotropy hard to access. Here, we demonstrate that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure -- Sr9/8TiS3 -- is transparent and positive-uniaxial, with extraordinary index n_e = 4.5 and ordinary index n_o = 2.4 in the mid- to far-infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal-prismatic units that break the infinite chains of face-shared TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr subsequently occupy the TiS6 octahedral blocks to form highly oriented and polarizable electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index n_e and result in record birefringence ({\\Delta}n > 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive-index modulation and low optical losses.

    "abstract": "Lithium (Li) metal anodes are essential for developing next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Numerous concerns on the potential safety hazards of the Li metal have been brought up before its massive application in commercialized battery packs. However, few investigations have been performed to systematically evaluate the reactivity of Li metal anode in full cell level. Here, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are used to quantitatively investigate the Li metal reactivity. Lithiated graphite (Li-Gr) and lithiated silicon (Li-Si) are also studied as the comparison samples. The reactivity of the plated Li when coupled with different electrolyte composition, morphology, and atmosphere is systematically studied. More importantly, the reactivity of Li metal full cell with different cathode materials (NMC622, LFP and LNMO) has been compared. It was found that all cell components, including electrolyte composition, Li morphology, the control of inactive Li accumulation and cathode stability, are essential in controlling the reactivity of the plated Li. After optimizing these conditions, the Li metal full cell shows no significant thermal reaction up to 400C. This work identifies the key parameters in controlling the reactivity of the plated Li and may facilitate lithium metal battery design and manufacturing in the coming future. ",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian physics is responsible for many of the counter-intuitive effects observed in optics research opening up new possibilities in sensing, polarization control and measurement. A hallmark of non-Hermitian matrices is the possibility of non-orthogonal eigenvectors resulting in coupling between modes. The advantages of propagation mode coupling have been little explored in magneto-optical filters and other devices based on birefringence. Magneto-optical filters select for ultra-narrow transmission regions by passing light through an atomic medium in the presence of a magnetic field. Passive filter designs have traditionally been limited by Doppler broadening of thermal vapors. Even for filter designs incorporating a pump laser, transmissions are typically less than 15\\% for sub-Doppler features. Here we exploit our understanding of non-Hermitian physics to induce non-orthogonal propagation modes in a vapor and realize better magneto-optical filters. We construct two new filter designs with ENBWs and maximum transmissions of 181~MHz, 42\\% and 140~MHz, 17\\% which are the highest figure of merit and first sub-100~MHz FWHM passive filters recorded respectively. This work opens up a range of new filter applications including metrological devices for use outside a lab setting and commends filtering as a new candidate for deeper exploration of non-Hermitian physics such as exceptional points of degeneracy.

Each gallery continues with a set of equidistant longitudinal modes with exponentially increasing quality factors.

However, in quantum, the role of gain or loss in a non-hermitian system is totally different, the specific quantum optical effect induced by which has never been studied. Here, we analytically obtained the PT-symmetry and PT-broken regime bounded by two exceptional lines in a bi-photonic structure with both gain and loss simultaneously existing. For the consideration of reality, the steady state condition under the weak gain is identified. We defined the exchange operator to represent the photon exchange between two modes and further to characterize the transition from PT symmetry to broken. Also, in the PT broken bi-waveguide system, multi-photon state can be on-demand engineered through the quantum interference. Quantum PT-Phase diagram with steady state regime is the basis to study the quantum state fabrication, quantum interferences, and logic operations in non-hermitian quantum systems. ",

    "abstract": "Cold atom interferometers have matured to a powerful tool in fundamental physics research, and they are currently on their way from realizations in the laboratory to applications in the real world. The radio frequency (RF) generator is an indispensable component to control lasers and then manipulate atoms. We developed a highly compact RF generator for fast switching and sweeping frequencies/amplitudes of atomic interference pulse sequences. Multi-channel RF signals are generated by using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to control eight direct digital synthesizers (DDSs). We further proposed and demonstrated a method of preloading the parameters of all RF pulse sequences to the DDS registers before the execution of the pulse sequences, which eliminates the data transfer between the FPGA and DDSs to change RF signals and thus sharply shortens the delay of frequency switching when the pulse sequences are running. The characterized performance shows the generated RF signals achieve 119 ns frequency switching delay, and 40 dB harmonic rejection ratio. The generated RF pulse sequences are applied to a cold atom-interferometer gyroscope, and the contrast of atomic interference fringes reaches 38%. This compact multi-channel generator with the fast frequency/amplitude switching or/and sweeping capability has beneficial applications for the real-world atom interferometers. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the development of ultra-low loss silicon nitride integrated photonic circuits have heralded a new generation of integrated lasers capable of reaching fiber laser coherence. However, these devices presently are based on self-injection locking of distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes, increasing both the cost and requiring tuning of laser setpoints for their operation. In contrast, turn-key legacy laser systems use reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOA). While this scheme has been utilized for integrated photonics-based lasers, so far, no cost-effective RSOA-based integrated lasers exist that are low noise and simultaneously feature fast, mode-hop-free and linear frequency tuning as required for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR or for laser locking in frequency metrology. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a RSOA-based, frequency agile integrated laser, that can be tuned with high speed, with high linearity at low power. This is achieved using monolithic integration of piezoelectrical actuators on ultra-low loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits in a Vernier filter-based laser scheme. The laser operates at 1550 nm, features 6 mW output power, 400 Hz intrinsic laser linewidth, and allows ultrafast wavelength switching within 7 ns rise time and 75 nW power consumption. In addition, we demonstrate the suitability for FMCW LiDAR by showing laser frequency tuning over 1.5 GHz at 100 kHz triangular chirp rate with nonlinearity of 0.25% after linearization, and use the source for measuring a target scene 10 m away with a 8.5 cm distance resolution.

    "abstract": "Anapole states are broadly investigated in nanophotonics for their ability to provide field enhancement and transparency. While low extinction has been achieved in dielectric nanoparticles due to the absence of intrinsic losses, in the case of plasmonic nanostructures this is still lacking. Here, we report an easy-to-fabricate planar plasmonic nanostructure found via topology optimization, which exhibits an anapole state with close-to-ideal characteristics in the visible regime including weak absorption, high near-field enhancment, and strong suppression of scattering. The nanonantenna can act as an individual meta-atom because, due to low inter-coupling, it preserves its optical response even when used in highly packed metasurfaces and metamaterials. The low losses are due to the optimized topology which provides concentration of the field outside the structure with minimum penetration inside the metal. Compared to anapole states in dielectric structures, the accessibility of the volume of enhanced field is suitable for sensing applications. Anapole states are typically interpreted as the result of the interference between electric and toroidal dipole moments. Here and based on a novel approach, in the context of secondary multipole analysis, we introduce the concept of anapole state without using the contribution of toroidal dipole moments. The article provides new insight into anapoles in plasmonic nanostructures and ways to achieve them, while remarking the power of topology optimization to unlock designs with novel functionalities.

Measuring deviations from the results of perturbative SFQED at high $\\chi$ can be valuable for testing the existing predictions, as well as for guiding further theoretical developments. Nevertheless such experimental measurements are challenging due to the probabilistic nature of the interaction processes, a strong background produced by low-$\\chi$ interactions and limited capabilities to control and measure the alignment and synchronization in such collision experiments. Here we elaborate a methodology of using approximate Bayesian computations (ABC) for retrieving statistically justified inferences based on the results of many repeated experiments even in case of partially unknown collision parameters that vary from experiment to experiment.

Here, for the first time, we have developed a cross-validated optical thermometry method using a bulk diamond sample containing both NV centers and silicon vacancy (SiV) centers. Particularly, the latter allowing all-optical method has been intrinsically immune to those influencing perturbations for the NV-based quantum thermometry, hence serving as a real-time cross validation system.

In these fields, the ability to generate quantum mechanically-entangled photons is opening avenues to explore the interaction of molecules with quantum light. This work considers an alternative way of correlating photons by including energy superpositions. We study how the multichromatic quantum superposition, or color superposition of photon-pair states, influences the optical properties of organic chromophores. This work uses electronic structure calculations based on time-dependent density functional theory, and a simple modification of the standard entangled two-photon absorption theory. Our calculations show that it is possible to substantially modify the optical absorption cross section of molecules, where constructive and destructive interferences are computed. The quantum interference effects are more pronounced than the constructive ones. These quantum effects, or related ones, could be observed in quantum spectroscopic experiments where qudit photon states are generated. ",
