    "abstract": "Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) are a fundamental building block for many photonic systems. However, their power inefficiency has been setting back operational cost reduction, and the resulting thermal losses constrain miniaturization, and the realization of more complex photonic functions such as large-scale switches and optical phased arrays. In this work, we demonstrate significant gain and efficiency enhancement using an extra degree of freedom of light - the mode space. This is done without changing the SOA's material design, and therefore high versatility and compatibility can be obtained. Light is multiplexed in different guided modes and is reinjected into the same gain section twice without introducing resonance, doubling the interaction length in a broadband manner. Up to 87% higher gain and 300% higher wall-plug efficiency are obtained in a double-pass SOA compared to a conventional single-pass SOA, at the same operating current, in the wavelength range of 1560 - 1580 nm.

    "abstract": "We present a compact, long-term nearly continuous operation of a room-temperature Ca+ optical clock setup towards a transportable clock, achieving an overall systematic uncertainty of 4.8*10^(-18) and an uptime rate of 97.8% over an 8-day period. The active liquid-cooling scheme is adopted, combined with the precise temperature measurement with 13 temperature sensors both inside and outside the vacuum chamber to ensure the accurate evaluation of the thermal environment for the optical clock. The environmental temperature uncertainty is evaluated as 293.31(0.4) K, corresponding to a blackbody radiation (BBR) frequency shift uncertainty of 4.6*10^(-18), which is reduced more than two times compared to our previous work. Through the frequency comparison between the room temperature Ca+ optical clock and a cryogenic Ca+ optical clock, the overall uncertainty of the clock comparison is 7.5*10^(-18), including a statistic uncertainty of 4.9*10^(-18) and a systematic uncertainty of 5.7*10^(-18). This work provides a set of feasible implementations for high-precision transportable ion optical clocks. ",

The observed subdiffusion of optical vortices show excellent agreement with the fractional Brownian motion, a Gaussian process. Paradoxically, the vortex displacements are observed exhibiting a non-Gaussian heavy-tailed distribution. We also tune the extent of subdiffusion and non-Gaussianity of optical vortex by varying the viscoelasticity of light scattering media. This complex motion of optical vortices is reminiscent of particles in viscoelastic environments suggesting a vortex tracking based microrheology approach. The fractional Brownian yet non-Gaussian subdiffusion of optical vortices may not only offer insights into the dynamics of phase singularities, but also contribute to the understanding certain general physics, including vortex diffusion in fluids and the decoupling between Brownian and Gaussian.

    "abstract": "The surface/interface species in perovskite oxides play an essential role in many novel emergent physical phenomena and chemical processes. With low eigen-energy in the terahertz region, such species at buried interfaces remain poorly understood due to the lack of feasible experimental techniques. Here, we show that vibrational resonances and two-dimensional electron gas at the interface can be characterized using surface-specific nonlinear spectroscopy in the terahertz range. This technique uses intra-pulse difference frequency mixing (DFM) process, which is allowed only at surface/interface of a medium with inversion symmetry. Sub-monolayer sensitivity can be achieved using the state-of-the-art detection scheme for the terahertz emission from surface/interface. As a demonstration, Drude-like nonlinear response from the two-dimensional electron gas emerging at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 or Al2O3/ SrTiO3 interface was successfully observed. Meanwhile, the interfacial vibrational spectrum of the ferroelectric soft mode of SrTiO3 at 2.8 THz was also obtained that was polarized by the surface field in the interfacial region. The corresponding surface/interface potential, which is a key parameter for SrTiO3-based interface superconductivity and photocatalysis, can now be determined optically via quantitative analysis on the polarized phonon spectrum. The interfacial species with resonant frequencies in the THz region revealed by our method provide more insights into the understanding of physical properties of complex oxides. ",

One key aspect of nonlinear light-matter interaction was, so far, not studied systematically at free-electron lasers -- its dependence on the photon energy. Using resonant ion spectroscopy, we map out the transient electronic structures occurring during the complex charge-up pathways. Massively hollow atoms featuring up to six simultaneous core holes determine the spectra at specific photon energies and charge states. We also illustrate how the influence of different X-ray pulse parameters that are usually intertwined can be partially disentangled. The extraction of resonance spectra is facilitated by the fact that the ion yields become independent of the peak fluence beyond a saturation point. Our study lays the groundwork for novel spectroscopies of transient atomic species in exotic, multiple-core-hole states that have not been explored previously. ",

Near $n=1$ resonance on the confined lower X-mode branch, amplification is supported by the decrease of phase and group speeds. Confined slow large-amplitude quasi-electrostatic X-modes nonlinearly modulate the plasma to form cavitons until self-trapped inside them at further increasing wavenumber. They undergo wave-wave interaction, enabling escape to free space in the second harmonic band below $n=2$. At sufficiently large parallel wavenumber (oblique propagation), the fundamental resonance $n=1$ is hyperbolic, a possibility so far missed but vital for an effective ECMI in the upward current region. Here, the resonance hyperbola favourably fits the loss cone boundary, the presumably important ECMI upward-current source-electron distribution, to stimulate ECMI growth at available auroral electron energies.

Main material candidates for cryogenic ultra-stable cavities include silicon and sapphire. Although sapphire has many excellent properties at low temperature, the development of sapphire-based cavities is less advanced than that of silicon-based. Using a homemade cryogenic sapphire cavity, we develop an ultra-stable laser source with a frequency instability of $1.9\\times10^{-16}$. This is the best frequency instability level among similar systems using cryogenic sapphire cavities reported so far. Low vibration performance of the cryostat is demonstrated with a two-stage vibration isolation, and the vibration suppression is further improved by different mixing ratio of the gas-liquid helium. With this technique, vibrations at frequencies higher than tens of hertz are greatly suppressed. ",

When the spacing between adjacent array elements is larger than half wavelength, the effect of mutual coupling can generally be neglected in current antenna designs. However, in holographic MIMO communications, the influence of strong mutual coupling on antenna characteristics is inevitable, resulting in distorted radiation patterns and low radiation efficiencies. In this paper, starting from the analytical correlation and efficiency models, we investigate how the mutual coupling affects the capacity of a space-constrained MIMO system from the aspects of degree of freedom (DOF) and antenna efficiency. The involved fundamental concepts of correlation, DOF, efficiency and mutual coupling are crucial for both antenna and wireless-communication engineers when designing emerging MIMO communication systems.

It is shown that the best resonant orbit in terms of the cost of the characteristic velocity is an orbit with a 1:1 ratio of the period to the orbital period of Venus. A procedure for choosing one of possible resonant orbits depending on coordinates of the desired landing point on the surface and the launch date of the mission is described.

Due to the plasmonic properties of TiN nanoparticles, incident light is perfectly absorbed in a broadband range (300-3000 nm) to generate heat within these metamaterials. Under irradiation of an 808 nm near-infrared laser with different intensities, our predicted temperature rises as a function of time agree well with recent experimental data. For a given laser intensity, the temperature rise varies non-monotonically with concentration of TiN nanoparticles because the enhancement of thermal conductivity and absorbed energy as adding plasmonic nanostructures leads to opposite effects on the heating process. When the model is extended to solar heating, photothermal behaviors are qualitatively similar but the temperature increase is less than 13 $K$. Our studies would provide good guidance for future experimental studies on the photo-to-heat conversion of broadband perfect absorbers. ",

For example, these capabilities have been leveraged for state-of-the-art frequency metrology as well as microscopic studies of entangled many-particle states. In this work, we combine these applications to realize spin squeezing - a widely studied operation for producing metrologically useful entanglement - in an optical atomic clock based on a programmable array of interacting optical qubits. In this first demonstration of Rydberg-mediated squeezing with a neutral-atom optical clock, we generate states that have almost 4 dB of metrological gain. Additionally, we perform a synchronous frequency comparison between independent squeezed states and observe a fractional frequency stability of $1.087(1)\\times 10^{-15}$ at one-second averaging time, which is 1.94(1) dB below the standard quantum limit, and reaches a fractional precision at the $10^{-17}$ level during a half-hour measurement. We further leverage the programmable control afforded by optical tweezer arrays to apply local phase shifts in order to explore spin squeezing in measurements that operate beyond the relative coherence time with the optical local oscillator. The realization of this spin-squeezing protocol in a programmable atom-array clock opens the door to a wide range of quantum-information inspired techniques for optimal phase estimation and Heisenberg-limited optical atomic clocks.

Here we study systematically the behavior of absorption around 700 nm and birefringence with increasing nitrogen- and NV-doping, as well as their behavior during NV creation via diamond growth, electron beam irradiation and annealing treatments. Absorption correlates with increased nitrogen-doping yet substitutional nitrogen does not seem to be the direct absorber. Birefringence reduces with increasing nitrogen doping.
