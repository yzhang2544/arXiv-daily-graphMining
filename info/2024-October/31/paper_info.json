In particular, in silicon we observe an increase in both the Kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear figure of merit of up to 20 times. These results show the strong capability of GO films for improving the nonlinear optical performance of integrated photonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), can yield high-value parts with unique geometries and features, substantially reducing costs and enhancing performance. However, the material properties from L-PBF processes are highly sensitive to the laser processing conditions and the resulting dynamic temperature fields around the melt pool. In this study, we develop a methodology to measure thermal gradients, cooling rates, and solidification velocities during solidification of refractory alloy C103 using in situ high-speed infrared (IR) imaging with a high frame rate of approximately 15,000 frames per second (fps). Radiation intensity maps are converted to temperature maps by integrating thermal radiation over the wavelength range of the camera detector while also considering signal attenuation caused by optical parts. Using a simple method that assigns the liquidus temperature to the melt pool boundary identified ex situ, a scaling relationship between temperature and the IR signal was obtained. The spatial temperature gradients (dT/dx), heating/cooling rates (dT/dt), and solidification velocities (R) are resolved with sufficient temporal resolution under various laser processing conditions, and the resulting microstructures are analyzed, revealing epitaxial growth and nucleated grain growth. Thermal data shows that a decreasing temperature gradient and increasing solidification velocity from the edge to the center of the melt pool can induce a transition from epitaxial to equiaxed grain morphology, consistent with the previously reported columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) trend. The methodology presented can reduce the uncertainty and variability in AM and guide microstructure control during AM of metallic alloys.         ",

The training of the feed-forward Neural Network (NN) enables the prediction of the device's properties solely from spectral data, here recorded by visible-/nearinfrared-light compact micro-spectrometers for both a diode pump laser and optically-pumped gain membrane of a semiconductor disk laser. Fiber spectrometers are used for the acquisition of large quantities of labelled intensity data, which can afterwards be used for the prediction process. Such pretrained deep NNs enable a fast, reliable and easy way to infer the temperature of a laser system such as our Membrane External Cavity Laser, at a later monitoring stage without the need of additional optical diagnostics or read-out temperature sensors. With the miniature mobile spectrometer and the remote detection ability, the temperature inference capability can be adapted for various laser diodes using transfer learning methods with pretrained models. Here, mean-square-error values for the temperature inference corresponding to sub-percent accuracy of our sensor scheme are reached, while computational cost can be saved by reducing the network depth at the here displayed cost of accuracy, as appropriate for different application scenarios.

Its confinement potential, which is described by an asymmetric harmonic-gaussian function, consists of two wells separated by a potential barrier, and the asymmetry of the potential in respect to the center of the barrier is parameterized by $x_0$. In this work we employ Shannon informational entropy as a tool to investigate changes in the electronic confinement resulting from the modifications in the degree of asymmetry $x_0$. In particular, we notice that Shannon entropy turns out to be very sensitive to the change from the symmetric to the antisymmetric regime. Moreover, we show that Shannon entropy as a function of $x_0$ for an electronic excited state displays an irregular behavior whenever the state energy is in the vicinity of a local extreme (a maximum or a minimum); connected with this we observe an oscillatory behavior of the energy of the excited states as a function of $x_0$.

The lengths of another pair of bonds are modulated periodically with frequencies of some 10 MHz by means of diodes, thus emulating a magnetic radiofrequency field.

Accordingly, an optical redefinition of the second has been widely discussed, prompting a need for the consistency of optical clocks to be verified worldwide. While satellite frequency links are sufficient to compare microwave clocks, a suitable method for comparing high-performance optical clocks over intercontinental distances is missing. Furthermore, remote comparisons over frequency links face fractional uncertainties of a few $10^{-18}$ due to imprecise knowledge of each clock's relativistic redshift, which stems from uncertainty in the geopotential determined at each distant location. Here, we report a landmark campaign towards the era of optical clocks, where, for the first time, state-of-the-art transportable optical clocks from Japan and Europe are brought together to demonstrate international comparisons that require neither a high-performance frequency link nor information on the geopotential difference between remote sites. Conversely, the reproducibility of the clocks after being transported between countries was sufficient to determine geopotential height offsets at the level of 4 cm. Our campaign paves the way for redefining the SI second and has a significant impact on various applications, including tests of general relativity, geodetic sensing for geosciences, precise navigation, and future timing networks.

Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.

The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity.

    "abstract": "           Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\\alpha^\\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\\beta=\\alpha/2$.

To address these challenges, we explore the method known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) as an efficient alternative for fast and reliable atom transport control. We present a series of proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that STA-based optical tweezer trajectories can achieve both rapid and reliable single-atom transport. These experiments include moving atoms between two locations, adjusting speeds en route, and navigating curved trajectories. Our results indicate that atoms can be transported with a constant acceleration on average over distances that is only limited by trap lifetime, while effectively suppressing vibrational heating.

    "abstract": "           Information transfer through electromagnetic waves is an important problem that touches a variety of technologically relevant applications, including computing and telecommunications. Prior attempts to establish limits on optical information transfer have treated waves propagating through known photonic structures (including vacuum). In this article, we address fundamental questions concerning optimal information transfer in photonic devices. Combining information theory, wave scattering, and optimization theory, we formulate bounds on the maximum Shannon capacity that may be achieved by structuring senders, receivers, and their environment. Allowing for arbitrary structuring leads to a non-convex problem that is significantly more difficult than its fixed structure counterpart, which is convex and satisfies a known \"water-filling\" solution. We derive a geometry-agnostic convex relaxation of the problem that elucidates fundamental physics and scaling behavior of Shannon capacity with respect to device parameters and the importance of structuring for enhancing capacity. We also show that in regimes where communication is dominated by power insertion requirements, bounding Shannon capacity maps to a biconvex optimization problem in the basis of singular vectors of the Green's function. This problem admits analytical solutions that give physically intuitive interpretations of channel and power allocation and reveals how Shannon capacity varies with signal-to-noise ratio. Proof of concept numerical examples show that bounds are within an order of magnitude of achievable device performance and successfully predict the scaling of performance with channel noise. The presented methodologies have implications for the optimization of antennas, integrated photonic devices, metasurface kernels, MIMO space-division multiplexers, and waveguides to maximize communication efficiency and bit-rates.

The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave provides stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, achieving phase-contrast TEM. Building on proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations, this paper explores design improvements tailored to biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP increases information transfer at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which dramatically suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.         ",

    "abstract": "           With the advent and development of real-world quantum technology applications, a practically-focused quantum education including student quantum experiments are gaining increasing importance in physics curricula. In this paper, using the DeFT framework, we present an analysis of the representations in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment, in order to assess their potential for promoting conceptual learning. We also discuss learner visual attention with respect to the provided multiple representations based on the eye gaze data we have obtained from a pilot study where N=38 students carried out the tasks in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment.

    "title": "Exact solutions for radiative transfer with partial frequency redistribution",
    "abstract": "           The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and with Hilbert transforms, as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions providing the radiation field for an arbitrary primary source and for the Green function. An explicit expression is given for the radiation field emerging from a semi-infinite medium.         ",
