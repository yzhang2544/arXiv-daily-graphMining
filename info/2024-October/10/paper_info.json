    "abstract": "           We report on a method for coherent control of the $\\gamma$-photons enabling the shaping of $\\gamma$-ray intensity in various waveforms. The creation of different intensity waveforms is achieved by adjusting the motion profile of the resonant absorber and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this methodology is the utilisation of a low fundamental frequency of the vibrations, which makes experiments feasible and broadens the possibilities of $\\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are proved experimentally by generating single and double $\\gamma$-pulses, and inducing short-term absorption using different absorber motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with the fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents advancement in the manipulation of $\\gamma$-rays and x-rays, paving the way for the performance of new types of $\\gamma$-ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of new tools such as adjustable table-top $\\gamma$-pulse sources or $\\gamma$-ray or x-ray delays and gates.

    "abstract": "           The sound modes of a flowing superfluid is described by the massless Klein-Gordon equation in an effective background metric. This effective background metric can be designed to mimick a black hole using the acoustic horizon. In this work, we study the AdS/CFT dual of the sound modes in the presence of an acoustic horizon in the bulk. Focusing on fluids with a purely radial flow, we derive the metric tensor for the effective acoustic spacetime and deduce a necessary condition for an acoustic black hole geometry to exist within the fluid. Using specific examples of superfluid velocity profiles, we obtained the source, operator expectation value, Green's function, and spectral density of the dual field theory by solving for the asymptotic behavior of the sound modes near the AdS boundary. In all our examples, the sound modes remain gapless but the excitations are described by branch cuts, instead of poles, which is typical of strongly coupled systems. Furthermore, we calculate the effective Hawking temperature of the dual field theory associated with the bulk acoustic horizon. Lastly, we investigate the near horizon properties and derive the superfluid velocity profile that can give rise to an infrared emergent quantum criticality.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic integrated switches that are both space and wavelength selective are a highly promising technology for data-intensive applications as they benefit from multi-dimensional manipulation of optical signals. However, scaling these switches normally poses stringent challenges such as increased fabrication complexity and control difficulties, due to the growing number of switching elements. In this work, we propose a novel dilated crosspoint topology, which efficiently handles both space and wavelength selective switching, while reducing the required switching element count by an order of magnitude compared to reported designs. To the best of our knowledge, our design requires the fewest switching elements for an equivalent routing paths number and it fully cancels the first-order in-band crosstalk. We demonstrate such an ultra-compact space-and-wavelength-selective switch (SWSS) at a scale of 4{\\times}4{\\times}4{\\lambda} on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Experimental results reveal that the switch achieves an insertion loss ranging from 2.3 dB to 8.6 dB and crosstalk levels in between -35.3 dB and -59.7 dB. The add-drop microring-resonators (MRRs) are equipped with micro-heaters, exhibiting a rise and fall time of 46 {\\mu}s and 0.33 {\\mu}s, respectively. These performance characteristics highlight the switch's ultra-low element count and crosstalk with low insertion loss, making it a promising candidate for advanced data center applications.

    "abstract": "           Microperforated panels (MPPs) display excellent capacity in noise control applications owing to their high strength, simple design, and efficacy in low-frequency sound absorption. Traditionally, the development of MPPs has relied on a trial-and-error design approach. Although simple optimization-based methods have recently begun to be employed, these designs often overlook practical considerations, such as the increased costs associated with adding more MPP layers, which presents a gap to achieve the practical feasibility of MPP deployment. To address this, the study aims to develop an inverse multi-objective optimization-empowered framework for MPP design to enhance low-frequency noise mitigation while minimizing fabrication costs. Specifically, a finite element (FE) model is established to conduct the acoustic analysis of MPPs, followed by thorough experimental validation. A novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) is then developed to cope with mixed-type design variables with interrelations inherent to the MPP architecture. Using the high-fidelity FE model as a cornerstone, the MOPSO guides the inverse optimization analysis to yield multiple non-dominant solutions. These solutions not only avoid the trap of local optima, but also allow for continuous screening to ensure the engineering viability based on empirical judgment. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The MPPs designed in this study show great potential for mitigating indoor noise in buildings, addressing noise issues arising from rapid urbanization and transportation development. Furthermore, the novel optimization strategy proposed in this study holds wide applicability for other sound absorption materials.         ",

    "abstract": "           State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.

    "abstract": "           Standing acoustic waves have been known to generate Eulerian time-mean 'streaming' flows at least since the seminal investigation of Lord Rayleigh in the 1880s. Nevertheless, a recent body of numerical and experimental evidence has shown that inhomogeneities in the ambient density distribution lead to much faster flows than arise in classical Rayleigh streaming. The emergence of these unusually strong flows creates new opportunities to enhance heat transfer in systems in which convective cooling cannot otherwise be easily achieved. To assess this possibility, a theoretical study of acoustic streaming in an ideal gas confined in a rectangular channel with top and bottom walls maintained at fixed but differing temperatures is performed. A two time scale system of equations is utilized to efficiently capture the coupling between the fast acoustic waves and the slowly evolving streaming flow, enabling strongly nonlinear regimes to be accessed. A large suite of numerical simulations is carried out to probe the streaming dynamics, to highlight the critical role played by baroclinically generated wave vorticity and to quantify the additional heat flux induced by the standing acoustic wave. Proper treatment of the two-way coupling between the waves and mean flow is found to be essential for convergence to a self-consistent steady state, and the variation of the resulting acoustically enhanced steady-state heat flux with both the amplitude of the acoustic wave and the O(1) aspect ratio of the channel is documented. For certain parameters, heat fluxes almost two orders of magnitude larger than those realizable by conduction alone can be attained.         ",

Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth.

It is anticipated that this type of optical structure can be exploited for encoding information in optical communication, even under perturbations such as turbulent air, optical fibers, and even general random media. In this study, we numerically demonstrate that the skyrmion numbers of optical skyrmion fields exhibit a certain degree of robustness to atmospheric turbulence, even though their intensity, phase and polarization patterns are distorted. Intriguingly, it is also observed that a larger difference between the absolute values of two azimuthal indices of the vectorial structured light field can lead to a superior level of resilience. These properties not only enhance the versatility of skyrmion fields and their numbers, but also open up new possibilities for their use in various applications across noisy channels.         ",

We present a hafnium (Hf)-based TES bolometer for CMB experiments. We employ a novel heated sputter deposition of the Hf films enabling us to finely tune the critical temperature (Tc) between 140 mK - 210 mK. We found elevated deposition temperatures result in films with lower stress, larger crystal sizes, and a smaller relative abundance of the m-plane to c-plane $\\alpha$ phase, all contributing to the empirical linear dependence of critical temperature on deposition temperature. Crucially, the heated sputter deposition simultaneously ensures that the critical temperature does not drift despite exposure to heat throughout ongoing fab processes (sometimes reaching 350C) as long as the initial deposition temperature is not exceeded. Tcs lower than 170 mK require deposition temperature greater than 400C, far in excess of typical temperatures the wafer may experience. This ample thermal budget allows us to relax the stringent thermal management that conventional aluminum manganese (AlMn) TES bolometers require, for which temperatures as low as 200C - 250C are used to anneal the AlMn in an effort to adjust the Tc. Hf additionally exhibits an intrinsic steep superconducting transition (we measure $\\alpha >$ 200) and a corresponding high loop gain (exceeding $\\mathcal{L}>10$ deep in the transition).

The design of PCWs traditionally relies on complex numerical methods, including finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and plane-wave expansion (PWE) methods, which are often inefficient when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces, particularly for subwavelength structures. To overcome these challenges, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based inverse design method is introduced to optimize the structural parameters of PCWs. By simulating band structures under varying line defect widths and air hole radii using MIT Photonic Bands (MPB), a large dataset was generated, mapping structural parameters to corresponding band characteristics. Backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) and CNN models were trained on this dataset to predict key PCW structural parameters. The CNN model demonstrated superior performance in predicting complex geometries, maintaining high accuracy even when extrapolating beyond the training dataset, with precision up to four decimal places. In contrast, the BPNN model exhibited faster training times and higher computational efficiency on smaller datasets, though it performed less effectively on larger datasets. Cross-validation using MPB confirmed the generalization capability and reliability of both models.

In this work, we analyze nano-gapped Au nanowires (NWs) or Au-NWs dimers for designing efficient nanoantennas, reporting an exhaustive study about dimer length and laser polarization orientation effects on their SERS-based molecular sensing performance. Arrays of nanoantennas with gaps about 22 (+/-)4 [nm], nominal square cross-sections of 60 [nm] x 60 [nm], and different lengths from 300 [nm] up to 1200 [nm] were fabricated by Au evaporation and subsequent e-beam lithography. SERS performance was studied by confocal Raman microscopy using a linearly-polarized 633 [nm] laser. A critical impact of the polarization alignment on the spectral resolution of the studied Raman marker imprint was observed. Results show that the Raman signal is maximized by aligning the polarization orientation with the nanowire long axis, it is reduced by increasing the relative angle, and it is abruptly minimized when both are perpendicular. These observations were consistent with numerical simulations carried out by the FDTD method, which predict a similar dependence between the orientation of linearly-polarized light and electric-near field amplification in the nano-gap zone. Our results provide an interesting paradigm and relevant insights in determining the role of laser polarization on the Raman signal enhancement in nano-gapped Au nanowires, showing the key role of this measurement condition on the SERS-based molecular sensing efficiency of this kind of nanostructure.

    "abstract": "           Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650\u00b0C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in supercontinuum light generation have been remarkable, particularly in the context of highly nonlinear photonic integrated waveguides. In this study, we thoroughly investigate supercontinuum (SC) generation in high-index doped silica glass integrated waveguides, exploring various femtosecond pumping wavelengths and input polarization states. We demonstrate broadband SC generation spanning from 700 nm to 2400 nm when pumping within the anomalous dispersion regime at 1200 nm, 1300 nm, and 1550 nm. In contrast, pumping within the normal dispersion regime at 1000 nm results in narrower SC spectra, primarily due to coherent nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation and optical wave breaking. Additionally, we examine the impact of TE/TM polarization modes on SC generation, shedding light on the polarization-dependent characteristics of the broadening process. Moreover, Raman scattering measurements reveal the emergence of two new peaks at 48.8 THz and 75.1 THz in the Raman gain curve. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations based on a generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation that incorporates the new Raman gain contribution. Finally, relative intensity noise measurements conducted using the dispersive Fourier transform technique indicate excellent stability of the generated SC spectra.         ",

Lett. 117, 064101 (2016)]), following a suggestion by Joyner et al. [Europhys. Lett. 107, 50004(2014))]. The network consisted of two identical sub-units coupled by a pair of bonds with a length difference corresponding to a phase difference of $\\pi$ for the waves traveling through the bonds. In such a symmetry each eigenvalue appears as a two-fold degenerate Kramers doublet. Distorting the symmetry the degeneracy is lifted which may be interpreted in terms of the Zeeman splitting of a spin 1/2 in an external magnetic field. In the present work, a microwave analog of a spin resonance is realized. To this end, two magnetic fields have to be emulated, a static and a radio-frequency one. The static one is realized by detuning the length difference from the $\\pi$ condition by means of phase shifters, the radio-frequency field by modulating the length difference of another pair of bonds by means of diodes with frequencies up to 125 MHz. Features well-known from magnetic resonance such as the transition from the laboratory to the rotating frame, and Lorentzian shaped resonance curves can thus be realized.         ",

Pump-probe methods like time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) avoid these assumptions but are limited to h_c values larger than 30 kW/(m^2-K) due to modulation frequency constraints. This study introduces an optical-based Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, expanding the frequency range from 10 MHz to 1 Hz, enabling measurements of h_c values above 100 W/(m^2-K) with uncertainties under 10%. The efficacy of the SPS method is demonstrated through measurements of local h_c in an impingement heat transfer process with a single round gas jet. The local Nusselt number distribution is compared with existing literature correlations, offering insights into convective heat transfer phenomena. This study presents a novel tool for measuring local intrinsic convective heat transfer coefficients, enhancing the understanding of local convective heat transfer.         ",

However, these gates have only been realized within single nodes or between nodes separated by a few tens of meters, limiting the ability to harness computing resources in large-scale quantum networks. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal photonic quantum gates between two nodes spatially separated by 7.0 km using stationary qubits based on multiplexed quantum memories, flying qubits at telecom wavelengths, and active feedforward control based on field-deployed fibers. Furthermore, we illustrate quantum parallelism by implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum phase estimation algorithm between the two remote nodes.

    "abstract": "           A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.         ",

The response amplitude at the low-frequency is explored to characterize the vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance. By this effort, we realize that for smaller values of the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component, vibrational resonance and multi-resonance occur in the neuronal model. For large values of the high-frequency excitation amplitude, vibrational resonance appears with one peak. We observe a decrease in the response when the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component increases. Also, we analyze how the state-dependent time-delay position and velocity components can give birth to delay-induced resonance for separate and together. The main results of this work are that the state-dependent time-delay velocity component can play a major role in both phenomena.

Photons are the clear choice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and interact with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the quantum illumination framework, which requires a quantum memory to store a single photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a target and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations are limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces various roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and noise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances. We propose a novel quantum sensing framework that addresses these challenges using quantum frequency combs with path identity for remote sensing of signatures (``qCOMBPASS\"). The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum resources, namely quantum induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency combs, and two-mode squeezed light, allows for quantum remote sensing without requiring a quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar based on entangled frequency comb pairs that uses path identity to detect/range/sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb in the pair that never flew to target, but that contains target information ``teleported\" by quantum-induced coherence from the other comb in the pair that did fly to target but is not detected.

    "abstract": "           Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of radio frequency (RF) electric fields is central to a variety of important applications, including radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches, and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) systems, especially trapped ions, have been used with several quantum sensing techniques to achieve electric field sensing with state-of-the-art sensitivity and nanometer spatial resolution. However, these systems are limited to a narrow frequency range centered around either the motional frequency of the trapped ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion; often these techniques are not sensitive to the RF phase. Here, we propose and demonstrate a procedure that unlocks the extreme sensitivity of a QHO to allow high precision wideband detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of an unknown electric field. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion, cooled near its motional ground state to realize state of the art sensitivities to frequency, phase, and amplitude, and show the technique works over a frequency range that is >800x larger than previous techniques. Further, this technique is shown to be compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing performance 3.4(20) dB below the standard quantum limit and the potential for several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity with moderate upgrades. In addition to providing an attractive platform for quantum sensing of small fields, this technique allows in situ calibration of qubit control lines in QHO systems, as well as transduction of external, non-resonant drives into oscillator excitation. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other QHO systems, such as a superconducting qubit-resonator system.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonics offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing by enabling low-latency, high-speed, and energy-efficient computations. However, conventional photonic tensor cores face significant challenges in constructing large-scale photonic neuromorphic networks. Here, we propose a fully integrated photonic tensor core, consisting of only two thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a III-V laser, and a charge-integration photoreceiver. Despite its simple architecture, it is capable of implementing an entire layer of a neural network with a computational speed of 120 GOPS, while also allowing flexible adjustment of the number of inputs (fan-in) and outputs (fan-out). Our tensor core supports rapid in-situ training with a weight update speed of 60 GHz. Furthermore, it successfully classifies (supervised learning) and clusters (unsupervised learning) 112 * 112-pixel images through in-situ training. To enable in-situ training for clustering AI tasks, we offer a solution for performing multiplications between two negative numbers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.         ",

We observe a regular shadow in the sense it can be seen by the naked eye, it follows the contours of the surface it falls on, and it follows the position and shape of the object (the laser beam). Specifically, we use a nonlinear optical process involving four atomic levels of ruby. We are able to control the intensity of a transmitted laser beam by applying another perpendicular laser beam. We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the object laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately of approximately 22 percent, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day. We provide a theoretical model that predicts the contrast of the shadow. This work opens new possibilities for fabrication, imaging, and illumination.         ",

    "abstract": "           Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and foreseeable quantum hardware introduce noise into computations, requiring algorithms that make judicious use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Under these restrictions, variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. A classical device performs nonlinear computations, and a quantum one uses a variational solver for the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. Multigrid preconditioning of the Poisson problem helps avoid local minima and reduces resource requirements for the quantum device. A quantum state readout technique called HTree is used for the first time on a physical problem. Htree is appropriate for real-valued problems and achieves linear complexity in the qubit count, making the Navier-Stokes solve further tractable on current quantum devices. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.         ",

We record the spectra of weak CO$_2$ barrier discharge emission in UV-VIS-NIR range. The CO spectral bands of 3rd positive, Angstrom and Asundi systems are identified in the spectra, together with the CO+2 bands of the UV-doublet and the Fox-Duffendack-Baker systems. The effect of CO$_2$ flow rate variations on the relative intensities of the CO and CO$_2$ optical emissions is also investigated. We analyze the optical emission of selected vibrational spectral bands and attempt to determine the E/N using intensity ratio method with kinetic data available in the literature. The method, using intensities from different spectral bands, is tested on sinusoidal driven atmospheric pressure Townsend (APTD) and single-filament barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure. For APTD at different flows and known CO conversion factors, an attempt is made to use the ratio of selected CO to CO$_2$ band intensities. The technique of time-correlated single photon counting is used to obtain necessary sub-nanosecond temporal resolution and, importantly, high signal sensitivity for the single-filament experiment and its utilization gives a promising result, E/N of 330 Td in barrier discharge streamer. Nevertheless, the uncertainties coming from different kinetic data and the low sensitivity of some rate coefficient ratios complicate an easy utilisation of the method. Future steps are therefore proposed, including uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the simplified model and necessary CO+2 and CO synthetic spectra fitting.         ",

Proof-of-principle demonstrations of such photon collection from trapped ions have been performed using high-numerical-aperture lenses or cavities and single-mode fibers, but integrated photonic elements in ion-trap structures offer advantages in scalability and manufacturabilty over traditional optics. In this paper we analyze structures monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting ion-emitted photons, coupling them into waveguides, and manipulating them via interference. We calculate geometric limitations on collection efficiency for this scheme, simulate a single-layer grating that shows performance comparable to demonstrated free-space optics, and discuss practical fabrication and fidelity considerations.

In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky (EPR) incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. Closing these gaps via a strong \"counterfactual\" reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Conversely, however, it is noted that whereas the EPR argument requires a weaker \"measurement choice\" assumption than Bell's demonstration, it nevertheless leads to a similar incompatibility with quantum predictions rather than to quantum incompleteness.

However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a >10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.         ",

    "abstract": "           Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.         ",

    "title": "Multi-task Photonic Reservoir Computing: Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Parallel Computing with a Silicon Microring Resonator",
    "abstract": "           Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...

    "title": "Efficient Strategies for Reducing Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization",
    "abstract": "           Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization via projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the algorithm often requires solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) involving erroneous matrix pairs, which can significantly distort the solution. Since EFTQC assumes limited-scale error correction, finite sampling error becomes a dominant source of error in these matrices. This work focuses on quantifying sampling errors during the measurement of matrix element in the projected Hamiltonian examining two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: the linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. To reduce sampling error within a fixed budget of quantum circuit repetitions, we propose two measurement strategies: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique eliminates redundant Hamiltonian components that annihilate either the bra or ket states, while coefficient splitting optimizes the measurement of common terms across different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, reducing sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.         ",
