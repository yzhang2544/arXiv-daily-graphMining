    "title": "Scalable construction of hybrid quantum photonic cavities",
    "abstract": "           Nanophotonic resonators are central to numerous applications, from efficient spin-photon interfaces to laser oscillators and precision sensing. A leading approach consists of photonic crystal (PhC) cavities, which have been realized in a wide range of dielectric materials. However, translating proof-of-concept devices into a functional system entails a number of additional challenges, inspiring new approaches that combine: resonators with wavelength-scale confinement and high quality factors; scalable integration with integrated circuits and photonic circuits; electrical or mechanical cavity tuning; and, in many cases, a need for heterogeneous integration with functional materials such as III-V semiconductors or diamond color centers for spin-photon interfaces. Here we introduce a concept that generates a finely tunable PhC cavity at a select wavelength between two heterogeneous optical materials whose properties satisfy the above requirements. The cavity is formed by stamping a hard-to-process material with simple waveguide geometries on top of an easy-to-process material consisting of dielectric grating mirrors and active tuning capability. We simulate our concept for the particularly challenging design problem of multiplexed quantum repeaters based on arrays of cavity-coupled diamond color centers, achieving theoretically calculated unloaded quality factors of $10^6$, mode volumes as small as $1.2(\\lambda/n_{eff})^3$, and maintaining >60 percent total on-chip collection efficiency of fluorescent photons. We further introduce a method of low-power piezoelectric tuning of these hybrid diamond cavities, simulating optical resonance shifts up to ~760 GHz and color center fluorescence tuning of 5 GHz independent of cavity tuning. These results will motivate integrated photonic cavities toward larger scale systems-compatible designs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence, fueled by scientific data, are revolutionizing the discovery of new materials. Despite the wealth of existing scientific literature, the availability of both structured experimental data and chemical domain knowledge that can be easily integrated into data-driven workflows is limited. The motivation to integrate this information, as well as additional context from first-principle calculations and physics-informed deep learning surrogate models, is to enable efficient exploration of the relevant chemical space and to predict structure-property relationships of new materials a priori. Ultimately, such a framework could replicate the expertise of human subject-matter experts. In this work, we present dZiner, a chemist AI agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), that discovers new compounds with desired properties via inverse design (property-to-structure). In specific, the agent leverages domain-specific insights from foundational scientific literature to propose new materials with enhanced chemical properties, iteratively evaluating them using relevant surrogate models in a rational design process, while accounting for design constraints. The model supports both closed-loop and human-in-the-loop feedback cycles, enabling human-AI collaboration in molecular design with real-time property inference, and uncertainty and chemical feasibility assessment. We demonstrate the flexibility of this agent by applying it to various materials target properties, including surfactants, ligand and drug candidates, and metal-organic frameworks. Our approach holds promise to both accelerate the discovery of new materials and enable the targeted design of materials with desired functionalities.

    "abstract": "           We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.

Based on the Cartesian multipole expansion theory, we establish a framework for optical force/torque exerted on an arbitrary sized bi-isotropic (chiral) spherical particle immersed in generic monochromatic optical fields. Rigorous expressions are thus derived which explicitly bridges such mechanical effects of light with particle-property-dependent coefficients and \"force/torque source\" quantities that characterize the incident light structures. Such quantities, totalled only 12, are quadratic in terms of electric and magnetic field vectors, among which are linear and angular momenta, gradient of energy density, spin density, and helicity. They are further organized into four categories based on their parity (P) and duality (D) symmetries and shown to couple with a particle with different P and D symmetries to induce optical force/torque. This classification specifies the symmetry-breaking criteria required to induce optical force/torque, offering a promising roadmap for engineering the optical manipulation.         ",

Interestingly, with an applied magnetic field of 2~G, optical pumping is found to be considerably more efficient for a laser beam with right-circular polarization compared to left-circular polarization. Calculations show that the higher efficiency is due to a constructive versus destructive interference and is dependent on the orientation of the BaF molecule relative to the magnetic field direction. The effect leads to orientation-dependent optical pumping within the matrix. As optical pumping is the first step used in our planned electron electric-dipole moment (eEDM) measurement, we intend to exploit this property to obtain the selection of molecular orientations that is required for an eEDM measurement.

To account for the process of multi-component adsorption, the SEAQT framework incorporates the particle number operator for each absorbed species directly into its equation of motion. The theoretical models developed are validated via some initial comparisons with experimental data found in the literature, demonstrating good agreement. The findings reveal that this framework can be an effective tool for describing the adsorption process out of equilibrium. It is able to do so without $a \\; priori$ knowledge of the specific adsorption mechanism(s) involved. It also aligns well with the anticipated predictions of equilibrium models. In addition, within this framework, all intensive thermodynamic properties are characterized by out-of-equilibrium fluctuations, highlighting the significance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in predicting measurable physical quantities.

It is the so called Langdon effect. It has important consequences on plasma properties. It reduces laser absorption, it modifies atomic physics due to its influence on the free electron population, it alters conduction and any other quantities that depends upon electron velocity distribution (EVD). Here, the Langdon effect has been studied with CMDS using the code LAMMPS where, contrary to Fokker-Plank simulations, widely used in the past, plasma many-body behavior at the microscopic level is taken into account self-consistently. For the first time with CMDS, we have observed the deformation of the instantaneous EVD in Langdon's condition. Anisotropy of these non-Maxwellian effects have been demonstrated at moderate and high intensities. CMDS results (related to the shape of the EVD and to the laser absorption reduction) do not match with previous Fokker-Planck simulations results as well as might have been expected. This should probably stimulate new developments to understand the complex many-body interaction of electrons and ions in a laser irradiated plasma in the future.         ",

Pumping the cw OPO at 532~nm (1550~nm) for degenerate operation in the normal (anomalous) dispersion regime at 1064~nm (3100~nm), and using the coupled-wave equations to simulate the OPO in the presence of intracavity dispersion compensation, we demonstrate that this device offers a new alternative for $\\chi^{(2)}$-based frequency comb generation. We also show that in the time domain the output of such a device corresponds to femtosecond quadratic solitons in both dispersion regimes.

    "abstract": "           The widely established techniques for the generation of ultrashort optical pulses rely on passive mode-locking of lasers, with the output pulse duration and emission spectrum determined by the intrinsic lifetime of laser transition in the gain medium. Due to the instantaneous nature of nonlinear gain, optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) are capable of generating optical radiation in all time scales from continuous-wave (cw) to ultrashort femtosecond regime, if driven by laser pump sources in the corresponding time domain. In the ultrashort time scale, operation of OPOs conventionally relies on mode-locked pump lasers, with the concomitant disadvantages of large footprint and high cost. At the same time, the lack of gain storage mandates the use of synchronous pumping, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we present the concept of phase-modulated OPO driven by cw pump laser. The approach overcomes the traditional drawbacks of ultrafast OPOs, enabling femtosecond pulse generation without the need for synchronous pumping, resulting in a simplified, compact and cost-effective architecture using cw input pump lasers. We derive a mean-field equation for a degenerate $\\chi^{(2)}$ OPO driven by a cw laser with intracavity electro-optic modulator (EOM), and also including dispersion compensation. The new equation predicts the formation of stable femtosecond pulses ($<$200~fs), in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes, with a controllable repetition rate determined by the frequency of the EOM. The remarkable functionality of the proposed scheme paves the way for the development of a new class of widely tunable coherent femtosecond light sources in both bulk and integrated format based on $\\chi^{(2)}$ OPOs using cw pump lasers.

We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.

Here, the previously reported silicon-hafnium oxynitride-tetracene structure is studied and a combination of magnetic-field-dependent silicon photoluminescence measurements and density functional theory calculations is used to probe the influence of the interlayer composition on the triplet transfer process across the hafnium oxynitride interlayer. It is found that hafnium oxide interlayers do not show triplet exciton sensitization of silicon, and that nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band-edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process. Some defects introduce additional deleterious mid-gap states, which may explain observed silicon photoluminescence quenching.

Secondly, we demonstrate how to use the NISE in conjunction with (highly) structured spectral densities by utilizing a noise generating algorithm for arbitrary structured noise. This algorithm also serves as a tool for establishing best practices in determining spectral densities from excited state calculations along molecular dynamics or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics trajectories. Finally, we assess the ability of the NISE approach to calculate absorption spectra and demonstrate the utility of the proposed modifications by determining population dynamics.         ",

    "title": "Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices",
    "abstract": "           Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. In this work, an optical absorption-based model is proposed to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. The instantaneous optical absorption is calculated from the polarization current density associated with the dispersion model. Then, the optical absorption is used to calculate the generation rate. Numerical examples show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based method in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The proposed method is further validated against experimental results by modeling a photoconductive device. In the multiphysics simulation, the Poynting vector-based method overestimates the carrier generation rate and even generates divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong, while the proposed method produces results that match with experimental measurements well.

    "abstract": "           Exceptional points (EPs) -- singularities in the parameter space of non-Hermitian systems where two nearby eigenmodes coalesce -- feature unique properties with applications such as sensitivity enhancement and chiral emission. Existing realizations of EP lasers operate with static populations in the gain medium. By analyzing the full-wave Maxwell--Bloch equations, here we show that in a laser operating sufficiently close to an EP, the nonlinear gain will spontaneously induce a multi-spectral multi-modal instability above a pump threshold, which initiates an oscillating population inversion and generates a frequency comb. The efficiency of comb generation is enhanced by both the spectral degeneracy and the spatial coalescence of modes near an EP. Such an ``EP comb'' has a widely tunable repetition rate, self-starts without external modulators or a continuous-wave pump, and can be realized with an ultra-compact footprint. We develop an exact solution of the Maxwell--Bloch equations with an oscillating inversion, describing all spatiotemporal properties of the EP comb as a limit cycle. We numerically illustrate this phenomenon in a 5-\\textmu m-long gain-loss coupled AlGaAs cavity and adjust the EP comb repetition rate from 20 to 27~GHz. This work provides a rigorous spatiotemporal description of the rich laser behaviors that arise from the interplay between the non-Hermiticity, nonlinearity, and dynamics of a gain medium.         ",

Indeed, accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources is an essential challenge given the limited qubit capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards chemically accurate quantum computations by approaching the complete-basis-set limit through coupling the DBBSC approach, applied to any given variational ansatz, to an on-the-fly crafting of basis sets specifically adapted to a given system and user-defined qubit budget. The resulting approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties (e.g. dipole moments), but can also serve as a classical, a posteriori, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations with expected applications in drug design and materials science.

In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching.

However, on-chip device performance based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by propagation losses arising from surface roughness and corrugations. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially smooth these features and thereby increase photonic performance, but no ALE process has been reported for LN. Here, we report an isotropic ALE process for $x$-cut MgO-doped LN using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$/Ar plasmas. We observe an etch rate of $1.59 \\pm 0.02$ nm/cycle with a synergy of $96.9$%.

The process is found to decrease the sidewall surface roughness of TFLN waveguides etched by physical Ar$^+$ milling by 30% without additional wet processing. Our ALE process could be used to smooth sidewall surfaces of TFLN waveguides as a post-processing treatment, thereby increasing the performance of TFLN nanophotonic devices and enabling new integrated photonic device capabilities.

Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of $\\mathcal{O}((\\log N)^c)$, compared to $\\mathcal{O}(N^c)$ in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible.
