This effects the usual Lorentz transformation. In addition it acts on a Dirac bi-spinor. The operator is essentially a Hamiltonian that can be used to write an equation of motion for a relativistic spinor. This turns out to be the Dirac equation for electrons in standard form.

They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. This work presents the design of a differential pumping system, enabling, for the first time, continuous operation of our kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system successfully maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of optical turbulence in the Atmospheric Surface Layer (ASL) at Muztagh-ata site during on-site testing. We utilized ultrasonic anemometers positioned on a 30-meter tower to collect and process data at five height levels, obtaining data from October 1, 2021 to the present. We investigated the behavior of optical turbulence parameters (\\(C_n^2\\) and seeing \\(\\varepsilon\\)) in the ASL. Nighttime \\(C_n^2\\) primarily fluctuated in the range of \\(10^{-16}\\) to \\(10^{-14}\\), exhibiting an exponential decrease with height. During the day, it showed a \\(h^{-0.82}\\) dependency, while at night, it displayed a \\(h^{-0.48}\\) dependency. Additionally, we presented the distribution of seeing across different layers within the ASL, showing a gradual decrease with increasing height, with a median seeing of 0.24 arcseconds at nighttime and 0.48 arcseconds at daytime between 6-30m. We investigated the relationship between surface temperature inversion, seeing in the ASL, and wind speed at the site. Our results show that under temperature inversion conditions, seeing significantly improves and is often accompanied by low to moderate wind speeds, while high wind speeds are usually associated with poorer seeing. Preliminary calculations and observational results, combined with the high altitude and unique geographical location, suggest that Muztagh-ata site has the potential to be an outstanding optical astronomical observatory in the western plateau of china.

The individual building blocks are designed and optimised by three-dimensional full-wave simulations and scaled up using a circuit approach. The paper investigates the scalability and robustness of the design approach. Our study demonstrates that the proposed approach of performing unitary matrix completion can be applied to any arbitrary matrices.

While optical structures such as waveguide crossbar arrays and Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based meshes serve as photonic equivalents to the systolic arrays, the disparity between the two input matrices for multiplication -- one using optical signals and the other with system-defined parameters -- gives rise to a bottleneck in modern machine-learning tasks, such as evaluating attention scores in large language models.

Adjoint-based design of compact on-chip freeform optical modules enables precise control of light flow without bulky waveguide coupling schemes. The operation of a $4\\times4$ photonic systolic array is numerically verified, achieving a theoretical computation density of $6.2~\\mathrm{PMACs}/\\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.

Specifically, we generate two, 25 GHz frequency combs and use an optical filter to explore coherent down-mixing to baseband of comb spectral components across microwave, millimeter wave, and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The exceptional noise performance of the optoelectronic mixer enables the phase-coherent measurement of millimeter-wave and THz frequency combs with an Allan deviation of 10^-13/t for a measurement time of t. We further investigate the dependence of conversion loss on the reverse bias voltage and photocurrent. The experimental results indicate that we can minimize the conversion loss by operating the photodiode at an optimal voltage and maximum available photocurrent.

However, conventional FWI faces challenges such as cycle-skipping and high computational costs. Recently, deep learning method has emerged as a promising solution for efficient velocity estimation. We develop DiffusionVel, a data-driven technique based on the state-of-the-art generative diffusion models (GDMs) with integration of multiple information including seismic data, background velocity, geological knowledge, and well logs. We use two separate conditional GDMs, namely the seismic-data GDM and the well-log GDM, and an unconditional GDM, i.e., the geology-oriented GDM, to adapt the generated velocity model to the constraints of seismic data, well logs, and prior geological knowledge, respectively. Besides, the background velocity can be incorporated into the generated velocity model with a low-pass filter. The generation of these GDM are then combined together with a weighted summation in the sampling process. We can flexibly control the constraints from each information by adjusting the weighting factors. We make a comprehensive comparison between the proposed DiffusionVel and three previously-developed methods including conventional FWI, InversionNet, and VelocityGAN by using the OpenFWI datasets and the Hess VTI model example. The test results demonstrate that the proposed DiffusionVel method predicts the velocity model reasonably by integrating multiple information effectively.         ",

The FFFC spectrum ranges from 1 to 2 microns, which is the most demanded range in fiber optics. The theoretical model presented in the work is used to derive analytical expressions for the parameter D, taking into account the second-order group velocity dispersion. To validate the methodology, the parameter D is measured for a standard single-mode SMF-28 fiber. The proposed method enables the precise measurement of the parameter D with high accuracy across a broad spectral range in a relatively short time.         ",

The data revealed that second order photon correlation, $g^2(0)$ value decreases substantially from 0.21 in CdTe to 0.02 in $CdTe_{0.25}Se_{0.75}$ QDs. They also exhibited deterministic emissions with an increase in ON time exceeding 95% of the total time. This was accompanied by an increased photon count rate, substantially reduced blinking events, and extended single particle ON-time. The increased single photon emission in $CdTe_{x}Se_{1-x}$ is attributed to very fast electron trapping to dense trap states, which suppresses the multiexciton recombination.         ",

    "abstract": "           Microring resonators (MRRs) are essential components in large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs), but programming these circuits with high precision and efficiency remains an unsolved challenge. Conventional methods rely on complex calibration processes that are both time-consuming and often inaccurate, limiting the scalability of PICs. This work introduces an innovative control method called chip-in-the-loop optimization (ChiL) that addresses this challenge by offering high scalability, precision, fast convergence, and robustness. ChiL reduces the calibration complexity for an $N$ devices system from $O(k^N)$ to a single-shot measurement, while maintaining a record-high precision over 9-bit in the presence of system imperfections, including fabrication variances, thermal crosstalk, and temperature drift. Using ChiL, we experimentally demonstrate a photonic solver for computing matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors with errors on the order of $10^{-4}$. Additionally, we achieve a photonic neural network (PNN) with accuracy and a confusion matrix identical to those of digital computers. ChiL offers a practical approach for programming large-scale PICs and bridges the gap between analog photonic and digital electronic computing and signal processing in both scale and precision.

    "abstract": "           In quantum foundations, there is growing interest in the program of reconstructing the quantum formalism from clear physical principles. These reconstructions are formulated in an operational framework, deriving the formalism from information-theoretic principles. It has been recognized that this project is in tension with standard Psi-ontic interpretations. This paper presupposes that the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) (i) is a worthwhile project and (ii) puts pressure on Psi-ontic interpretations. Where does this leave us? Prima facie, it seems that Psi-epistemic interpretations perfectly fit the spirit of information-based reconstructions. However, Psi-epistemic interpretations, understood as saying that the wave functions represents one's knowledge about a physical system, recently have been challenged on technical and conceptual grounds. More importantly, for some researchers working on reconstructions, the lesson of successful reconstructions is that the wave function does not represent objective facts about the world. Since knowledge is a factive concept, this speaks against epistemic interpretations. In this paper, I discuss whether Psi-doxastic interpretations constitute a reasonable alternative. My thesis is that if we want to engage QRP with Psi-doxastic interpretations, then we should aim at a reconstruction that is spelled out in non-factive experiential terms.         ",

    "title": "Quantum Locking of Intrinsic Spin Squeezed State in Earth-field-range Magnetometry",
    "abstract": "           In the Earth-field range, the nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effect has been a bottleneck limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of atomic magnetometry from physical mechanism. To break this bottleneck, various techniques are introduced to suppress the NLZ effect. Here we revisit the spin dynamics in the Earth-field-range magnetometry and identify the existence of the intrinsic spin squeezed state (SSS) generated from the geomagnetically induced NLZ effect with the oscillating squeezing degree and squeezing axis. Such oscillating features of the SSS prevent its direct observation and as well, accessibility to magnetic sensing. To exploit quantum advantage of the intrinsic SSS in the Earth-field-range magnetometry, it's essential to lock the oscillating SSS to a persistent one. Hence, we develop a quantum locking technique to achieve a persistent SSS, benefiting from which the sensitivity of the Earth-field-range magnetometer is quantum-enhanced. This work presents an innovative way turning the drawback of NLZ effect into the quantum advantage and opens a new access to quantum-enhanced magnetometry in the Earth-field range.         ",

    "abstract": "           The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.         ",

    "abstract": "           The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.         ",

An acceleration signal is applied and the resulting performance is seen to be close to the optimum possible for the time-space area enclosed according to quantum theory.

    "abstract": "           We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.

Physically, we recognize that the topological quantization emerges purely from virtual transitions contributing to the optical response.

In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.         ",

On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.
