    "abstract": "           Advancements in light modulator technology have been driving discoveries and progress across various fields. The problem of large-scale coherent optical control of atomic quantum systems-including cold atoms, ions, and solid-state color centers-presents among the most stringent requirements. This motivates a new generation of high-speed large-scale modulator technology with the following requirements: (R1) operation at a design wavelength of choice in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, (R2) a scalable technology with a high channel density (> 100mm-2 ), (R3) a high modulation speed (> 100MHz), and (R4) a high extinction ratio (> 20 dB). To fulfill these requirements, we introduce a modulator technology based on piezoelectrically actuated silicon nitride resonant waveguide gratings fabricated on 200mm diameter silicon wafers with CMOS compatible processes. We present a proof-of-concept device with 4 x 4 individually addressable 50 {mu}m x 50 {mu}m pixels or channels, each containing a resonant waveguide grating with a ~ 780 nm design wavelength, supporting > 100MHz modulation speeds, and a spectral response with > 20 dB extinction.

The quantum defect parameters for the measured Rydberg series are the most precise obtained to date.

The precision of the measured quantum defects allow for the calculation of Rydberg electric-dipole transitions and fine-structure intervals extrapolated from high principal quantum numbers, to rival that of sophisticated many-body relativistic calculations carried out at low Rydberg principal quantum numbers. We quantitatively predict the contributions to the quantum defect parameters from core polarization and core penetration of Cs inner shell electrons.

    "title": "Quantum Probabilities Are Objective Degrees of Epistemic Justification",
    "abstract": "           QBism is currently one of the most widely discussed 'subjective' interpretations of quantum mechanics. Its key move is to say that quantum probabilities are personalist Bayesian probabilities and that the quantum state represents subjective degrees of belief. Even probability-one predictions are considered subjective assignments expressing the agent's highest possible degree of certainty about what they will experience next. For most philosophers and physicists this means that QBism is simply too subjective. Even those who agree with QBism that the wave function should not be reified and that we should look for alternatives to standard Psi-ontic interpretations often argue that QBism must be abandoned because it detaches science from objectivity. The problem is that from the QBist perspective it is hard to see how objectivity could enter science. In this paper, I introduce and motivate an interpretation of quantum mechanics that takes QBism as a starting point, is consistent with all its virtues, but allows objectivity to enter from the get-go. This is the view that quantum probabilities should be understood as objective degrees of epistemic justification.         ",

Physical models offer understanding but are difficult to validate and parameterize. Therefore, automated machine-learning methods (ML) are necessary to evaluate models with experimental data. Bayesian methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization for likelihood-free inference (EP-BOLFI), stand out as they capture uncertainties in models and data while granting meaningful parameterization. An important topic is prolonging battery lifetime, which is limited by degradation, such as the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth. As a case study, we apply EP-BOLFI to parametrize SEI growth models with synthetic and real degradation data. EP-BOLFI allows for incorporating human expertise in the form of suitable feature selection, which improves the parametrization. We show that even under impeded conditions, we achieve correct parameterization with reasonable uncertainty quantification, needing less computational effort than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Additionally, the physically reliable summary statistics show if parameters are strongly correlated and not unambiguously identifiable. Further, we investigate Bayesian alternately subsampled quadrature (BASQ), which calculates model probabilities, to confirm electron diffusion as the best theoretical model to describe SEI growth during battery storage.

The SOI waveguide's dimensions are optimized to support the hybridization of the fundamental transverse magnetic ($TM_0$) and the first higher transverse electric ($TE_1$) mode. This design allows for efficient and nearly equal power coupling between these two modes, resulting in high-contrast interference when starting from the amorphous PCM state. The PCM's phase transition induces a differential change in the modal effective index, enabling high-contrast transmittance modulation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate a multilevel transmission with a high contrast of nearly 14 dB, when the amorphous region's length is varied incrementally, enabling multi-bit storage. The transmittance is maximized in the fully crystalline state with an insertion loss below 0.1 dB. The HMI can also operate as a quasi-pure phase shifter when partially amorphized, making it suitable for Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These characteristics make the proposed device a promising candidate for applications in photonic memories and neuromorphic computing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.

Photonic integrated circuits and interconnects have been demonstrated for scalable communications and optical domain transduction in these systems. Due to energy and area constraints, many of these devices need enhanced light-matter interaction, provided by photonic resonators. A key challenge, however, for using these resonators is the sensitivity of resonance wavelength to process variations and thermal fluctuations. While thermo-optical tuning methods are typically employed at room temperature to mitigate this problem, the thermo-optic effect is ineffective at 4K. To address this issue, we demonstrate a non-volatile approach to tune the resonance of photonic resonators using integrated phase-change materials (PCMs) at cryogenic temperatures.

We present a Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications, we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra. Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier coefficients with $\\mathbf{O}(\\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior approaches with linear cost.         ",

    "abstract": "           The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.         ",

Since there is no up-to-date estimate of the integrated luminosity uncertainties arising from metrology effects at ILC, here we review the metrology requirements for the targeted precision of $\\mathcal{L}$ at foreseen ILC center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV, 250 GeV, 500 GeV and 1 TeV, using small-angle Bhabha scattering.
