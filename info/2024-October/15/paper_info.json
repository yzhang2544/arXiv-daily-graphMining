    "abstract": "           We present measurements of hyperfine structure (HFS) of the $nP_J$ Rydberg states for large principal quantum number $n$ range ($n=41-55$) employing the microwave spectroscopy in an ultra-cold cesium Rydberg ensemble. A microwave field with 30-$\\mu$s duration couples the $ nS \\to nP $ transition, yielding a narrow linewidth spectroscopy that approaches the Fourier limit, which allows us to resolve the hyperfine structure of $ nP_J $ states. By analyzing the hyperfine splittings of $nP_J$ states, we determine the magnetic-dipole HFS coupling constant $\\bar{A}_{HFS,P_{1/2}}=3.760(26) ~$GHz for $P_{1/2}$ state, $\\bar{A}_{HFS,P_{3/2}}= 0.718(27)~$GHz, and $ \\bar{B}_{HFS,P_{3/2}}= -0.084(102)~$GHz for $P_{3/2}$ state, respectively. Systematic uncertainties caused by stray electromagnetic field, microwave field power and Rydberg interaction are analyzed. This measurement is significant for the investigation of Rydberg electrometry and quantum simulation with dipole interaction involving $nP_J$ state.         ",

    "abstract": "           Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.

    "abstract": "           Silicon modulators have garnered considerable attention owing to their potential applications in high-density integration and high-speed modulation. However, they are increasingly challenged by the limited 3 dB bandwidth as the demand for modulation speed in optical communications continues to rise, impeding their ability to compete with modulators made of thin-film lithium niobate. This bandwidth limitation arises because of the parasitic resistance and capacitance in the PN junction of the silicon modulators. This study demonstrates the first silicon modulator exceeding 110 GHz without any resonant structure using a tunable time-frequency equalization technique. This substantial breakthrough enables on-off keying modulation at a rate of 140 Gbaud without digital signal processing. These accomplishments represent the highest bandwidth and maximum baud rate achieved without digital signal processing in an all-silicon modulator, reaching the testing limitations of the experimental system. This opens the possibility of attaining modulation rates of up to 200 or even 300 Gbaud by adopting design strategies such as slow light and technologies such as digital signal processing. This advancement extends the speed capabilities of silicon modulators to the level of thin-film lithium niobate modulators, thereby promoting their application in the broader array of fields, such as linear-drive pluggable transceivers.

This was achieved via adiabatic coupling between a tapered optical fiber and a tapered on-chip photonic waveguide coupled to the photonic crystal cavity. The collection efficiency of a dot in a photonic crystal cavity was measured to be 5 times greater via the tapered optical fiber compared to collection by a microscope objective lens above the cavity. The single photon source was also characterized by second order photon correlations measurements giving g(2)(0)=0.17 under non-resonant excitation. Numerical calculations demonstrate that the collection efficiency could be further increased by improving the dot-cavity coupling and by increasing the overlap length of the tapered fiber with the on-chip waveguide. An adiabatic coupling of near unity is predicted for an overlap length of 5 microns.         ",

    "abstract": "           The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000\u00b0C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400\u00b0C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity of greater than -0.35nm/\u00b0C within the temperature range of 50\u00b0C to 440\u00b0C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications.

Since these interactions are by definition non-reciprocal, there have been very few options for real-space implementations in integrated photonics. In this work, we show that real-space asymmetric couplings are readily achievable in integrated photonic systems through time-domain dynamic modulation. We experimentally study this concept using a two-resonator photonic molecule produced in a lithium niobate on insulator platform that is electro-optically modulated by rf stimuli. We demonstrate the dynamic tuning of the Hatano-Nelson coupling between the resonators, surpassing the asymmetry that has been achieved in previous work, to reach an EP for the first time. We are additionally able to flip the relative sign of the couplings for opposite directions by going past the EP. Using this capability, we show that the through-chain transport can be configured to exhibit both giant (60 dB) optical contrast as well as photonic gyration or non-reciprocal pi phase contrast.

The method consists of two primary components: an error amplification module (EAM) and a digital frequency locking module (DFLM) based on FPGA. The EAM integrates a configurable frequency generator (CFG), a configurable frequency multiplier (CFM) and a mixer,to process the laser pulse alongside a high-stability reference source, such as an atomic clock.

    "abstract": "           Optical antennas have been extensively employed to manipulate the photophysical properties of single photon emitters. Coupling between an emitter and a given resonant mode of an optical antenna depends mainly on three parameters: spectral overlap, relative distance, and relative orientation between the emitter's transition dipole moment and the antenna. While the first two have been already extensively demonstrated, achieving full coupling control remains unexplored due to the challenges in manipulating at the same time both the position and orientation of single molecules. Here, we use the DNA origami technique to assemble a dimer optical antenna and position a single fluorescent molecule at the antenna gap with controlled orientation, predominately parallel or perpendicular to the antenna's main axis. We study the coupling for both conditions through fluorescence measurements correlated with scanning electron microscopy images, revealing a 5-fold higher average fluorescence intensity when the emitter is aligned with the antenna's main axis and a maximum fluorescence enhancement of ~ 1400-fold. A comparison to realistic numerical simulations suggests that the observed distribution of fluorescence enhancement arises from small variations in emitter orientation and gap size. This work establishes DNA origami as a versatile platform to fully control the coupling between emitters and optical antennas, trailblazing the way for self-assembled nanophotonic devices with optimized and more homogenous performance.

Nevertheless, its mechanism at the atomic level has been persistently misunderstood for more than a century. In this work, we demonstrate that the racemization of amino acid molecules in aqueous environments can occur simultaneously by two pathways via the carboxyl (COOH) and amino (NH2) groups. Behind this result, the quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) effect plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by the tunneling hindrance of the NH2 reaction and the tunneling enhancement of the COOH reaction. Notably, the disparity in the QMT effect leads to a crossover between the COOH and NH2 reactions within 200-257 K, such that NH2 reactions dominate at high temperatures and COOH reactions dominate at low temperatures. Our work emphasizes the significance of QMT effect in the racemization of amino acids and therefore introduces a dual-path coexistence mechanism, offering valuable insights into the origin of homochirality in extreme environments of the early Earth.

Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins.

As the construction of this data is computationally demanding, many schemes for identifying the most important structures have been proposed. Here, we compare the performance of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) for quantum liquid water at ambient conditions trained to data sets constructed using random sampling as well as various flavors of active learning based on query by committee. Contrary to the common understanding of active learning, we find that for a given data set size, random sampling leads to smaller test errors for structures not included in the training process. In our analysis we show that this can be related to small energy offsets caused by a bias in structures added in active learning, which can be overcome by using instead energy correlations as an error measure that is invariant to such shifts. Still, all HDNNPs yield very similar and accurate structural properties of quantum liquid water, which demonstrates the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the training set construction algorithm even when trained to as few as 200 structures. However, we find that for active learning based on preliminary potentials, a reasonable initial data set is important to avoid an unnecessary extension of the covered configuration space to less relevant regions.

The latter can be realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental observations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we survey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic roots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize state-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron models, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\u00f6hlich Hamiltonian that applies at weak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used for solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections are devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose polarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra obtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body and Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to studies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in low-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation; and to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed discussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic impurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and extensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or strong interactions relevant for correlated electrons.

    "abstract": "           The dynamic properties of materials utilized in architecture or engineering applications can significantly affect their performance under dynamic or impact loading conditions. To evaluate such behavior, force transducers are commonly employed in testing. However, the calibration of force transducers is typically limited to static conditions and relies solely on gravitational forces exerted on standard masses. Thus, assessing the uncertainty in force measurements using force transducers during dynamic loading conditions remains a challenging task, presenting a significant obstacle in accurately characterizing the dynamic behavior of materials. In this work, an optical technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of wires subjected to impact tensile loads is presented. The wire under test is subjected to an impact tensile load by applying the inertial force of a rigid mass, which is supported by utilizing an aerostatic linear bearing with sufficiently small friction. The inertial force applied to the wire can be determined by multiplying the mass of the rigid mass by its acceleration, where the acceleration can be measured employing a Michelson type optical interferometer. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of a tungsten wire under impact tensile loading conditions.         ",

    "abstract": "           TianQin proposes to detect gravitational wave signals by using laser interferometry. However, laser propagation effect introduces a potential noise factor for TianQin. In this work, we used MHD simulations to obtain the space magnetic field and plasma distributions during an extremely strong solar eruption, and based on the magnetohydrodynamic simulation result, we investigate laser propagation noise for TianQin. For the extremely strong solar eruption event, we find that the laser propagation noise closely approaches 100\\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination; While the laser propagation noise is still about 30\\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for time-delay interferometry X combination. In addition, we investigate the laser propagation noise for 12 cases with different solar wind conditions. Our finding reveals a linear correlation between the laser propagation noise and several space weather parameters, e.g., solar wind dynamic pressure, Sym-H, and $D$st, where the correlation coefficients for solar wind dynamic pressure is strongest. Combining the cumulative distribution of solar wind dynamic pressure from 1999 to 2021 with the linear correlation between solar wind dynamic pressure and laser propagation noise, we have determined that the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise to be greater than 30\\% of TianQin's displacement noise requirement for Michelson combination over the entire solar activity week is about 15\\%. In addition, we find that time-delay interferometry can suppress the laser propagation noise, and reduce the occurrence rate of the laser propagation noise exceeding 30\\% of TianQin's requirement to less than 1\\%.

The main purpose of this work is to show how this theory works for conservative systems and the quantum-classical transition is carried out in a continuous and smooth way, being equivalent to a nonlinear differential wave equation which contains a transition parameter ranging continuously from one to zero and covering all dynamical regimes in-between the two extreme quantum and classical regimes.

The single atom has an intrinsic momentum uncertainty comparable to a single photon, which serves as a movable slit obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The atom's momentum wavefunction is dynamically tunable by the tweezer laser power, which enables observation of an interferometric visibility reduction at a shallower trap, demonstrating the quantum nature of this interferometer.

In our previous work [Y. Shi et al., Phys. Rev.

This method is particularly well-suited for multi-kilojoule petawatt-class laser systems like SG-II UP, which are designed with multiple linearly polarized beamlets. Utilizing three-dimensional kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we examine critical factors for a proof-of-principle experiment, such as laser polarization, relative pulse delay, phase offset, pointing stability, and target configuration, and their impact on magnetic field generation. Our general conclusion is that the approach is very robust and can be realized under a wide range of laser parameters and plasma conditions. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the axial magnetic field configuration, azimuthal electron current, and electron and ion orbital angular momentum densities. Supported by a simple model, our analysis shows that the axial magnetic field decays due to the expansion of hot electrons.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.

Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth.

Here we outline and characterize schemes to map the state of photons onto long-lived but optically-inaccessible collective states of noble-gas spins. The mapping employs coherent spin-exchange interaction arising from random collisions with alkali vapor.

    "abstract": "           We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.         ",

    "abstract": "           The purpose of this paper is to study the delay-dependent coherent feedback dynamics by focusing on one typical realization, i.e., a two-atom quantum network whose feedback loop is closed by a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, an initially excited two-level atom can emit a photon into the waveguide, where the propagating photon can be reflected by the terminal mirror of the waveguide or absorbed by the other atom, thus constructing various coherent feedback loops. We show that there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide, which can be controlled by the feedback loop length and the coupling strengths between the atoms and waveguide. The photonic states in the waveguide are analyzed in both the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions is better understood based on a comprehensive analysis using both domains. Interestingly, we clarify that this quantum coherent feedback network can be mathematically modeled as a linear control system with multiple delays, which are determined by the distances between atoms and the terminal mirror of the semi-infinite waveguide. Therefore, based on time-delayed linear control system theory, the influence of delays on the stability of the quantum state evolution and the steady-state atomic and photonic states is investigated, for both small and large delays.

    "abstract": "           Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\\hat x,\\hat p]=i\\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \\to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\\Delta x \\Delta p\\geq \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.

Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\u00f6dinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.         ",

    "abstract": "           Naturally occurring background radiation is a source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. To characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background events in silicon substrates located inside a millikelvin refrigerator, an environment representative of superconducting qubit systems. We measured the background spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, and obtained the average event rate and the integrated power deposition. In a 25 mm^2 area and the thinner substrate, these values are 0.023 events per second and 4.9 keV/s, counting events that deposit at least 40 keV. We find the background spectrum to be nearly featureless. Its intensity decreases by a factor of 40,000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for silicon substrates 0.5 mm thick. We find the cryogenic measurements to be in good agreement with predictions based on measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. No free parameters are required to predict the background spectra in the silicon substrates. The good agreement between measurements and predictions allow assessment of the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic background sources and their dependence on substrate thickness. Our spectroscopic measurements are performed with superconducting microresonators that transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. We find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events depositing E<1.5 MeV, while nucleons among the cosmic-ray secondary particles cause most events that deposit more energy. These results suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits.         ",

    "abstract": "           The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.         ",

The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: for constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient on most input states, is also classically simulable on most input states.

    "abstract": "           The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.         ",
