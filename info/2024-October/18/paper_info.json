The quantum excitation contribution of such a wiggler to the electron beam emittance in a storage ring should be carefully evaluated when small emittance is desired. What found in literature is an approximate formula. Here we present a more exact result, which is of value for future light source development.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurate characterization of quantum yield is crucial to the reconstruction of energy depositions in silicon at the eV scale. This work presents a new method for experimentally calculating quantum yield using vacuum UV-sensitive silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), which can be used to determine the probabilities that a UV photon absorbed in a silicon crystal will produce one, two, or three electron-hole pairs. Results are presented which fully constrain the distribution at photon energies up to 7.75eV. This method works by exploiting the saturation of photon detection efficiency which occurs when these devices are biased sufficiently high above their avalanche breakdown voltage. The measured quantum yield values are lower than those that have been previously reported by experimental data and modelling -- this is expected to impact the sensitivity of experiments searching for light dark matter through direct detection in semiconductors, and should also be taken into account when characterizing the performance of UV photodetectors with high quantum efficiency. Measurements have been taken using a Hamamatsu VUV4 and an FBK VUV-HD3 device, showing good agreements between devices, and at a range of temperatures from 163-233K. The validity of the method is assessed using supplementary measurements of absolute photon detection efficiency, and an additional novel method of measuring average quantum yield using DC current-voltage measurements of SiPMs is presented and used for corroboration.

Traditionally, the separation of optical SAM and OAM from total AM relied on vector potentials, leading to gauge-dependent ambiguities and limiting analysis to vacuum conditions, without accounting for material systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a field-derivative approach that constructs optical AM from the time derivatives of electric and magnetic fields, allowing for gauge-independent evaluations of SAM and OAM, even in material systems. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: the scattering of circularly polarized (CP) Gaussian beams by a single gold nanoparticle, and the focusing of CP beams and linearly polarized (LP) optical vortex (OV) beams by an aplanatic lens. Our results reveal that SOC is highly dependent on particle size in scattering, with larger particles exhibiting significant OAM loss, while SOC occurs during CP beam focusing, but not with LP OV beams. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked optical SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

Here we present a chip-scale, fully integrated monolithic, non-switching optoelectronic voltage conversion platform capable of high gain, bootstrap-free boost-mode operation across several orders of magnitude in power density and voltage scale. Using the bidirectional coupling between LEDs and PV cells with identical active layer materials, our chip-scale, single-die strategy eliminates Stokes losses while improving key parameters like physical footprint, series resistance, and photon leakage by orders of magnitude over implementations using multiple packaged, discrete components. Moreover, by exploiting the large \u00e9tendue of NIR-transparent semi-insulating InP substrates and the atomically smooth, void-free interface of lattice-matched epitaxial growth, simulations indicate that our InGaAsP architecture's photon transport simultaneously provides a > 60x increase in current density and > 50x reduction in non-radiative recombination losses compared with a multiple-die solution while simultaneously reducing fabrication complexity and improving mechanical robustness.

    "abstract": "           Ultrafast pulses, particularly those with durations under 100 femtoseconds, are crucial in achieving unprecedented precision and control in light-matter interactions. However, conventional on-chip photonic platforms are not inherently designed for ultrafast time-domain operations, posing a significant challenge in achieving essential parameters such as high peak power and high temporal resolution. This challenge is particularly pronounced when propagating through dispersive integrated waveguides, unlike classical applications where dispersion is typically near-zero or linear. In addressing this challenge, we present a design methodology for ultrafast pulse propagation in dispersive integrated waveguides, specifically focused on enhancing the time-domain characteristics of one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs). The proposed methodology aims to determine the optimal structural parameters for achieving maximum peak power, enhanced temporal resolution, and extended pulse storage duration during ultrafast pulse propagation. To validate this approach, we design and fabricate two specialized 1DGWs on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. A digital finite impulse response (FIR) model, trained with both transmission and phase measurement data, is employed to obtain ultrafast time-domain characteristics, enabling easy extraction of these results. Our approach achieves a 2.78-fold increase in peak power and reduces pulse broadening by 24%, resulting in a smaller sacrifice in temporal resolution. These results can possibly pave the way for advanced light-matter interactions within dispersive integrated waveguides.         ",

We investigate the stochastic dynamics associated with high-order exceptional points with a particular eye towards optimizing sensing performance by developing a theoretical framework based on pseudo-Hermiticity. Our analysis reveals three distinct types of frequency responses to external perturbations. A broad type of stochastic resonance is uncovered where, as the noise amplitude increases, the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a global maximum rapidly but with a slow decaying process afterwards, indicating achievable high performance in a wide range of the noise level.

Fortunately, new multicore optical fibers create the opportunity for application coexistence with data traffic, creating expansive multifunctional networks.

Wavefront sensing with a Shack-Hartmann is challenging, as subapertures located further away from the laser launch position image an increasingly elongated perspective of the laser guide star. Large detectors can be used to adequately pack and sample the images on the detector, however, this increases readout noise and limits the design space available for the wavefront sensor. To tackle this challenge, we propose an original solution based on nano-engineered meta-optics tailored to produce a spatially varying anamorphic image scale compression. We present meta-lenslet array designs that can deliver ~100% of the full anamorphic image size reduction required for focal lengths down to 8mm, and greater than 50% image size reduction for focal lengths down to 2mm.

A mechanical disk of microscale volume is used as a small-amplitude oscillating probe that monitors the fluid at rest in thermal equilibrium, while the oscillation is detected by optomechanical transduction within a sub-millisecond measurement time, thanks to an optimized signal collection. An original analytical model for fluid-structure interactions is used to extract from these measurements the rheological properties of liquids over the frequency range 100 MHz - 1 GHz. This new micro-rheology method is calibrated by measurements on liquid water, in which we observe pronounced compressibility effects above 500 MHz, but which we show remains Newtonian all over the explored range. In contrast, measurements reveal that liquid 1-decanol exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior, with a frequency-dependent viscosity associated to several relaxation frequencies in the UHF. Our data agree well with an extended Maxwell model for the viscosity of this alcohol, involving two relaxation times of 797 and 151 picoseconds, which are respectively analyzed as supramolecular and intramolecular relaxation processes. A shear elastic response of the liquid appears at the highest frequencies, compatible with the entropic elasticity of molecules as they attempt to uncurl, and whose value enables estimating the volume of a single molecule of liquid.

    "abstract": "           Tailored light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry. While strong light-matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly-excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, due to the lack of pulse shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach unravels a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.

    "title": "Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry",
    "abstract": "           The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with $\\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies over the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For cases, where $\\Delta$-ML method might be favored, such as small test set regimes, the MF$\\Delta$-ML method is shown to be more efficient than conventional $\\Delta$-ML.         ",

    "abstract": "           In the canonical approach of loop quantum gravity, arguably the most important outstanding problem is finding and interpreting solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint. In this work, we demonstrate that methods of machine learning are in principle applicable to this problem. We consider $U(1)$ BF theory in 3 dimensions, quantized with loop quantum gravity methods. In particular, we formulate a master constraint corresponding to Hamilton and Gauss constraints using loop quantum gravity methods. To make the problem amenable for numerical simulation we fix a graph and introduce a cutoff on the kinematical degrees of freedom, effectively considering $U_q(1)$ BF theory at a root of unity. We show that the Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS) ansatz can be used to numerically solve the constraints efficiently and accurately. We compute expectation values and fluctuations of certain observables and compare them with exact results or exact numerical methods where possible. We also study the dependence on the cutoff.         ",

    "abstract": "           The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.         ",

    "abstract": "           Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.
