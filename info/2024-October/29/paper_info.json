    "abstract": "           Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) have the potential to exhibit higher power conversion efficiencies than traditional photovoltaics (PVs), with a broad range of applicability from waste recovery systems to aerospace solutions. They operate by preferentially radiating above bandgap photons via a high temperature optical emitter, whose spectrum is tuned through choice of materials and geometry. For TPV to be practically implemented, the emitters must be designed with a simple optical structure while remaining thermally stable. Here, we demonstrate coating/substrate bilayer thin films as a solution to these design criteria. With the optical data of 53 high melting point materials, we simulate the bilayer emissivity as a function of coating thickness for each thermochemically stable emitter operating at 1,800 \u00b0C. Emitter-cell systems are characterized by the cell power density and TPV conversion efficiency, constituting a TPV performance metric space. For a given bilayer and bandgap these coating thickness parameterized figures of merit form a performance metric curve, with the best points defining a tradeoff zone. We screen the resulting performance metric curves, identifying trends based on optical properties of the system, finding a high degree of tunability through the material selection step. For GaSb cells, >49% efficiency is achieved using AlN/W, a 5.6% increase over bulk W. By calculating the figures of merit for all systems with varying bandgap, we find unique emitter choices per PV cell for achieving the highest potential efficiency. Our materials screening approach uses physical data to identify improvements to emitters for experimental TPV designs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Understanding the molecular-level structure and dynamics of ice surfaces is crucial for deciphering several chemical, physical, and atmospheric processes. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is the most prominent tool for probing the molecular-level structure of the air--ice interface as it is a surface-specific technique, but the molecular interpretation of SFG spectra is challenging. This study utilizes a machine-learning potential, along with dipole and polarizability models trained on ab initio data, to calculate the SFG spectrum of the air--ice interface. At temperatures below ice surface premelting, our simulations support the presence of a proton-ordered arrangement at the Ice Ih surface, similar to that seen in Ice XI. Additionally, our simulations provide insight into the assignment of SFG peaks to specific molecular configurations where possible and assess the contribution of subsurface layers to the overall SFG spectrum. These insights enhance our understanding and interpretation of vibrational studies of environmental chemistry at the ice surface.         ",

The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.         ",

Central to this effort is the challenge of designing optical systems that are optimized for specific applications. Traditional design methods often rely on trial-and-error methods, or on models that approximate the particle as a point dipole, which only works for particles much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. In this work, we present a general inverse design framework based on the Maxwell stress tensor formalism capable of simultaneously designing all components of the system, while being applicable to particles of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Notably, we show that with small modifications to the baseline formulation, it is possible to engineer systems capable of attracting, repelling, accelerating, oscillating, and trapping particles. We demonstrate our method using various case studies where we simultaneously design the particle and its environment, with particular focus on free-space particles and particle-metalens systems.

In near-infrared wavelengths, semiconductor laser based chaotic light sources have been extensively studied and experimentally demonstrated. However, in the terahertz (THz) spectral range, due to the lack of effective THz light sources and high-speed detectors, chaos generation in THz semiconductor lasers, e.g., quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), is particularly challenging. Due to the fast intersubband carrier transitions, single mode THz QCLs resemble Class A lasers, where chaos can be hardly excited, even with external perturbations. In this work, we experimentally show a THz chaos source based on a sole multimode THz QCL without any external perturbations. Such a dynamical regime is characterized by the largest Lyapunov exponent associated to the temporal traces of the measured radio frequency (intermode beatnote) signal of the laser. The experimental results and chaos validation are confirmed by simulations of our model based on effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch Equations. To further understand the physical mechanism of the chaos generation in THz QCLs, a reduced model based on two coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau equations is derived from the full model cited above to systematically investigate the effects of the linewidth enhancement factor and group velocity dispersion on the chaotic regime. This model allows us to show that the chaos generation in the THz QCL can be ascribed to the system attaining the defect mediated turbulence regime.         ",

    "abstract": "           Deployment of terahertz communication and spectroscopy systems relies on the availability of low-noise and fast detectors, with plug-and-play capabilities. However, most currently available technologies are stand-alone, discrete components, either slow or susceptible to temperature drifts. Moreover, phase-sensitive schemes are mainly based on bulk crystals and require tight beam focusing. Here, we demonstrate an integrated photonic architecture in thin-film lithium niobate that addresses these challenges by exploiting the electro-optic modulation induced by a terahertz signal onto an optical beam at telecom frequencies. Leveraging on the low optical losses provided by this platform, we integrate a double array of up to 18 terahertz antennas within a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, considerably extending the device collection area and boosting the interaction efficiency between the terahertz signal and the optical beam. We show that the double array coherently builds up the probe modulation through a mechanism of quasi-phase-matching, driven by a periodic terahertz near-field pattern, without physical inversion of the crystallographic domains. The array periodicity controls the detection bandwidth and its central frequency, while the large detection area ensures correct operation with diverse terahertz beam settings. Furthermore, we show that the antennas act as pixels that allow reconstruction of the terahertz beam profile impinging on the detector area. Our on-chip design in thin-film lithium niobate overcomes the detrimental effects of two-photon absorption and fixed phase-matching conditions, which have plagued previously explored electro-optic detection systems, especially in the telecom band, paving the way for more advanced on-chip terahertz systems.

In this paper we study the properties of Dust Acoustic Rogue Waves (DARW) in a cometary environment with positively and negatively charged dust components, kappa distributed - protons and electrons. Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) is derived using reductive perturbation method and analysed for modulational instability. The system is found to be modulationally unstable above some particular value of wave number($k=0.5$), after which the system is unstable. The solution for rogue waves is tested in this environment theoretically. Amplitude and structure of first and second order rogue waves are compared for various plasma parameters. Higher charge number of positive dust, $(z_+ > z_-)$ decreases the amplitude of RWs, while higher number density of positive dust $(n_+>n_-)$ ions increases it. As number density of proton $(n_i)$ increases the amplitude of RW decreases. Peak values increase with number density exponentially for positive and linearly for negative dust ions. It increases linearly with charge number of both positive and negative dust ions. Peak value decreases exponentially for number density of proton.         ",

Here, we demonstrate two figure-9 lasers with repetition rates of 190.6 MHz and 92.4 MHz and introduce the self-designed beam splitter with little spectral impact in the fiber loop to output two interference-free pulses. By numerically processing the spectra of these two pulses, the formation mechanisms of specific spectral features are determined, and the features are consistent with the experimental spectral features of the pulses from the other two ports. Furthermore, by analyzing the pulse propagation of lasers through the interference theory of the figure-9 laser, it is found that the superposition and interference of spectra at the two output ports of the linear arm are the reasons for the severe spectral distortion, rather than the commonly believed nonlinear effects. On the beam splitter where interference occurs, the $p$-components of the two intracavity light beams always interferes with equal intensity, while the $s$-components usually interfere with non-equal intensity, resulting in a large but stable spectral difference between the pulses inside the cavity and the output pulses. These findings can provide new perspectives for simulating spectra that closely resemble experimental results and deepen our understanding of spectral evolution and pulse dynamics of the figure-9 laser.

We then study the photoluminescence (PL) of 1L-TMDCs on which differently sized single Si NSs are placed. We show that the PL spectral shape strongly depends on the emission direction, and that the emission toward the Si NS side (top) with respect to the opposite side (bottom) is the largest at wavelengths between the magnetic dipole and electric dipole Mie resonances of a Si NS.

    "abstract": "           Light-matter interaction plays a pivotal role in pushing forward nanotechnology. A particularly important setup involves a resonating particle, say an emitting molecule or a macroscopic quasi-statically resonating ferromagnetic sphere, that is located inside a cavity. In this paper, we provide an analytic formulation for the exact calculation of the mutual dynamics between a resonant particle and a rectangular cavity in which it is located. The particle is assumed to be small on the wavelength, and thus, its excitation is dominated by a dipolar response that can be described using the discrete dipole approximation and polarizability theory. The dipolar response depends on the particle's polarizability function which encapsulates the particle's materials and geometry, and on the local field acting on the particle. In principle, the latter is nothing more than the backscattering of the particle field by the cavity walls. However, it may be challenging since it involves a three-dimensional singularity subtraction of the Green's function in the cavity and the Green's function in the free space that are differently represented. In this paper, we suggest the use of a ladder-type process involving alternative Green's function representations to calculate the local field in a computationally efficient and numerically stable manner. Using this approach, we solve several strongly coupled particle-cavity systems and calculate the collective resonance frequencies of the system with isotropic, gyrotropic, and chiral particles.

Nontrivial spatial structure of the waveguide modes enriches this picture and uncovers further possibilities. Here, we demonstrate that the effective coupling between $p$-like modes of adjacent photonic waveguides changes its sign depending on their relative orientation vanishing for a proper alignment at a so-called magic angle. Using femtosecond laser-written waveguides, we demonstrate this experimentally for $p$-mode dimers and graphene-like photonic lattices exhibiting quasi-flat bands at this angle. We observe diffraction-free propagation of corner and bulk states providing a robust experimental evidence of a two-dimensional Aharonov-Bohm-like caging in an optically switchable system.         ",

Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.

My overall objective, thus, is to motivate the reconstruction program and to show why philosophers should care. My specific aims are threefold.

Particularly, coupling with circularly polarized fields can break time-reversal symmetry, leading to topological modifications in the band structure. Therefore, chiral optical cavities that host chiral vacuum fields are being sought, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a novel approach to achieving THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) with high-quality factors (>400) using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. Numerical simulations of an optimized structure based on InSb in a small perpendicular magnetic field (~0.2 T) show chiral cavity resonances with near-perfect ellipticity at the surfaces of the central dielectric layer, where one can place atomically thin materials like monolayer graphene. We theoretically estimate an energy gap on the order of 1 meV in graphene when coupled to our proposed chiral cavity, which is potentially measurable in experiments. These THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring new phases in cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken time-reversal symmetry.         ",

The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.

We derive a general relationship among reliability, sensitivity, and systematic error, and demonstrate this relationship using a typical quantum sensing process. That is to measure magnetic fields (as a signal) by a spin-$1/2$ particle and using the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to read out the signal information.

We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.         ",

    "abstract": "           The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains of up to 2.25 dB, comparable to fundamental bounds for up to about 80 atoms in the presence of decoherence. This result is surprising since GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.         ",

    "abstract": "           Entanglement plays a central role in the fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observations provide evidence of quantumness. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and that gravity is quantum. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers and show that the Pancharatnam phase is a tool that qualitatively distinguishes semiclassical from quantum gravity. The semiclassical evolution is equivalent to that of two independent interferometers in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution in the Bloch sphere. By contrast, in the quantum case, the quantum amplitudes are the sources of the gravitational field, inducing entanglement between the two interferometers, and the phase is continuous.         ",
