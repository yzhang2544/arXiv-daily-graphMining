    "abstract": "           Quantum superposition, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, enables systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously, giving rise to probabilistic outcomes. In quantum information science, conditional entropy has become a key metric for quantifying uncertainty in one system given information about another, revealing non-classical correlations that transcend classical physics. This study examines the nature of quantum conditional entropy and reports two key findings. First, it demonstrates that probabilistic outcomes involving quantum superposition arise from work based on information about the eigenstate in a recursive process. Second, it proposes that this extractable work constitutes the energy available to living systems-a concept without a classical analogue-counteracting the natural tendency toward disorder.         ",

    "abstract": "           Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the \"effective\" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones. We present the preliminary results of our study on the influence of the PSF on SNR, image contrast, position resolution, and achievable sample resolution for different pixel sizes.         ",

We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theory, showing that each beam displays its own resonance pattern.

The geometry of the corresponding quantum states is described by the quantum metric which provides a theoretical framework for explaining phenomena that conventional approaches fail to address. The field has become even broader by encompassing non-Hermitian singularities: in addition to Dirac, Weyl nodes, or nodal lines, it is now common to encounter exceptional points, exceptional or Weyl rings, and even Weyl spheres. They give access to fascinating effects that cannot be reached within the Hermitian picture. However, the quantum geometry of non-Hermitian singularities is not a straightforward extension of the Hermitian one, remaining far less understood. Here, we study experimentally and theoretically the dynamics of wave packets at exceptional rings stemming from Dirac points in a photonic honeycomb lattice. First, we demonstrate a transition between conical diffraction and non-Hermitian broadening in real space. Next, we predict and demonstrate a new non-Hermitian effect in the reciprocal space, induced by the non-orthogonality of the eigenstates. We call it transverse non-Hermitian drift, and its description requires biorthogonal quantum metric. The non-Hermitian drift can be used for applications in beam steering.         ",

    "abstract": "           The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000\u00b0C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400\u00b0C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/\u00b0C within the temperature range of 50\u00b0C to 440\u00b0C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications         ",

Traditionally, the separation of optical SAM and OAM from total AM relied on vector potentials, leading to gauge-dependent ambiguities and limiting analysis to vacuum conditions, without accounting for material systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a field-derivative approach that constructs optical AM from the time derivatives of electric and magnetic fields, allowing for gauge-independent evaluations of SAM and OAM, even in material systems. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: the scattering of circularly polarized (CP) Gaussian beams by a single gold nanoparticle, and the focusing of CP beams and linearly polarized (LP) optical vortex (OV) beams by an aplanatic lens. Our results reveal that SOC is highly dependent on particle size in scattering, with larger particles exhibiting significant OAM loss, while SOC occurs during CP beam focusing, but not with LP OV beams. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked optical SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

    "abstract": "           Ultrafast pulses, particularly those with durations under 100 femtoseconds, are crucial in achieving unprecedented precision and control in light-matter interactions. However, conventional on-chip photonic platforms are not inherently designed for ultrafast time-domain operations, posing a significant challenge in achieving essential parameters such as high peak power and high temporal resolution. This challenge is particularly pronounced when propagating through dispersive integrated waveguides, unlike classical applications where dispersion is typically near-zero or linear. In addressing this challenge, we present a design methodology for ultrafast pulse propagation in dispersive integrated waveguides, specifically focused on enhancing the time-domain characteristics of one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs). The proposed methodology aims to determine the optimal structural parameters for achieving maximum peak power, enhanced temporal resolution, and extended pulse storage duration during ultrafast pulse propagation. To validate this approach, we design and fabricate two specialized 1DGWs on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. A digital finite impulse response (FIR) model, trained with both transmission and phase measurement data, is employed to obtain ultrafast time-domain characteristics, enabling easy extraction of these results. Our approach achieves a 2.78-fold increase in peak power and reduces pulse broadening by 24%, resulting in a smaller sacrifice in temporal resolution. These results can possibly pave the way for advanced light-matter interactions within dispersive integrated waveguides.         ",

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.         ",

In this work I introduce a new receiver based on a locally optimal greedy algorithm and apply it to pulse position modulation. The receiver reduces the error probabilities of previously proposed strategies in all signal strength regimes and achieves results comparable with those obtained by numerical optimization of the detection process. In contrast, however, it is conceptually simple and therefore can be scaled to arbitrarily high modulation orders for which numerical methods become intractable. In the photon-starved regime characteristic of deep space optical communication, the greedy receiver approaches the quantum-optimal Helstrom bound on state discrimination error probability. In the regime of few-photon pulses, the error reduction offered over the other methods grows up to an order of magnitude.         ",

We quantify how strain longitudinal to the axis of NV$^{-}$ shifts the excited states in energy, while strain with a component transverse to the NV$^{-}$ axis splits the degeneracies of the $^{3}E$ and $^{1}E$ states. The largest effects are for the optically relevant $^{3}E$ manifold, which splits into $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ with transverse strain. From these responses we extract strain susceptibilities for the $E_{x/y}$ states within the quasi-linear regime. Additionally, we study the many-body dipole matrix elements of the NV$^{-}$ and find a permanent dipole 1.64 D at zero strain, which is somewhat smaller than that obtained from recent density functional theory calculations.
