    "title": "Full Quantum dynamics study for H atom scattering from graphene",
    "abstract": "           This study deals with the understanding of hydrogen atom scattering from graphene, a process critical for exploring C-H bond formation and energy transfer during the atom surface collision. In our previous work (this http URL \\textbf{159}, 194102, (2023)), starting from a cell with 24 carbon atoms treated periodically, we have achieved quantum dynamics (QD) simulations with a reduced-dimensional model (15D) and a simulation in full dimensionality (75D). In the former work, the H atom attacked the top of a single C atom, enabling a comparison of QD simulation results with classical molecular dynamics (cMD). Our approach required the use of sophisticated techniques such as Monte Carlo Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (MCCPD) and Multilayer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), as well as a further development of quantum flux calculations. We could benchmark our calculations by comparison with cMD calculations. We have now refined our method to better mimic experimental conditions. Specifically, rather than sending the H atom to a specific position on the surface, we have employed a plane wave for the H atom in directions parallel to the surface. Key findings for these new simulations include the identification of discrepancies between classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations and experiments, which are attributed to both the potential energy surface (PES) and quantum effects. Additionally, the study sheds light on the role of classical collective normal modes during collisions, providing insights into energy transfer processes. The results validate the robustness of our simulation methodologies and highlight the importance of considering quantum mechanical effects in the study of hydrogen-graphene interactions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Temperature sensors based on GeV color center in diamond are attracting a lot of attention in both science and industry. The industrial adoption of these sensors nevertheless, requires the simplest and cheapest possible design for the sensing element. The original sensor design was based on the measurement of the spectral characteristics of the zero-phonon line. Recently, a modification of this method has been proposed utilizing splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining on temperature from the ratio of two resulting signals. In this analysis, we compare both methods in detail. For measurements near room temperature, both methods have comparable behavior, slightly depended on quality of components used. However, for optimal parameters of a filter at temperatures of about 300 \u00b0C, the new method already outperforms the original by about a factor of 2. Moreover, the sensitivity of the new method remains approximately consistent with that observed at room temperature.         ",

    "abstract": "           Metasurfaces have revolutionized nonlinear and quantum light manipulation in the past decade, enabling the design of materials that can tune polarization, frequency, and direction of light simultaneously. However, tuning of metasurfaces is traditionally achieved by changing their microscopic structure, which does not allow \\emph{in situ} tuning and dynamic optimization of the metasurfaces. In this Letter, we explore the concept of twisted bilayer and tetralayer nonlinear metasurfaces, which offer rich tunability in its effective nonlinear susceptibilities. Using gold-based metasurfaces, we demonstrate that a number of different singularities of nonlinear susceptibilities can exist in the parameter space of twist angle and interlayer gap between different twisted layers. At the singularities, reflected/transmitted light from the nonlinear process (such as second-harmonic generation) can either become circularly polarized (for C points), or entirely vanish (for V points). By further breaking symmetries of the system, we can independently tune all aspects of the reflected and transmitted nonlinear emission, achieving unidirectional emission with full-Poincar\u00e9 polarization tunability, a dark state (V-V point), or any other bidirectional output. Our work paves the way for multidimensional control of polarization and directionality in nonlinear light sources, opening new avenues in ultrafast optics, optical communication, sensing, and quantum optics.

The most coherent and intense waves resonantly interact with electrons nonlinearly, and the observable effects of such nonlinear interactions cannot be described within the frame of classical quasi-linear models. This paper provides an overview of the current stage of the theory of nonlinear resonant interactions and discusses different possible approaches for incorporating these nonlinear interactions into global radiation belt simulations.

    "abstract": "           Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a well-established technique widely used in fundamental research and diverse practical fields. Polarization-resolved LIBS, a variant of this technique, aims to improve the sensitivity, which is a critical aspect in numerous scientific domains. In our recent work we demonstrated that the degree of polarization (DOP) in the emission depends on the spatial location and time in a nano second laser generated aluminium plasma1. Present study investigates the effect of polarized emission on the estimation of plasma parameters. The plasma parameters are estimated using the conventional spectroscopic methods such as Boltzmann plot and line intensity ratio for the estimation of electron temperature and Stark broadening for estimating the electron density. The estimated plasma temperature using Boltzmann plot method shows large errors in electron temperature for the locations where DOP is higher. However, the electron density estimated using the Stark width does not show such variation. The observed ambiguity in temperature estimation using the Boltzmann plot method appears to be a consequence of deviation from expected Maxwell Boltzmann distribution of population of the involved energy levels. These findings highlight the need of assessing the DOP of the plasma before selecting the polarization for PRLIBS or temperature estimation using Boltzmann plots in elemental analysis.         ",

    "abstract": "           The invention of the laser unleashed the potential of optical metrology, leading to numerous advancements in modern science and technology. This reliance on lasers, however, also sets a bottleneck for precision optical metrology which is complicated by sophisticated photonic infrastructure required for delicate laser-wave control, leading to limited metrology performance and significant system complexity. Here we make a key step towards resolving this challenge, by demonstrating a Pockels laser with multi-functional capability that advances the optical metrology to a new level. The chip-scale laser exhibits a narrow intrinsic linewidth down to 167 Hz and a broad mode-hop-free tuning range up to 24 GHz. In particular, it offers an unprecedented frequency chirping rate up to 20 EHz/s, and an enormous modulation bandwidth >10 GHz, both orders of magnitude larger than any existing lasers. With this laser, we are able to successfully achieve velocimetry of 40 m/s at a short distance of 0.4 m, with a measurable velocity up to the first cosmic velocity at 1 m away, that is inaccessible by conventional ranging approaches, and distance metrology with a ranging resolution of <2 cm. Moreover, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we are able to realize a dramatically simplified architecture for laser frequency stabilization, by direct locking the laser to an external reference gas cell without any extra external light control. We successfully achieve a long-term laser stability with a frequency fluctuation of only $\\pm$ 6.5 MHz over 60 minutes. The demonstrated Pockels laser combines elegantly high laser coherence with ultrafast frequency reconfigurability and superior multifunctional capability that we envision to have profound impacts on many areas including communication, sensing, autonomous driving, quantum information processing, and beyond.

    "abstract": "           Multimodal imaging has shown great potential in cancer research by concurrently providing anatomical, functional, and molecular information in live, intact animals. During preclinical imaging of small animals like mice, anesthesia is required to prevent movement and improve image quality. However, their high surface area-to-body weight ratio predisposes mice, particularly nude mice, to hypothermia under anesthesia. To address this, we developed a detachable mouse scanning table with heating function for hybrid x-ray and optical imaging modalities, without introducing metal artifacts. Specifically, we employed Polylactic Acid (PLA) 3D printing technology to fabricate a customized scanning table, compatible with both CT and optical imaging systems. This innovation enables seamless transportation of the table between different imaging setups, while its detachable design facilitates maintaining a clutter-free operational environment within the imaging systems. This is crucial for accommodating various projects within the same scanner. The table features positioned fixation points to secure mice, ensuring positional consistency across imaging modalities. Additionally, we integrated a carbon nanotube-based heating pad into the table to regulate the body temperature of mice during examinations, providing an ethical and effective temperature maintenance solution. Our evaluations confirmed the table's ability to maintain a 30g water bag at approximately 40$^\\circ$C, effectively regulating mouse body temperature to an optimal 36$^\\circ$C during preclinical imaging sessions. This scanning table serves as a useful tool in preclinical cancer research, offering a versatile tool that upholds animal welfare standards.         ",

Notably, 100% modulation depth of the wave amplitude is achievable by simply varying the local orientation angle of meta-atom. We utilize the acoustic structure made of two cylindrical resonators to construct deep-subwavelength secondary source with designated initial phase delay, and HGPM supporting desired mode-conversion functionality is accordingly fabricated with four secondary sources. Both theory and experiment consistently verify the continuous amplitude modulation function of HGPM pair, which showcases a general scheme for reconfigurable amplitude-type acoustic meta-devices, i.e., those that require grayscale amplitude modulation for acoustic field engineering.

    "abstract": "           Reconstructing fields from sparsely observed data is an ill-posed problem that arises in many engineering and science applications. Here, we investigate the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct complete temperature, velocity and pressure fields from sparse and noisy experimental temperature data obtained through single-color laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The PINNs are applied to the laminar mixed convection system, a complex but fundamentally important phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of transient forced and natural convection behaviors. To enhance computation efficiency, this study also explores transfer learning (TL) as a mean of significantly reducing the time required for field reconstruction. Our findings demonstrate that PINNs are effective, capable of eliminating most experimental noise that does not conform to governing physics laws. Additionally, we show that the TL method achieves errors within 5% compared to the regular training scheme while reducing computation time by a factor of 9.9. We validate the PINN reconstruction results using non-simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and finite volume method (FVM) simulations. The reconstructed velocity fields from the PINN closely match those obtained from PIV. When using FVM data as a reference, the average temperature errors are below 1%, while the pressure and velocity errors are below 10%. This research provides insights into the feasibility of using PINNs for solving ill-posed problems with experimental data and highlights the potential of TL to enable near real-time field reconstruction.

This transition requires leveraging the inherent parallelism of wavelength and mode dimensions of light, complemented by high-order modulation formats, to significantly enhance data throughput. Here we experimentally demonstrate a novel synergy of these three dimensions, achieving multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second on-chip interconnects using ultra-broadband, multi-mode digital metamaterials. Employing a highly efficient edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method, we inversely design foundry-compatible, robust, and multi-port digital metamaterials with an 8xhigher computational efficiency. Using a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, we demonstrate a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels. A theoretical analysis suggests that further system optimization can enable on-chip interconnects to reach sub-petabit-per-second data transmission rates.

However, this architecture often results in high costs, significant hardware demands, and integration challenges. Here we propose a simplified radar architecture based on space-time-coding (STC) information metasurfaces. With their powerful capabilities to generate multiple harmonic frequencies and customize their phases, the STC metasurfaces play a key role in chirp signal generation, transmission, and echo reception. Remarkably, the receiving STC metasurface can implement dechirp processing directly on the RF level and realize the digital information outputs, which are beneficial to lower the hardware requirement at the receiving end while potentially shortening the time needed for conventional digital processing. As a proof of concept, the proposed metasurface radar is tested in a series of experiments for target detection and range/speed measurement, yielding results comparable to those obtained by conventional methods. This study provides valuable inspiration for a new radar system paradigm to combine the RF front ends and signal processors on the information metasurface platform that offers essential functionalities while significantly reducing the system complexity and cost.

Due to the critical order of the propagating vortex modes in waveguide, controlling the ITC of the AVF allows for the selective filtering of incoming multiplexed acoustic vortex beams based on the sound vortex diffraction in phase-gradient metasurface, which endows the vortex filter the capability that let the incident vortex of specific OAM pass through it. In the following demonstration, both in theory and experiment, we design the AVF and effectively filter the acoustic vortices with two opposite topological charges (TCs) by simply altering the orientation angle of the UAM. Based on this, we further demonstrate its application in asymmetric acoustic wave transmission. Our work offers an approach to selectively filter the incident acoustic vortex, which improves the capability to control the acoustic OAM via metasurfaces.         ",

While this has been proven in certain experiments, its main applications still reside in academic problems where the size of the system to be solved would not represent an obstacle to any modern desktop computer. Here we develop a systematic procedure to find the global optima of the modularity function to discover community structure in complex networks solely relying on pure annealers rather than hybrid solutions. We bypass the one-hot encoding constraints by hierarchically and recursively encoding binary instances of the problem that can be solved without the need to guess the exact penalties for the Lagrange multipliers. We study the variability, and robustness of the annealer as a function of network size, directness of connections, topology, and the resolution of the communities. We show how our approach produces meaningful and at least equally optimal solutions to state-of-the-art community detection algorithms while maintaining tractable computing times. Lastly, due to its recursive nature, the annealing process returns intermediate subdivisions thus offering interpretable rather than black-box solutions. These \\textit{dendrograms} can be used to unveil normal and pathological hidden hierarchies in brain networks hence opening the door to clinical workflows. Overall, this represents a first step towards an applicable practice-oriented usage of pure quantum annealing potentially bridging two segregated communities in modern science and engineering; that of network science and quantum computing.

    "abstract": "           In this work, we report an innovative pump-probe based experimental set up, to study the melting, subsequent evaporation, plasma formation and redeposition in a thin film coated on a glass substrate under different ambient conditions and laser fluences. The ambient conditions restrict the expansion of the plasma plume. At high ambient pressure, plume expansion stops closer to the substrate and get re-deposited at the site of the ablation. This helps in the identification of multiple processes and their temporal evolutions during the melting, expansion and re-deposition stages. The ambient conditions affect the plasma plume formed upon ablation, thus modulating the transmission of probe laser pulses, which provides information about the plume dynamics. Further, the study offers valuable insights into the laser-based ablation of thin film coatings, which will have implications in in situ cleaning of view ports on large experimental facilities such as tokamaks and other systems e.g. coating units, pulsed laser deposition, Laser induced forward transfer, Laser surface structuring, etc.         ",

Using the reconstruction equivalent-chirp technique, we designed linearly chirped 4PS Bragg gratings with two {\\pi}-phase shifts ({\\pi}-PS) positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the grating cavity, introducing two passbands in the +1st order channel. Leveraging the significant thermo-optic effect of silicon, dual-band tuning is achieved through integrated micro-heaters (MHs) on the chip surface. By varying the injection currents from 0 to 85 mA into the MHs, the device demonstrates continuous and wide-range optical frequency division (OFD) performance, with the frequency interval between the two passbands adjustable from 52.1 GHz to 439.5 GHz. Four notable frequency division setups at 100 GHz, 200 GHz, 300 GHz, and 400 GHz were demonstrated using a 100 GHz, 1535 nm semiconductor passive mode-locked laser as the light source.         ",

By judiciously designing the photonic structures that control the two-point Green's functions of the electromagnetic environment, the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (luminescence) and their interactions (e.g., F\u00f6rster energy transfer) can be conveniently tuned. In this paper, we designed a matched nanoparticle-on-mirror antenna pair with enhanced DDI guided by surface plasmon polaritons confined to the metal substrate, which ensures concentrated and enhanced interaction over long ranges of tens of wavelengths. The long-range ($\\sim 10 \\lambda$) DDI between donor-acceptor emitters is enhanced by $6\\times 10^{3}$ times respective to bare gold film, and $4.4\\times 10^{4}$ times respective to vacuum.

Here we demonstrate through particle-in-cell simulations a non-resonant field enhancement in hollow cores of ionized nanotubes. Surface plasmon polariton is excited in ionized nanotubes by the laser pulse, producing a back-scattered longitudinal field. This field interferes with the incoming field, and the phase shift of two fields induces an axial converging energy flow. The resulting concentrated energy is coupled into the waveguide formed by the tubular plasma and propagates with a reasonable loss. The field enhancement is sensitive to the inner radius and survives for a range of plasma densities. This enhanced field is almost homogeneous in a nanometer-sized volume and may facilitate high-field measurement with subwavelength spatial resolution.         ",

If this connection can be made accurately enough, it would become possible to determine a particles shape solely from its measured optical cross sections. For that, electromagnetic simulations can be used to bridge the morphology and optical properties assuming that they can be performed in an accurate manner. In this paper, we study key factors that influence the accuracy of electromagnetic simulations. First, we compare several standard electromagnetic simulation methods and discuss in detail the effects of the meshing accuracy, choice of dielectric function and inclusion of a substrate for the boundary element method. To help the boundary element methods complex parametrization, we develop a workflow including reconstruction, meshing and mesh simplification steps to be able to use electron tomography data as input for these simulations. In particular, we analyze how the choice of reconstruction algorithm and the intricacies of image segmentation influence the simulated optical cross sections and correlate it to induced shape errors, which can be minimized in the data processing pipeline. In our case, optimal results could be obtained by using the Total Variation Minimization (TVM) reconstruction method in combination with Otsu thresholding and slight smoothing, which was important to create a reliable and watertight surface mesh using the marching cubes algorithm, especially for more complex shapes.

We propose the emergence of power-law distributions as a generic feature of quantum systems with strong nonlinear dissipation. We introduce a prototypical family of quantum dynamical systems with nonlinear dissipation, and prove analytically the emergence of power-law tails in the steady state probability distribution for energy. The power law physically originates from the amplification of quantum noise, where the scale of the microscopic fluctuations grows with the energy of the system. Our model predicts a power-law regime with infinite mean energy, which manifests as extreme events and divergences in the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of power-law distributions for a general class of nonlinear dynamics known as quantum Li\u00e9nard systems.

Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom.

We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the spatial symmetry of the laser-field trajectory. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zero-th order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift or injection current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser.

We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.         ",

We propose to close this knowledge gap by using the real structure of a manufactured crystal as input in computations to obtain a realistic comparison with observations on the same nanostructure. We demonstrate this approach on the structure of a real silicon inverse woodpile photonic bandgap crystal, obtained by previous synchrotron X-ray imaging. A 2D part of the dataset is selected and processed into a computational mesh suitable for a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) to compute optical transmission spectra that are compared to those of a utopian crystal, i.e., a hypothetical model crystal with the same filling fraction where all pores are identical and circular. The nanopore shapes in the real crystal differ in a complex way from utopian pores, leading to a complex transmission spectrum with significant frequency speckle in and beyond the gap. The utopian model provides only a limited understanding of the spectrum: while it accurately predicts low frequency finite-size fringes and the lower band edge, the upper band edge is off, it completely misses the presence of speckle, the domination of speckle above the gap, and possible Anderson localized states in the gap. Moreover, unlike experiments where only external probes are available, numerical methods allow to study all fields everywhere. While the pore shapes hardly affect the fields at low frequency, major differences occur at high frequency such as localized fields deep inside the real crystal. In summary, using only external measurements and utopian models may give an erroneous picture of the fields and the LDOS inside a real crystal, which is remedied by our new approach.         ",

    "abstract": "           This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct multiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on instantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection problems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of fields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors are observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits relatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that reconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing solution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields. Furthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions where the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations often manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based reconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale variations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To mitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a multi-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and reformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum and mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights into the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with large solution space and field variations across multiple scales.         ",

    "abstract": "           With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.         ",
