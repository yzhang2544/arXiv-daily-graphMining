    "title": "On Resonance Enhancement of $E1-E2$ Nondipole Photoelectron Asymmetries in Low-Energy Ne $2p$-Photoionization",
    "abstract": "           Earlier, a significant enhancement of the nondipole parameters $\\gamma_{2p}$, $\\delta_{2p}$, and $\\zeta_{2p} = \\gamma_{2p} + 3\\delta_{2p}$ in the photoelectron angular distribution for Ne $2p$ photoionization, owing to resonance interference between dipole ($E1$) and quadrupole ($E2$) transitions, was predicted. This enhancement manifests as narrow resonance spikes in the parameters due to the low-energy $2s \\rightarrow 3p$ and $2s \\rightarrow 4p$ dipole, as well as the $2s \\rightarrow 3d$ quadrupole autoionizing resonances. Given the unique nature of this predicted enhancement, it requires further validation. Specifically, whether these narrow spikes in $\\gamma_{2p}$, $\\delta_{2p}$, and $\\zeta_{2p}$ will or will not retain their values for experimental observation if one accounts for a typical finite frequency spread in the ionizing radiation. To address this, we revisit the previous study, now incorporating the effect of frequency spread in the ionizing radiation, assuming a spread as large as $5$ meV at the half-maximum of the radiation's intensity. We demonstrate in the present paper that while the frequency spread does affect the resonance enhancement of $\\gamma_{2p}$, $\\delta_{2p}$, and $\\zeta_{2p}$, these parameters still retain quantitatively significant values to be observed experimentally. The corresponding calculations were performed using the random phase approximation with exchange, which accounts for interchannel coupling in both dipole and quadrupole photoionization amplitudes.

    "abstract": "           We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.         ",

    "title": "Theoretical Insights into 1:2 and 1:3 Internal Resonance for Frequency Stabilization in Nonlinear Micromechanical Resonators",
    "abstract": "           Micromechanical resonators are essential components in time-keeping and sensing devices due to their high frequency, high quality factor, and sensitivity. However, their extremely low damping can lead to various nonlinear phenomena that can compromise frequency stability. A major limiting factor is the Duffing hardening effect, which causes frequency drift through amplitude variations, known as the amplitude-frequency effect. Recently, internal resonance (InRes) has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate this issue and enhance frequency stabilization. In this study, we investigate the frequency stabilization mechanisms of 1:2 and 1:3 InRes using a generalized two-mode reduced-order model that includes Duffing nonlinearity and nonlinear modal coupling. By analyzing the frequency response curves and pi/2-backbone curves, we demonstrate how different parameters affect the effectiveness of frequency stabilization. Our results identify two distinct regimes depending on the coupling strength relative to the stiffening effect as a key factor in determining the stabilization mechanism. For the regime of weak coupling, both 1:2 and 1:3 InRes achieve frequency stabilization through amplitude and frequency saturation over a range of forcing amplitudes. In contrast, strong coupling reduces the amplitude-frequency effect by forming an asymptote line for 1:2 InRes or a zero-dispersion point for 1:3 InRes. These insights offer valuable guidelines for designing micromechanical resonators with high-frequency stability, highlighting InRes as a robust tool for enhancing performance in practical applications.

Leveraging the capabilities of Polyjet 3D printing techniques, we have developed a cost-effective method for fabricating liquid geometric waveguide combiners for AR applications, using silicone oil as the medium. During the design phase, we optimized the structure of the waveguide combiner to facilitate easier fabrication. Our proposed method simplifies the production process by removing the need for complicated steps like dicing, layer bonding, and polishing, which are usually involved in traditional manufacturing techniques. We conducted optical simulations and developed a prototype using our patented fabrication method, which successfully demonstrated the integration of virtual images with the real-world environment, thereby confirming its feasibility and potential for cost-effective mass production.

    "abstract": "           We investigated the influence of sub-cycle driving fields on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), with a focus on intrinsic chirp, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and number of laser cycles. Our findings reveals that the center frequency of a laser pulse scales as $\\tau^{-5/4}$ with pulse duration $\\tau$, and that attochirp exhibits a similar dependence on pulse duration. Additionally, we identified CEP-specific trends in harmonic yield: it increases as $\\tau^{5/4}$ for $\\phi_0=0^\\circ$ and decreases as $\\tau^{-4.1}$ for $\\phi_0= -90^\\circ$. Although sub-cycle pulses can generate intense isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs), they also tend to produce higher attochirp and reduced cutoff energies. However, effective compensation for attochirp can mitigate these drawbacks, thereby increasing the capability of sub-cycle pulses to generate short-duration, high-intensity IAPs. These results offer valuable insights into HHG using sub-cycle pulses and have important implications for the advancement of ultrafast light sources and the understanding of ultrafast phenomena at the attosecond timescale.

Additionally, we determine the center of gravity of the P(63) transition of the 4-4 vibrational band, resulting in a 250-fold improvement in the precision of its position. We also note an interesting overlap of the hyperfine transitions of P(63)4-4 line with the UV 1S0-3P1 narrow intercombination transition of cadmium atoms, which occurs near the second harmonic of the master laser radiation, corresponding to 326.2 nm. This study contributes to updating the iodine atlas, improving the precision of the empirical formulae, and providing an important frequency reference for precision spectroscopy of the narrow intercombination transition of atomic cadmium.

However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.         ",

    "abstract": "           Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.

The known trajectory and timing of this return provided a rare opportunity to strategically instrument sites to record geophysical signals produced by the capsule as it traveled at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere. We deployed two optical-fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogators to sample over 12 km of surface-draped, fiber-optic cables along with six co-located seismometer-infrasound sensor pairs, spread across two sites near Eureka, NV. This campaign-style rapid deployment is the first reported recording of a sample return capsule entry with any distributed fiber optic sensing technology. The DAS interrogators recorded an impulsive arrival with an extended coda which had features that were similar to recordings from both the seismometers and infrasound sensors. While the signal-to-noise of the DAS data was lower than the seismic-infrasound data, the extremely dense spacing of fiber-optic sensors allowed for more phases to be clearly distinguished and the continuous transformation of the wavefront as it impacted the ground could be visualized. Unexpectedly, the DAS recordings contain less low-frequency content than is present in both the seismic and infrasound data. The deployment conditions strongly affected the recorded DAS data, in particular, we observed that fiber selection and placement exert strong controls on data quality.         ",

By means of dedicated models, we highlight that the correction factor {\\alpha} frequently used to relate the Hall voltage to the magnetic field averaged over the sensor area can be greatly improved in the high proximity situation enabled by the use of graphene, particularly in the ballistic regime. In addition, it is demonstrated that by fine-tuning the dipole position in the sensor plane, the Hall response becomes highly selective with respect to the dipole orientation. These analyses show that diffusive graphene Hall sensors may be preferred for particle detection, while ballistic ones used as close as possible to a nanomagnet would be preferred for magnetometry. With the support of micromagnetic simulations, the principle of the magnetic hysteresis loop measurement of an isolated nanomagnet is quantitively demonstrated with large signal-to-noise ratio to probe incoherent magnetization reversal. Devices based on specially designed graphene Hall crosses operating in the ballistic regime promise to outperform state-of-the-art ballistic Hall sensors based on semiconductor quantum wells especially for nano-magnetometry.
