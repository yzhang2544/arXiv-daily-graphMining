    "title": "Ring structural transitions in strongly coupled dusty plasmas",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical study of ring structural transitions in strongly coupled dusty plasma confined in a ring-shaped (quartic) potential well with a central barrier, whose axis of symmetry is parallel to the gravitational attraction. It is observed that increasing the amplitude of the potential leads to a transition from a ring monolayer structure (rings of different diameters nested within the same plane) to a cylindrical shell structure (rings of similar diameter aligned in parallel planes). In the cylindrical shell state, the rings alignment in the vertical plane exhibits hexagonal symmetry. The ring transition is reversible, but exhibits hysteresis in the initial and final particle positions. As the critical conditions for the transitions are approached, the transitional structure states exhibit zigzag instabilities or asymmetries on the ring alignment. Furthermore, for a fixed amplitude of the quartic potential that results in a cylinder-shaped shell structure, we show that additional rings in the cylindrical shell structure can be formed by decreasing the curvature of the parabolic potential well, whose axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the gravitational force, increasing the number density, and lowering the screening parameter. Finally, we discuss the application of these findings to dusty plasma experiments with ring electrodes and weak magnetic fields. ",

    "abstract": "Surface potential in a topological matter could unprecedentedly localize the waves. However, this surface potential is yet to be exploited in topological photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate that photonic surface states can be induced and controlled by the surface potential in a dielectric double gyroid (DG) photonic crystal. The basis translation in a unit cell enables tuning of the surface potential, which in turn regulates the degree of wave localization. The gradual modulation of DG photonic crystals enables the generation of a pseudomagnetic field. Overall, this study shows the interplay between surface potential and pseudomagnetic field regarding the surface states. The physical consequences outlined herein not only widen the scope of surface states in 3D photonic crystals but also highlight the importance of surface treatments in a photonic system. ",

This paper reviews the applications of optical microcombs. First, an overview of the devices and methods for generating optical microcombs is provided, which are categorized into material platforms, device architectures, soliton classes, and driving mechanisms. Second, the broad applications of optical microcombs are systematically reviewed, which are categorized into microwave photonics, optical communications, precision measurements, neuromorphic computing, and quantum optics.

    "abstract": "Thermal tuning of the optical refractive index in the waveguides to control light phase accumulation is essential in photonic integrated systems and applications. In silicon photonics, microheaters are mainly realized by metal wires or highly doped silicon lines placed at a safe distance (1um) from the waveguide to avoid considerable optical loss. However, this poses a significant limitation for heating efficiency because of the excessive free-carrier loss when a heater is brought closer to the optical path. In this work, we present a new concept of using optically transparent 2D semiconductors (e.g. MoS2) for realizing highly efficient waveguide integrated heaters operating at telecom wavelengths. We demonstrate that a single-layer MoS2 heater with negligible optical absorption in the infrared can be placed in close proximity (only 30nm) to the waveguide and show the best-reported heating efficiency of 15 mW per FSR without sacrificing the optical insertion loss. The heater response time is 25us, limited by Au 1L-MoS2 Schottky contact. Both the efficiency and response time can be further significantly improved by realizing 2D MoS2 heaters with ohmic contacts. Our work shows clear advantages of employing 2D semiconductors for heaters applications and paves the way for developing novel energy-efficient, lossless 2D heaters for on-chip photonic integrated circuits.

This structure generates optical phenomena such as structural colors and birefringence that produce a metalic or iridescent appearance, polarization upon reflection and optical activity. We model the anisotropic optical responses of the cuticle of arthropods using the Photonic package to obtain the macroscopic dielectric tensor of a constitutive layer in the Bouligand helix. We find that its anisotropy depends on the shape of the chitin particles, their reticular arrangement and their filling fractions. As a main result, we obtained a cuticle model with tunable reflectance band gaps that are very sensitive to geometrical parameters such as the angle $\\theta$ that controls the helix pitch. We can explain the structural colors in terms of the reflectance band gap induced by the modulation of the anisotropy mediated by $\\theta$, instead of following the usual approach that consider multiple arrangement of layers pairs with different thickness and optical properties.

Here, we propose a method that makes the deterministic use of multiple scattering for microscopic imaging of an object embedded deep within scattering media. The proposed method finds a stack of multiple complex phase plates that generate similar light trajectories as the original scattering medium. By implementing the inverse scattering using the identified phase plates, our method rectifies multiple scattering and amplifies ballistic waves by almost 600 times, which leads to a substantial increase in imaging depth. Our study marks an important milestone in solving the longstanding high-order inverse scattering problems. ",

    "abstract": "The time-of-flight method is a fundamental approach for characterizing the transport properties of semiconductors. Recently, the transient photocurrent and optical absorption kinetics have been simultaneously measured for thin films; pulsed-light excitation of thin films should give rise to non-negligible in-depth carrier injection. Yet, the effects of in-depth carrier injection on the transient currents and optical absorption have not yet been elucidated theoretically. Here, by considering the in-depth carrier injection in simulations, we found a 1/t^{1-alpha/2} initial time (t) dependence rather than the conventional $1/t^{1-alpha}$ dependence under a weak external electric field, where alpha<1 is the index of dispersive diffusion.The asymptotic transient currents are not influenced by the initial in-depth carrier injection and follow the conventional 1/t^{1+alpha} time dependence. We also present the relation between the field-dependent mobility coefficient and the diffusion coefficient when the transport is dispersive. The field dependence of the transport coefficients influences the transit time in the photocurrent kinetics dividing two power-law decay regimes. The classical Scher--Montroll theory predicts a_1+a_2=2 when the initial photocurrent decay is given by 1/t^{a_1} and the asymptotic photocurrent decay is given by 1/t^{a_2}. The results shed light on the interpretation of the power-law exponent of 1/t^{a_1} when a_1+a_2neq 2. ",

The introduction of spatial non-uniformity by separated gate sections creates regions with distinct carrier concentrations and velocities, giving rise to harmonic behaviors. The resulting frequency spectrum of DC voltage response is composed of enhanced and suppressed regions. In the enhanced region, the amplitude of response voltage can be enlarged up to 100% compared to that in a uniform channel device. The distribution pattern of those regions is directly related to the number of gate sections (Ns).

We propose a framework for quantum computing of fluid dynamics based on the hydrodynamic Schr\\\"odinger equation (HSE), which can be promising in simulating three-dimensional turbulent flows in various engineering applications. The HSE is derived by generalizing the Madelung transform to compressible/incompressible flows with finite vorticity and dissipation. Since the HSE is expressed as a unitary operator on a two-component wave function, it is more suitable than the NSE for quantum computing. The flow governed by the HSE can resemble a turbulent flow consisting of tangled vortex tubes with the five-thirds scaling of energy spectrum. We develop a prediction-correction quantum algorithm to solve the HSE. This algorithm is implemented for simple flows on the quantum simulator Qiskit with exponential speedup. ",

    "abstract": "Chiral excited electronic states of molecules have an intrinsic sense of handedness, or twist, and are the active component in energy efficient display technologies and in new photosynthetic routes to produce pharmaceuticals. Creating chiral states is achieved by manipulating the twistiness of the geometric molecular structure. This is a demanding problem adding complexity due to the need to precisely control molecular geometry. Here we demonstrate a novel concept for creating chiral excited states which does not rely on molecular structure. Instead, it depends on hybridising a non chiral molecule with a chiral electromagnetic field, producing a hybrid light matter chiral polariton state. This is achieved by a symmetry controlled strong chiral-light matter interaction between an electromagnetic mode of a chiral nanocavity and an achiral molecule, a concept referred to as the electromagnetic enantiomer. This electromagnetic mechanism simplifies the creation of chiral electronic states since it is far less demanding in terms of materials design. We have illustrated the concept using an exemplar system relevant to organic optoelectronic technology, producing efficient circularly polarised emission from a non-chiral emitter molecule. ",

Its band structure exhibits two Dirac points (DPs) that are separated by a nearly flat band. We present a procedure which we employed to identify eigenfrequencies and to separate the eigenstates according to their transformation properties under rotation by 60 degree into the three C3 subspaces. This allows us to verify previous numerical results of Ref. [W.Zhang and B. Dietz, Phys. Rev. B 104, 064310 (2021)], thus confirming that the properties of the eigenmodes coincide with those of artificial graphene around the lower DP, and are well described by a tight-binding model (TBM) for a honeycomb-kagome lattice of corresponding shape. Above all, we investigate properties of the wave-function components in terms of the fluctuation properties of the measured scattering matrix, which are numerically not accessible. They are compared to random-matrix theory predictions for quantum-chaotic scattering systems exhibiting extended or localized states in the interaction region, that is, the DB. Even in regions, where the wave functions are localized, the spectral properties coincide with those of typical quantum systems with chaotic classical counterpart. ",

This theory is based on the Harish-Chandra formalism, which describes the relativistic dynamics of a massless spin-1 boson, like a photon. Via this formalism, the Bohmian average transport velocity of the electromagnetic energy is formulated. It is proved that, if the dielectric making the waveguide is nonabsorptive and nondispersive, this velocity can be superluminal. This result is validated in the framework of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrating that the average velocity of the photon inside the waveguide is given by the contribution of instantaneous superluminal velocities. This theory, therefore, suggests the optimal conditions for designing optical devices capable of locally transporting electromagnetic energy at superluminal velocities mitigating the signal attenuation.

Predictions from the models indicate a strong decrease of P-fail with increasing correlation-strength, which is found to be in excellent agreement to results from Monte Carlo simulations. The dependency of P-fail on track-width and scan speed is investigated, confirming previous assumptions on the impact of correlations. Expressions and applicable constraints are derived for the limits of full and no correlations, and the optimal track width to minimize the acquisition time is computed for a range of scan speeds.
