    "abstract": "We demonstrate the formation of a single RbCs molecule during the merging of two optical tweezers, one containing a single Rb atom and the other a single Cs atom. Both atoms are initially predominantly in the motional ground states of their respective tweezers. We confirm molecule formation and establish the state of the molecule formed by measuring its binding energy. We find that the probability of molecule formation can be controlled by tuning the confinement of the traps during the merging process, in good agreement with coupled-channel calculations. We show that the conversion efficiency from atoms to molecules using this technique is comparable to magnetoassociation. ",

    "abstract": "Modern electron storage rings produce bright X-rays via spontaneous synchrotron emission, which is useful for a variety of scientific applications. The X-ray free-electron laser oscillator (XFELO) has the potential to amplify this output, both in terms of peak power and photon coherence. However, even current 4th generation storage rings (4GSRs) lack the requisite electron beam brightness to drive the XFELO due to its electron energy spread. The transverse gradient undulator (TGU) can overcome this issue, thus providing a practical means to couple the 4GSR to the XFELO. In this study, we first examine the theoretical basis of the TGU interaction by deriving the 3D TGU gain formula in the low gain approximation. Then, we perform an optimization study of the gain formula in order to determine optimal beam and machine parameters. Finally, we construct a hypothetical storage ring TGU-XFELO based on near-optimal parameters and report on its projected performance using multi-stage numerical simulation. We also discuss potential implementation challenges associated with the ring-FEL coupling. ",

It is based on the three-photon electromagnetically induced absorption (TPEIA) spectrum. In this process, the multi-photon produces a narrow absorption peak, which has a larger magnitude than the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) peak under the same conditions. The TPEIA peak is sensitive to MW fields, and can be used to measure MW electric field strength. It is interesting to find that the magnitude of TPEIA peaks shows a linear relationship with the MW field strength. The simulation results show that the minimum detectable strength of the MW fields is about 1/10 that based on an common EIT effect, and the probe sensitivity is improved by about 4 times. Furthermore, the MW sensing based on three-photon coherence shows a broad tunability, and the scheme may be useful for designing novel MW sensing devices. ",

The ability to determine the shape of a scatterer, either in the context of material design or sensing, plays a critical role in many practical engineering problems. This class of inverse problems is extremely challenging due to their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and ill-posed nature. To overcome these technical hurdles, we introduce a geometric regularization approach for deep neural networks (DNN) based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) and capable of predicting complex 2D scatterer geometries in a parsimonious dimensional representation. Then, this geometric regularization is combined with physics-embedded learning and integrated within a robust convolutional autoencoder (CAE) architecture to accurately predict the shape of 2D scatterers in the context of identification and inverse design problems. An extensive numerical study is presented in order to showcase the remarkable ability of this approach to handle complex scatterer geometries while generating physically-consistent acoustic fields. The study also assesses and contrasts the role played by the (weakly) embedded physics in the convergence of the DNN predictions to a physically consistent inverse design. ",

    "abstract": "Porous acoustic absorbers have excellent properties in the low-frequency range when positioned in room edges, therefore they are a common method for reducing low-frequency reverberation. However, standard room acoustic simulation methods such as ray tracing and mirror sources are invalid for low frequencies in general which is a consequence of using geometrical methods, yielding a lack of simulation tools for these so-called edge absorbers. In this article, a validated finite element simulation model is presented, which is able to predict the effect of an edge absorber on the acoustic field. With this model, the interaction mechanisms between room and absorber can be studied by high-resolved acoustic field visualizations in both room and absorber. The finite element model is validated against transfer function data computed from impulse response measurements in a reverberation chamber in style of ISO 354. The absorber made of Basotect is modeled using the Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge model, which is fitted to impedance tube measurements using the four-microphone transfer matrix method. It is shown that the finite element simulation model is able to predict the influence of different edge absorber configurations on the measured transfer functions to a high degree of accuracy. The evaluated third-octave band error exhibits deviations of 3.25dB to 4.11dB computed from third-octave band averaged spectra. ",

Unlike the more common spatial cloaks the goal of which is hiding fixed objects from detection, the goal of the temporal cloak is hiding the occurrence of events during a finite period of time. In electromagnetic systems, in which events represent, for example, leakage of signals from transmission lines or optical fibers, temporal cloaking solutions usually rely on nonlinear phenomena related to the fibers properties, or on modulating the properties of the propagation medium itself. In particular, the transformation-based solution requires modulating the constitutive parameters of the medium both in space and time. Our control approach is fully linear, where the required change in the medium parameters is programmed into the controllers and created by external actuators in real-time. This cloaking system keeps the physical medium unchanged, and enables to reprogram the cloaking parameters upon request. We demonstrate our solution in a simulation of a one-dimensional water channel. ",

By mapping our calculation of the second-order energy correction to an evolution in imaginary time using the diffusion Monte Carlo method, we are able to calculate these corrections for the first time. After benchmarking our method in the few-body sector, we explore the effect of charge-independence breaking terms in the nuclear Hamiltonian. We then employ the new approach to investigate the many-body, perturbative, order-by-order convergence that is fundamental in modern theories of the nucleon-nucleon interaction derived from chiral effective field theory.

The THz emission from the AHE-based CoFeB emitter is optimized by varying its thickness, orientation, and pump fluence of the laser beam.

By tuning the particle-particle interaction and rotation speed, the preference of the formation of the center-of-mass state, vortex state, and off-centered vortex state can be distinguished on the phase diagram.

    "abstract": "Axions detection requires the ultimate sensitivity down to the single photon limit. In the microwave region this corresponds to energies in the yJ range. This extreme sensitivity has to be combined with an extremely low dark count rate, since the probability of axions conversion into microwave photons is supposed to be very low. To face this complicated task, we followed two promising approaches that both rely on the use of superconducting devices based on the Josephson effect. The first one is to use a single Josephson junction (JJ) as a switching detector (i.e. exploiting the superconducting to normal state transition in presence of microwave photons). We designed a device composed of a coplanar waveguide terminated on a current biased Josephson junction. We tested its efficiency to pulsed (pulse duration 10 ns) microwave signals, since this configuration is closer to an actual axions search experiment. We show how our device is able to reach detection capability of the order of 10 photons with frequency 8 GHz. The second approach is based on an intrinsically quantum device formed by two resonators coupled only via a superconducting qubit network (SQN). This approach relies on quantum nondemolition measurements of the resonator photons. We show that injecting RF power into the resonator, the frequency position of the resonant drop in the transmission coefficient (S21) can be modulated up to 4 MHz. We anticipate that, once optimized, both the devices have the potential to reach single photon sensitivity. ",

Notable examples include a 2D and 3D quantum ``compass'' and a 2D sensor that provides a scalable improvement over unentangled sensors. Our results on optimal and variational multi-parameter quantum metrology are useful for advancing precision measurements in fundamental science and ensuring the stability of quantum computers, which can be achieved through the incorporation of optimal quantum sensors in a quantum feedback loop.

    "abstract": "Nuclear quantum phenomena beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation are known to play an important role in a growing number of chemical and biological processes. While there exists no unique consensus on a rigorous and efficient implementation of coupled electron-nuclear quantum dynamics, it is recognised that these problems scale exponentially with system size on classical processors and therefore may benefit from quantum computing implementations. Here, we introduce a methodology for the efficient quantum treatment of the electron-nuclear problem on near-term quantum computers, based upon the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital (NEO) approach. We generalize the electronic two-qubit tapering scheme to include nuclei by exploiting symmetries inherent in the NEO framework; thereby reducing the hamiltonian dimension, number of qubits, gates, and measurements needed for calculations. We also develop parameter transfer and initialisation techniques, which improve convergence behavior relative to conventional initialisation. These techniques are applied to H$_2$ and malonaldehyde for which results agree with Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Full Configuration Interaction and Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction benchmarks for ground state energy to within $10^{-6}$ Ha and entanglement entropy to within $10^{-4}$. These implementations therefore significantly reduce resource requirements for full quantum simulations of molecules on near-term quantum devices while maintaining high accuracy. ",
