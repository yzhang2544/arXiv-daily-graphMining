    "abstract": "Wireless communication through dynamic spectrum allocation over microwave bands, essential to accommodate exponentially growing data traffic, requires massive array of radio-frequency (RF) filters for adaptive signal shaping at arbitrary frequencies. However, conventional RF filters based on planar acoustic resonators are incapable to realize such massive integrated arrays, due to their large footprint and limited on-chip frequency scalability. Here, we present a signal processor enabled by integration of three-dimensional ferroelectric-gate fin (FGF) nano-acoustic resonators with extreme frequency tailorability and large-scale integrability. FGFs are created by growing atomic-layered ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia transducers on silicon nano-fins, operate in bulk acoustic modes with lithographically scalable frequency over 3-28 GHz, and provide record high frequency - quality factor - electromechanical coupling product (f.Q.kt2) of 19.4 x 1010 (at ~11GHz). A monolithic filter-array covering 9-12 GHz is also demonstrated by on-chip electrical coupling of FGFs. This demonstration highlights the potential of FGF resonators to realize chip-scale adaptive processors extendable to millimeter-wave frequencies. ",

In particular, we generalize an unsupervised learning algorithm to find the particles' eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. During training, the neural network adjusts its weights and biases, one of which is the energy eigenvalue, so its output approximately solves the Schr\\\"odinger equation with normalized and mutually orthogonal eigenfunctions.

Recently, quantum holography has been realized by utilizing polarization entangled state with the advantages of high robustness and enhanced spatial resolution, comparing with classical one. However, the polarization is only a two-dimensional degree of freedom, which greatly limits the capacity of quantum holography. Here, we propose a method to realize high-dimensional quantum holography by using high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. A high capacity OAM-encoded quantum holographic system can be obtained by multiplexing a wide range of OAM-dependent holographic images. Proof-of-principle experiments with four- and six-dimensional OAM entangled states have been implemented and verify the feasibility of our idea. Our experimental results also demonstrate that the high-dimensional quantum holography shows a high robustness to classical noise. Furthermore, OAMselective holographic scheme for quantum encryption is proposed and demonstrated. Comparing with the previous schemes, the level of security of holographic imaging encryption system can be greatly improved in our high-dimensional quantum holography. ",

However, these traditional approaches are significantly limited by cost, weight, and heating due to their relatively low efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach by using a metasurface to achieve free-positioning and multi-user compatibility. The metasurface works as a passive device to reform the magnetic field and enables high-efficiency free-positioning wireless power transfer with only a single transmitting coil. It shows up to 4.6 times improvement in efficiency. The metasurface also increases the coverage area from around 5 cm by 5 cm with over 40% efficiency to around 10 cm by 10 cm with over 70% efficiency. We further show that the system can support multiple receivers. Besides increasing the overall efficiency, we demonstrate tuning the power division between the multiple receivers, enabling compensation of receivers of different sizes to achieve their desired power.

This study provides the results of three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations exhibiting the possibility of the anapole state in high refractive index dielectric nanohole array metasurfaces having different profiles of the holes (square, hexagon and octagon). Behavior of the effective optical Kerr nonlinearity of the metasurfaces in the vicinity of the anapole state is investigated. Depending on the geometry, the absolute value of the effective nonlinear Kerr coefficient of the metasurface may be up to three orders of magnitude greater than that of the unstructured film. A square transverse section of the nanohole is preferable for the optical Kerr effect in the holey metasurfaces. The effect of the random rotation of the square holes representing the metasurface irregularity on the optical nonlinearity is examined. ",

For imaging systems obeying paraxial shift-invariance, a small shift in input angle causes a corresponding shift in the sensor image. Shift-invariance has deep implications for the design and functionality of optical devices, such as the necessity of free space between components (as in compound objectives made of several curved surfaces). We present a method for nanophotonic inverse design of compact imaging systems whose resolution is not constrained by paraxial shift-invariance. Our method is end-to-end, in that it integrates density-based full-Maxwell topology optimization with a fully iterative elastic-net reconstruction algorithm. By the design of nanophotonic structures that scatter light in a non-shift-invariant manner, our optimized nanophotonic imaging system overcomes the limitations of paraxial shift-invariance, achieving accurate, noise-robust image reconstruction beyond shift-invariant resolution.

Here we theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate a class of graphene edges, namely, the twig-shaped edges, using a photonic platform, thereby observing edge states distinctive from those observed before. Our main findings are: (i) the twig edge is a generic type of HCL edges complementary to the armchair edge, formed by choosing the right primitive cell rather than simple lattice cutting or Klein edge modification; (ii) the twig edge states form a complete flat band across the Brillouin zone with zero-energy degeneracy, characterized by nontrivial topological winding of the lattice Hamiltonian; (iii) the twig edge states can be elongated or compactly localized along the boundary, manifesting both flat band and topological features. Such new edge states are realized in a laser-written photonic graphene and well corroborated by numerical simulations. Our results may broaden the understanding of graphene edge states, bringing about new possibilities for wave localization in artificial Dirac-like materials. ",

Previous studies have theoretically shown that thermal emission of LSPhs results in narrow-band peaks in the near-field spectra, whose spectral locations can be modulated by changing the dimensions of the nanostructure. However, near-field thermal emission of LSPhs has not been experimentally explored yet. In this study, we measure the spectrum of near-field thermal radiation from arrays of 6H-silicon carbide (6H-SiC) nanopillars using an internal-reflection-element based spectroscopy technique. We present an experimental demonstration of thermal emission of the transverse dipole, quadrupole, and octupole, as well as longitudinal monopole from 6H-SiC nanopillars at a near-field distance from the array. We show that the spectral location of the longitudinal monopole and transverse dipole are significantly affected by the near-field coupling between neighboring nanopillars as well as the intercoupling of the nanopillars and the substrate. We also experimentally demonstrate that the spectrum of near-field thermal radiation from 6H-SiC nanopillar arrays can be tuned by varying the dimensions of the nanopillars, providing an opportunity for designing emitters with tailored near-field thermal radiation.

    "abstract": "Recent ab-initio studies of electron transport in GaAs have reported that electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions beyond the lowest order play a fundamental role in charge transport and noise phenomena. Inclusion of the next-leading-order process in which an electron scatters with two phonons was found to yield good agreement for the high-field drift velocity, but the characteristic non-monotonic trend of the power spectral density of current fluctuations (PSD) with electric field was not predicted. The high computational cost of the ab-initio approach necessitated various approximations to the two-phonon scattering term, which were suggested as possible origins of the discrepancy. Here, we report a semi-analytical transport model of two-phonon electron scattering via the Fr\\\"ohlich mechanism, allowing a number of the approximations in the ab-initio treatment to be lifted while retaining the accuracy to within a few percent. We compare the calculated and experimental transport and noise properties as well as scattering rates measured by photoluminescence experiments. We find quantitative agreement within 15% for the drift velocity and 25% for the $\\Gamma$ valley scattering rates, and agreement with the $\\Gamma-L$ intervalley scattering rates within a factor of two. Considering these results and prior studies of current noise in GaAs, we conclude that the most probable origin of the non-monotonic PSD trend versus electric field is the formation of space charge domains rather than intervalley scattering as has been assumed.

Despite the tremendous progress in hybrid integrations of III-V quantum emitters with silicon-based photonic circuits and superconducting single-photon detectors, on-chip optical excitations of quantum emitters via miniaturized lasers towards single-photon sources (SPSs) with low power consumptions, small device footprints and excellent coherence properties is highly desirable yet illusive. In this work, we present realizations of bright semiconductor singe-photon sources heterogeneously integrated with on-chip electrically-injected microlasers. Different from previous one-by-one transfer printing technique implemented in hybrid quantum dot (QD) photonic devices, multiple deterministically coupled QD-circular Bragg Grating (CBG) SPSs were integrated with electrically-injected micropillar lasers at one time via a potentially scalable transfer printing process assisted by the wide-field photoluminescence (PL) imaging technique. Optically pumped by electrically-injected microlasers, pure single photons are generated with a high-brightness of a count rate of 3.8 M/s and an extraction efficiency of 25.44%. Such a high-brightness is due to the enhancement by the cavity mode of the CBG, which is confirmed by a Purcell factor of 2.5. Our work provides a powerful tool for advancing hybrid integrated quantum photonics in general and boosts the developments for realizing highly-compact, energy-efficient and coherent SPSs in particular.

    "abstract": "A recent work [PRL, 126, 208002 (2021)] has explored how thermal noise-induced randomness in a self-assembled photonic crystal affects photonic band gaps (PBGs). For the system of a two-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a self-assembled array of rods with square cross sections, it was found that its PBGs can exist over an extensive range of packing densities. Counterintuitively, at intermediate packing densities, the transverse magnetic (TM) band gap of the self-assembled system can be larger than that of its corresponding perfect system (rods arranged in a perfect square lattice and having identical orientations). Due to shape anisotropicity, the randomness in the self-assembled system contains two kinds of randomness, i.e., positional and orientational randomness of the particles. In this work, we further investigate how PBGs are influenced solely by positional or orientational randomness. We find that compared to the perfect situation, the introduction of only orientational randomness decreases the transverse electric (TE) band gap while having no obvious effects on the transverse magnetic (TM) band gap. In contrast, the introduction of only positional randomness decreases the TE band gap significantly, while it can widen or narrow the TM band gap, depending on the parameter range. We also discuss the thermal (i.e., self-assembled) system where two kinds of randomness are present. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the role orientational randomness and positional randomness play on PBGs, and may benefit the PBG engineering of photonic crystals through self-assembly approaches.
