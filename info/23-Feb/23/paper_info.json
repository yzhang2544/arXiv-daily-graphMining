    "abstract": "Wavefield travel time tomography is used for a variety of purposes in acoustics, geophysics and non-destructive testing. Since the problem is non-linear, assessing uncertainty in the results requires many forward evaluations. It is therefore important that the forward evaluation of travel times and ray paths is efficient, which is challenging in anisotropic media. Given a computed travel time field, ray tracing can be performed to obtain the fastest ray path from any point in the medium to the source of the travel time field. These rays can then be used to speed up gradient based inversion methods. We present a forward modeller for calculating travel time fields by localised estimation of wavefronts, and a novel approach to ray tracing through travel time fields. These methods have been tested in a complex anisotropic weld and give travel times comparable to those obtained using finite element modelling while being computationally cheaper. ",

The experiments have been carried out in a frequency range encompassing three orders of magnitude, from 10 kHz to 10 MHz, versus temperature. The relaxation data have been thoroughly analyzed in terms of several relaxation models with the purpose to reveal the mechanisms of water motion. For this purpose four relaxation models have been used: the data have been decomposed into relaxation contributions expressed in terms of Lorentzian spectral densities, then three dimensional translation diffusion has been assumed, next two dimensional surface diffusion has been considered and eventually, a model of surface diffusion mediated by acts of adsorption to the surface has been employed. In this way it has been demonstrated that the last concept is most plausible. Parameters describing the dynamics in a quantita-tive manner have been determined and discussed. ",

We present three practical, scalable, verifiable (k, n) threshold QSS protocols that are secure against eavesdroppers and dishonest players. The proposed QSS protocols eliminate the need for each player preparing the laser source and laser phase locking of the overall players. The dealer can implement the parameter evaluation and get the secret information of each player without the cooperation from other players. We consider the practical security of the proposed QSS systems with Trojan-horse attack, untrusted source intensity fluctuating and untrusted noisy sources. Our QSS systems are versatile, they can support the QCKA protocol by only modifying the classic post-processing and requiring no changes to the underlying hardware architecture. We experimentally implement the QSS and QCKA protocol with five parties over 25 km (55 km) single mode fibers, and achieve a key rate of 0.0061 (7.14*10^-4) bits per pulse.

    "abstract": "Optical knots and links, consisting of trajectories of phase or polarisation singularities, are intriguing nontrivial three-dimensional topologies. They are theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in paraxial and non-paraxial regimes, as well as in random and speckle fields. Framed and nested knots can be employed in security protocols for secret key sharing, quantum money, and topological quantum computation. The topological nature of optical knots suggests that environmental disturbances should not alter their topology; therefore, they may be utilised as a resilient vector of information. Hitherto, the robustness of these nontrivial topologies under typical disturbances encountered in optical experiments has not been investigated. Here, we provide the experimental analysis of the effect of optical phase aberrations on optical knots and links. We demonstrate that Hopf links, trefoil and cinquefoil knots exhibit remarkable robustness under misalignment and phase aberrations. The observed knots are obliterated for high aberration strengths and defining apertures close to the characteristic optical beam size. Our observations recommend employing these photonics topological structures in both classical and quantum information processing in noisy channels where optical modes are strongly affected and not applicable.

Here we present a solution to IPO-IMPT using a distributed parallel computing framework that was used to simulate the underlying quantum physics processes involved in radiation transport. We also present animal study simulations to demonstrate the need for doing Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT). Methods: We have developed software which simultaneously optimizes the geometry of a patient-specific set of range compensating bars and range modulating pins, and the weights of a FLASH proton pencil beam spot map, for dose, instantaneous dose rate (IDR), and LET. The method uses the Open Science Grid (OSG), a distributed computing cluster, to efficiently complete the computationally intensive calculations. We also introduce the concept of a \"restricted influence grid\" as a technique for significantly improving computational performance. Additionally, animal study simulations were performed using TOPAS. Results: Our optimization technique created a sizable improvement in IDR and LET in the organs at risk (OARs) of our test patient with a negligible sacrifice to dose coverage of the CTV when compared to traditional IMPT. Our animal studies demonstrate that extra biological dose (XBD) should potentially be used to optimize for biological parameters in addition to physical parameters. Conclusion: This solution to IPO-IMPT is a promising tool for patient treatment planning which has the potential to be used to more effectively spare heathly tissue via the FLASH effect without sacrificing tumor killing efficacy.

    "abstract": "Solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs) with the variational inference (VI) method is promising but still challenging. The main difficulties arise from two aspects. First, VI methods approximate the posterior distribution using a simple and analytic variational distribution, which makes it difficult to estimate complex spatially-varying parameters in practice. Second, VI methods typically rely on gradient-based optimization, which can be computationally expensive or intractable when applied to BIPs involving partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating the high-dimensional posterior distribution. This approach leverages a deep generative model to learn a prior model capable of generating spatially-varying parameters. This enables posterior approximation over the latent variable instead of the complex parameters, thus improving estimation accuracy. Moreover, to accelerate gradient computation, we employ a differentiable physics-constrained surrogate model to replace the adjoint method. The proposed method can be fully implemented in an automatic differentiation manner. Numerical examples demonstrate two types of log-permeability estimation for flow in heterogeneous media. The results show the validity, accuracy, and high efficiency of the proposed method. ",

One such source is the superradiant laser, which relies on collectively interacting ultra long lived dipoles driven by incoherent light. Here we discuss a different way of generating spectrally pure light by coherently driving such dipoles inside an optical QED cavity. The light exiting the cavity carries information about the detuning between the driving light and the atomic transition, but is also affected by the noise originating from all the decoherence processes that act on the combined atom-cavity system. We calculate these effects to obtain fundamental limits for frequency estimation and stabilization across a range of values of input light intensities and atom-light interaction strengths, estimate these limits in state-of-the-art cavity experiments with alkaline-earth atoms and identify favorable operating conditions. We find that the achievable linewidths are comparable to those of the superradiant laser. ",

Yet, for its practicality, the main challenge to overcome is improving the quantum measurement efficiency. Numerous quantum measurement techniques have been developed recently, but it is unclear how these state-of-the-art measurement techniques will perform in extensions of VQE for obtaining excited electronic states. Assessing the measurement techniques' performance in the excited state VQE is crucial because the measurement requirements in these extensions are typically much greater than in conventional VQE, as one must measure the expectation value of multiple observables in addition to that of the electronic Hamiltonian. Here, we adapt various measurement techniques to two widely used excited state VQE algorithms: multi-state contraction and quantum subspace expansion. Then, the measurement requirements of each measurement technique are numerically compared. We find that the best methods for multi-state contraction are ones utilizing Hamiltonian data and wavefunction information to minimize the number of measurements. In contrast, randomized measurement techniques are more appropriate for quantum subspace expansion, with many more observables of vastly different energy scales to measure. Nevertheless, when the best possible measurement technique for each excited state VQE algorithm is considered, significantly fewer measurements are required in multi-state contraction than in quantum subspace expansion.
