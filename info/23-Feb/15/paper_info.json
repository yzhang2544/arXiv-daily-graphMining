    "abstract": "We report the creation of super-high-flux gamma-rays with energy >8 MeV and photo-neutrons via the (g,n) reaction near giant dipole resonance energies (8 - 20 MeV), using the ~130 J Texas Petawatt laser to irradiate high-Z (Au, Pt, Re, W) targets of mm - cm thickness, at laser intensities up to ~5x1021W/cm2. We detected up to ~ several x 1012 gamma-rays > 8 MeV (~3% of incident laser energy) and ~ 1010 photo-neutrons per shot. Due to the short pulse and narrow gamma-ray cone (~17o half-width) around laser forward, the peak emergent gamma-ray flux >8 MeV reached ~1027 gammas/cm2/sec, and the peak emergent neutron flux reached ~1020 neutrons/cm2/sec. Such intense gamma-ray and neutron fluxes are among the highest achieved for short-pulse laser experiments. They will facilitate the study of nuclear reactions requiring super-high-flux of gamma-rays or neutrons, such as the creation of r-process elements. These results may also have far-reaching applications for nuclear energy, such as the transmutation of nuclear waste. ",

    "title": "The current unbalance in stacked REBCO tapes -- simulations based on a  circuit grid model",
    "abstract": "Unlike low temperature superconducting cables, there is so far no perfect solution for REBCO coated conductors to form a fully transposed high current cable. Every REBCO cable concept must import a stack of tapes to achieve an operating current as high as tens of kiloamperes. The stacked REBCO tapes, no matter whether they are twisted or not, however, have a nature of non-transposing and therefore could result in current unbalance. In this manuscript, the current unbalance and the related electrical characteristics of a cable made of 40 stacked REBCO tapes are studied with an electrical circuit simulation. The differences in splice resistances and tape inductances that are both related to the non-transposed structure of a REBCO stack are considered. Results show that for a 40 cm long termination, a proper method to keep the contact resistivity between each tape and the copper termination around 1e-8 ohmm is crucial to totally avoid current unbalance lowering the cable performance. Surprisingly, the inter-tape current transfer is found to be able to further exacerbate local high current though it does make the overall distribution more balanced. The inductance difference induced current unbalance is only important if local defects exist at long REBCO tapes, which on the other hand can be cured by good inter-tape current transfer. For a fast-charging rate of 1 kA/s, the inter-tape contact resistivity should also be low to a level of 1e-8 ohmm to ensure a short current transfer length of around 1 m. ",

At energies below the 100 cm-1 well depth of the interaction potential, we observed backward glories originating from peculiar U-turn trajectories. At energies below 0.2 cm-1, we observed a breakdown of the Langevin capture model, which we interpreted in terms of a suppressed mutual polarization during the collision, effectively switching off the molecular dipole moments. Scattering calculations based on an ab initio NO-ND3 potential energy surface revealed the crucial role of near-degenerate rotational levels with opposite parity in low-energy dipolar collisions. ",

This design is based on a fractal structure known as the \"Devil's staircase\". To assess its optical performance, numerical simulations have been performed with a ray tracing program using the Liou-Brennan model eye under polychromatic illumination. The simulated through the focus visual acuity was the merit function employed to test its pupil-dependence and its behavior against decentering. A qualitative assessment of the multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) was also performed experimentally with an adaptive optics visual simulator. The experimental results confirm our numerical predictions. We found that our MIOL design has a trifocal profile, which is very robust to decentration and has low degree of pupil dependence. It performs better at intermediate distances than at near distances and, for a pupil diameter of 3 mm, it works like an EDoF lens over almost the entire defocus range. ",

We study the propagation of ultra-short, TW power ionizing laser pulses in a 10-meter-long rubidium vapor and the plasma columns they create. We perform experiments and numerical simulations for pulses with 780 nm central wavelength, which is resonant with the D$_2$ transition from the ground state of rubidium atoms, as well as for pulses with 810 nm central wavelength, some distance from resonances. We measure transmitted energy and transverse width of the pulse and use schlieren imaging to probe the plasma column in the vapor close to the end of the vapor source. We find, that resonant pulses are more confined in a transverse direction by the interaction than off-resonant pulses are and that the plasma channels they create are more sharply bounded. Off-resonant pulses leave a wider layer of partially ionized atoms and thus lose more energy per unit propagation distance. Using experimental data, we estimate the energy required to generate a 20-meter-long plasma column and conclude that resonant pulses are much more suitable for creating a long, homogeneous plasma. ",

    "abstract": "The higher efficiency of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities compared to normal-conducting ones enables the development of high-energy continuous-wave linear accelerators (linacs). Recent progress in the development of high-quality Nb$_3$Sn film coatings along with the availability of cryocoolers with high cooling capacity at 4 K makes it feasible to operate SRF cavities cooled by thermal conduction at relevant accelerating gradients for use in accelerators. A possible use of conduction-cooled SRF linacs is for environmental applications, requiring electron beams with energy of $1 - 10$ MeV and 1 MW of power. We have designed a 915 MHz SRF linac for such an application and developed a prototype single-cell cavity to prove the proposed design by operating it with cryocoolers at the accelerating gradient required for 1 MeV energy gain. The cavity has a $\\sim 3$ $\\mu$m thick Nb$_3$Sn film on the inner surface, deposited on a $\\sim4$ mm thick bulk Nb substrate and a bulk $\\sim7$ mm thick Cu outer shell with three Cu attachment tabs. The cavity was tested up to a peak surface magnetic field of 53 mT in liquid He at 4.3 K. A horizontal test cryostat was designed and built to test the cavity cooled with three Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers. The rf tests of the conduction-cooled cavity, performed at General Atomics, achieved a peak surface magnetic field of 50 mT and stable operation was possible with up to 18.5 W of rf heat load. The peak frequency shift due to microphonics was 23 Hz. These results represent the highest peak surface magnetic field achieved in a conduction-cooled SRF cavity to date and meet the requirements for a 1 MeV energy gain. ",

In this paper, we analyze the main sources of errors in current (IBM) quantum computers and we present a useful tool (TED-qc) designed to facilitate the total error probability expected for any quantum circuit. We propose this total error probability as the best way to estimate the fidelity in the NISQ era, mainly because we do not have to compare our quantum calculations with any classical one. In order to contrast the robustness of our tool we compute the total error probability that may occur in three different quantum models: 1) the four-electron Ising model, 2) the Quantum-Phase Estimation (QPE) and 3) the Grover's algorithm. For each model, we compute a statistically significant sample size for both the expectation value of the related observable and the fidelity, comparing them with the value calculated in the simulator as a function of the error probability. The analysis is satisfactory in more than the $99\\%$ of the cases. In addition, we study how the error mitigation techniques are able to eliminate the noise induced during the measurement. ",

Flow properties are universally determined in a unified way in terms of the Reynolds number ${\\cal R}$ (dimensionless, ratio of inertial to viscous forces in incompressible fluids). For example, the drag coefficient $c_D$ of objects with similar shapes moving in fluids is expressed by a universal function of ${\\cal R}$. Certain studies introduced similar dimensionless numbers, that is, the superfluid Reynolds number ${\\cal R}_s$, to characterize turbulent flows in superfluids. However, the applicablity of the similitude to inviscid quantum fluids is nontrivial as the original theory is applicable to viscous fluids. This study proposed a method to verify the similitude using current experimental techniques in quantum liquid He-II. A highly precise relation between $c_D$ and ${\\cal R}_s$ was obtained in terms of the terminal speed of a macroscopic body falling in He-II at finite temperatures across the Knudsen (ballistic) and hydrodynamic regimes of thermal excitations.

Both cavity and waveguide QED share the common goal of harnessing and deepening the understanding of light-matter coupling. However, they often rely on very different experimental set-ups and theoretical descriptions. Here, we experimentally investigate the transition from cavity to waveguide QED with an ensemble of cold atoms that is coupled to a fiber-ring resonator, which contains a nanofiber section. By varying the length of the resonator from a few meters to several tens of meters, we tailor the spectral density of modes of the resonator while remaining in the strong coupling regime. We demonstrate that for progressively longer resonators, the paradigmatic Rabi oscillations of cavity QED gradually vanish, while non-Markovian features reminiscent of waveguide QED appear. ",
