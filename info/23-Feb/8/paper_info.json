    "abstract": "Quantum computing has emerged as a promising platform for simulating strongly correlated systems in chemistry, for which the standard quantum chemistry methods are either qualitatively inaccurate or too expensive. However, due to the hardware limitations of the available noisy near-term quantum devices, their application is currently limited only to small chemical systems. One way for extending the range of applicability can be achieved within the quantum embedding approach. Herein, we employ the projection-based embedding method for combining the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, although not limited to, with density functional theory (DFT). The developed VQE-in-DFT method is then implemented efficiently on a real quantum device and employed for simulating the triple bond breaking process in butyronitrile. The results presented herein show that the developed method is a promising approach for simulating systems with a strongly correlated fragment on a quantum computer. The developments as well as the accompanying implementation will benefit many different chemical areas including the computer aided drug design as well as the study of metalloenzymes with a strongly correlated fragment.

    "abstract": "In this work, the development of two-dimensional current sheets with respect to tearing-modes, in collisionless plasmas with a strong guide field, is analysed. During their non-linear evolution, these thin current sheets can become unstable to the formation of plasmoids, which allows the magnetic reconnection process to reach high reconnection rates. We carry out a detailed study of the impact of a finite $\\beta_e$, which also implies finite electron Larmor radius effects, on the collisionless plasmoid instability. This study is conducted through a comparison of gyrofluid and gyrokinetic simulations. The comparison shows in general a good capability of the gyrofluid models in predicting the plasmoid instability observed with gyrokinetic simulations. We show that the effects of $\\beta_e$ promotes the plasmoid growth. The impact of the closure applied during the derivation of the gyrofluid model is also studied through the comparison of the energy variation. ",

In this work, electro-optically controlled optical metasurfaces operating in reflection and utilizing resonant waveguide mode excitation are demonstrated from the viewpoint of free-space propagating light modulation. The modulation of reflected light power with superior characteristics in comparison with prior research is achieved by identifying a suitable low-loss waveguide mode and exploiting its resonant excitation. The electro-optic Pockels effect in a 300-nm-thick lithium niobate (LN) film sandwiched between a continuous thick gold film and an array of gold nanostripes, serving also as control electrodes, is exploited to realize fast and efficient light modulation. The fabricated compact (active area <1000 $\\mu$m) modulators operate in the wavelength range of 850-950 nm, featuring a maximum intensity modulation depth of $\\sim\\!$ 42 % at the driving voltage of $\\pm$10 V within the bandwidth of 13.5 MHz (with the potential bandwidth of 6.5 GHz). The introduced nonlocal electro-optic metasurface configuration opens new avenues towards the realization of ultrafast, efficient and robust free-space light modulators based on an LN flat optics approach.

Hybrid modes are a promising way to make heterogeneous Si/III-V devices, but it is still unclear how to engineer these modes to make photonic crystal cavities. Herein, using 3D finite-difference time-domain simulation, a hybrid Si-GaAs photonic crystal cavity design enables cavity mode confinement in GaAs without directly patterning that operates at telecom wavelengths. The hybrid cavity consists of a patterned silicon waveguide nanobeam that is evanescently coupled to a GaAs slab with quantum dots. We show that by engineering the hybrid modes, we can control the degree of coupling to the active material, which leads to a tradeoff between cavity quality factor and optical gain and nonlinearity. With this design, we demonstrate a cavity mode in the Si-GaAs heterogeneous region, which enables strong interaction with the quantum dots in the GaAs slab for applications such as low-power-threshold lasing and optical bistability (156 nW and 18.1 ${\\mu}$W, respectively). This heterogeneous integration of an active III-V material with silicon via a hybrid cavity design suggests a promising approach for achieving on-chip light generation and low-power nonlinear platforms.

Recent advances in higher-order band topology have discovered another type of topological state, as manifested by those modes localized at the corners of a sample, which are known as corner states. Here we report the realization of a quadrupole higher-order topological insulator phase in a gyromagnetic PhC, induced by a topological phase transition from the previously demonstrated Chern insulator phase. The evolution of the boundary modes from propagating chiral edge states to localized corner states has been characterized by microwave measurements. We also demonstrate topological bound states in the continuum, when the gyromagnetic PhC is magnetically tuned. These results extend the quadrupole topological insulator phase into T-broken systems, and integrate topologically protected propagating and localized modes in the same platform. ",

This combination of properties makes PCMs a fast-growing platform for active, low-energy nanophotonics, including tunability to otherwise passive thin-film optical coatings. Here, we integrate the PCM Sb2Se3 into a novel four-layer thin-film optical coating that exploits photonic Fano resonances to achieve tunable structural colors in both reflection and transmission. We show, contrary to traditional coatings, that Fano-resonant optical coatings (FROCs) allow for achieving transmissive and reflective structures with narrowband peaks at the same resonant wavelength. Moreover, we demonstrate asymmetric optical response in reflection, where Fano resonance and narrow-band filtering are observed depending upon the light incidence side. Finally, we use a multi-objective inverse design via machine learning (ML) to provide a wide range of solution sets with optimized structures while providing information on the performance limitations of the PCM-based FROCs. Adding tunability to the newly introduced Fano-resonant optical coatings opens various applications in spectral and beam splitting, and simultaneous reflective and transmissive displays, diffractive objects, and holograms.

We present results of the ammonia absorption line profile reconstruction with a bandwidth of 1 cm-1 and a resolution of 0.08 cm-1.

    "abstract": "Silicon modulators are key components in silicon photonics to support the dense integration of electro-optic (EO) functional elements on a compact chip for various applications including high-speed data transmission, signal processing, and photonic computing. Despite numerous advances in promoting the operation speed of silicon modulators, a bandwidth ceiling of 67 GHz emerges in practices and becomes an obstacle to paving silicon photonics toward Tbps level data throughput on a single chip. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a design strategy for silicon modulators by employing the slow light effect, which shatters the present bandwidth ceiling of silicon modulators and pushes its limit beyond 110 GHz in a small footprint. The proposed silicon modulator is built on a coupled-resonator optical waveguide (CROW) architecture, in which a set of Bragg gratings are appropriately cascaded to give rise to a slow light effect. By comprehensively balancing a series of merits including the group index, photon lifetime, electrical bandwidth, and losses, we found the modulators can benefit from the slow light for better modulation efficiency and compact size while remaining their bandwidth sufficiently high to support ultra-high-speed data transmission. Consequently, we realize a modulator with an EO bandwidth of 110 GHz in a length of 124 {\\mu}m, and demonstrate a data rate beyond 110 Gbps by applying simple on-off keying modulation for a DSP-free operation. Our work proves that silicon modulators beyond 110 GHz are feasible, thus shedding light on the potentials of silicon photonics in ultra-high-bandwidth applications such as data communication, optical interconnection, and photonic machine learning.

Microbubbles containing liquid or solid cores are referred to as antibubbles. The manufacturing process of long-lived antibubbles involves the adsorption of colloidal particles at the interfaces, a process called Pickering stabilisation. With and without cores present inside, Pickering-stabilised microbubbles generate a harmonic response, even at modest transmission amplitudes. Therefore, Pickering-stabilised ultrasound contrast agents may be of interest in contrast-enhanced ultrasonic imaging. In a previous study, we determined that the presence of a core inside Pickering-stabilised microbubbles slightly hampered the oscillation amplitude compared to identical microbubbles without a core. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether the absence of a core negatively influences the stability of Pickering-stabilised microbubbles under sonication. ",

Within the unitary coupled cluster framework, we develop COMPASS, a disentangled ansatz construction protocol that can dynamically tailor an optimal ansatz using the one and two-body cluster operators and a selection of rank-two scatterers. The construction of the ansatz may potentially be performed in parallel quantum architecture through energy sorting and operator commutativity prescreening.

We find that niobium microwave resonators exhibit an order of magnitude decrease in quality-factors after surface argon milling, while aluminum resonators are resilient to the same process. Extensive analysis of the niobium surface shows no change in the suboxide composition due to argon milling, while two-tone spectroscopy measurements reveal an increase in two-level system electrical dipole moments, indicating a structurally altered niobium oxide hosting larger two-level system defects.
