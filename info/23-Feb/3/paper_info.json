    "abstract": "Optical solitons are known to be classically stable objects which are robust to perturbations. In this work, we show that due to quantum mechanical effects, an optical soliton that is initially in a classical soliton coherent state will shed photons into the continuum and hence decay. The standard formulation of the quantized soliton uses the linearized version of the quantum nonlinear Schrodinger equation in the background of the classical soliton, and the quantized soliton remains stable in this approximation. We show that if higher-order interaction terms are taken into account, the soliton is no longer stable, and its photon number decreases quadratically as a function of the number of soliton cycles. We compute the power spectrum for the continuum radiation and find a narrow band that is localized about the initial soliton momentum with a cut-off that is inversely proportional to the initial soliton width.

    "abstract": "Inverse-designed Silicon photonic metastructures offer an efficient platform to perform analog computations with electromagnetic waves. However, due to computational difficulties, scaling up these metastructures to handle a large number of data channels is not trivial. Furthermore, a typical inverse-design procedure utilizes a small computational domain and therefore tends to employ resonant features to achieve its objectives. This results in structures that are narrow-bandwidth and highly sensitive to fabrication errors. Here, we employ a 2D inverse-design method based on the effective index approximation with a low-index contrast constraint. This results in compact amorphous lens systems which are generally feed-forward and low-resonance. We designed and experimentally demonstrated a vector-matrix product for a 2 x 2 and a 3 x 3 matrix. We also designed a 10 x 10 matrix using the proposed 2D computational method. These examples demonstrate that these techniques have the potential to enable larger-scale wave-based analog computing platforms. ",

    "title": "Ring Artifact Correction in Photon-Counting Spectral CT Using a  Convolutional Neural Network With Spectral Loss",
    "abstract": "Photon-counting spectral computed tomography is now clinically available. These new detectors come with the promise of higher contrast-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution and improved low-dose imaging. However, one important design consideration is to build detector elements that are sufficiently homogeneous. In practice, there will always be a degree of inhomogeneity in the detector elements, which will materialize as variations in the energy bin thresholds. Without proper detector calibration, this will lead to streak artifacts in the sinograms and corresponding ring artifacts in the reconstructed images, which limit their clinical usefulness. Since detector calibration is a time-consuming process, having access to a fast ring correction technique may greatly improve workflow. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based post-processing technique for ring artifact correction in photon-counting spectral CT. We train a UNet with a custom loss to correct for ring artifacts in the material basis images. Our proposed loss is made ``task-aware'' by explicitly incorporating the fact that we are working with spectral CT by combining a L1-loss operating on the material basis images with a perceptual loss, using VGG16 as feature extractor, operating on 70 keV virtual monoenergetic images. Our results indicate that using this novel loss greatly improves performance. We demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully produce ring corrected 40, 70, and 100 keV virtual monoenergetic images. ",

However, only a few passive geometries have been developed that work on these points. Here, we introduce a novel non-Hermitian structure based on an infinity-shaped microresonator twice coupled to a bus waveguide: the Infinity-Loop Microresonator. Unlike other structures working at an exceptional point, such as a taiji microresonator, the infinity-loop microresonator can achieve either high-contrast or low-contrast unidirectional reflection with a negligible or identical reflection for counterpropagating light. It allows an easy walking through the Riemann sheet by simply controlling the phase of the light propagating in the bus waveguide which makes it a tunable component to build more complex topological structures. Furthermore, the infinity-loop microresonator allows sensors which show the features of both an exceptional point device and a diabolic point device simultaneously. ",

    "abstract": "We experimentally investigate the nonlinear dynamics of ultrashort laser pulses propagating in gas-filled hollow capillary fibres in different dispersion regimes, which are achieved by tuning the gas pressure. When the pulse propagates in the anomalous dispersion regime we observe soliton dynamics accompanied with soliton-plasma effects, such as self-compression, resonant dispersive-wave emission in the fundamental as well as in higher-order modes, soliton blue-shifting and ionisation-induced pulse splitting. Propagation of the pulse in the vicinity of the zero-dispersion wavelength results in pulse splitting and subsequent cross-phase modulation leading to the generation of an additional frequency-shifted band and a 3-octave broad supercontinuum. In the case of pulses propagating in normal dispersion we observe the generation of a broad and flat supercontinuum. In this regime, the experimental results are less well described by simulations that consider only the propagation dynamics inside the fibre. Free-space simulations of the beam propagation in the bulk gas, before the capillary entrance, suggest that this discrepancy is caused by self-focusing and ionisation altering the pulse spatial and temporal shape, affecting both the coupling efficiency and the subsequent propagation inside the capillary.

We report that the moir\\'e potential in a molybdenum disulfide/tungsten diselenide (MoS2/WSe2) heterobilayer system can significantly enhance light emission, elongate the IX lifetime, and modulate the IX emission energy at room temperature. By integrating a moir\\'e superlattice with a silicon topological nanocavity, we achieve ultra-low-threshold lasing at the technologically important telecommunication O-band thanks to the significant moir\\'e modulation. Moreover, the high-quality topological nanocavities facilitate the highest spectral coherence of < 0.1 nm linewidth among all reported two-dimensional material-based laser systems. Our findings not only open a new avenue for studying correlated states at elevated temperatures, but also enable novel architectures for integrated on-chip photonics and optoelectronics. ",

After quantifying the performance by detecting short-circuit faults in a multi-layer silicon die, we assess how a QDM would detect faults in a heterogeneously integrated (HI) die stack. This work establishes QDM-based magnetic imaging as a competitive technique for electronics FA, offering high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and robust instrumentation. We anticipate these advantages to be especially useful for finding faults deep within chip-stack ICs with many metal layers, optically-opaque layers, or optically-scattering layers. ",

At each iteration the model computes the horizontal propulsion of the droplet due to impacts with the fluid bath. The propulsion is calculated based on the interaction of the droplet with the wavefield produced by the eigenmode excitations.

While multi-photon entangled NOON states can in principle beat the shot-noise limit and reach the Heisenberg limit, high NOON states are difficult to prepare and fragile to photon loss which hinders it from reaching unconditional quantum metrological advantages. Here, we combine the idea of unconventional nonlinear interferometers and stimulated emission of squeezed light, previously developed for photonic quantum computer Jiuzhang, to propose and realize a new scheme that achieves a scalable, unconditional, and robust quantum metrological advantage. We observe a 5.8(1)-fold enhancement above the shot-noise limit in the Fisher information extracted per photon, without discounting for photon loss and imperfections, which outperforms ideal 5-NOON states. The Heisenberg-limited scaling, the robustness to external photon loss, and the ease-to-use of our method make it applicable in practical quantum metrology at low photon flux regime. ",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this study is to review the Schenberg resonant antenna transfer function and to recalculate the antenna design strain sensitivity for gravitational waves. We consider the spherical antenna with six transducers in the semi dodecahedral configuration. When coupled to the antenna, the transducer-sphere system will work as a mass-spring system with three masses. The first one is the antenna effective mass for each quadrupole mode, the second one is the mass of the mechanical structure of the transducer first mechanical mode and the third one is the effective mass of the transducer membrane that makes one of the transducer microwave cavity walls. All the calculations are done for the degenerate (all the sphere quadrupole mode frequencies equal) and non-degenerate sphere cases. We have come to the conclusion that the 'ultimate' sensitivity of an advanced version of Schenberg antenna (aSchenberg) is around the standard quantum limit (although the parametric transducers used could, in principle, surpass this limit). However, this sensitivity, in the frequency range where Schenberg operates, has already been achieved by the two aLIGOs in the O3 run, therefore, the only reasonable justification for remounting the Schenberg antenna and trying to place it in the sensitivity of the standard quantum limit would be to detect gravitational waves with another physical principle, different from the one used by laser interferometers. This other physical principle would be the absorption of the gravitational wave energy by a resonant mass like Schenberg. ",

Small-signal equations for the up-converted signal in both architectures are formulated and developed, which permit to quantify the CG from closed-form expressions. The numerically calculated CG values are in very good agreement with those obtained experimentally. The validated equations are subsequently employed to explain the performance differences between the two architectures in terms of the CG. Furthermore, signals modulated by QPSK and 16-QAM complex modulation formats at different baud rates are up-converted from 750 MHz to 9.25 GHz and 39.75 GHz and their Error Vector Magnitude is evaluated and compared.
