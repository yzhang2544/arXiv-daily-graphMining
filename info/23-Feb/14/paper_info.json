    "abstract": "Optical lattices with periodic potentials have attracted great attention in modern optics and photonics, enabling extensive applications in atomic manipulation, optical trapping, optical communications, imaging, sensing, etc. In the last decade, the generation of optical lattices has been widely investigated by various approaches such as multi-plane-wave interferometer, beam superposition, spatial light modulators, nanophotonic circuits, etc. However, all of the previous state-of-the-art works are restricted to only one or two dimensions of the light field, which cannot fulfill the increasing demand on complex light manipulation. Full-dimensional and dynamic control of the light field, including spatial amplitude, phase and polarization, is quite challenging and indispensable for the generation of sophisticated optical lattices. Here, we propose and demonstrate a reconfigurable integrated full-dimensional optical lattice generator, i.e. a photonic emitting array (PEA) enabling reconfigurable and full-dimensional manipulation of optical lattices, in which 4x4 photonic emitting units (PEUs) with 64 thermo-optic microheaters are densely integrated on a silicon chip. By engineering each PEU precisely with independent and complete control of optical properties of amplitude, phase and polarization, various optical vortex lattices, cylindrical vector beam lattices, and vector vortex beam lattices can be generated and reconfigured in the far field. The demonstrated integrated optical lattice generator paves the way for the miniaturization, full-dimensional control and enhanced flexibility of complex light manipulation. ",

This dependency is rationalized by investigating surface gravity wave modes in the cavity formed by the disk. We show that the jump oscillation frequency systematically matches one of the surface wave disk-cavity eigenfrequencies, leading to the conclusion that the oscillations are self-induced by the interaction between the jump and surface waves eigenmodes.

For many applications the interaction of quantum plasmas with energetic particles is crucial. Moreover, often the system is driven far out of equilibrium. In that case, there is high interest in time-dependent simulations to understand the physics, in particular, during thermalization. Recently a novel many-particle technique, the G1--G2 scheme was presented [N. Schl\\\"unzen et al., Phys. Rev.

    "abstract": "The near-field spectroscopic information is critically important to determine the Forster resonant energy transfer(FRET) rate and the distance dependence in the vicinity of metal surfaces. The high density of evanescent near-field modes in the vicinity of a metal surface can strongly modulate the FRET in multichromophoric systems. Based on the previous generalized FRET [A. Poudel, X. Chen and M. Ratner, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7(2016) 955], the theory of FRET is generalized for the multichromophore aggregates and nonequilibrium situations in the vicinity of evanescent surface electromagnetic waves of nanophotonic structures. The classic dyadic green function (DGF) approach to multichromophoric FRET (MC-FRET) in the existence of evanescent near-field is established. The classic DGF approach provides a microscopic understanding of the interaction between the emission and absorption spectral coupling and the evanescent electromagnetic field. The MC-FRET of the ring structures demonstrates complicated distance dependence in the vicinity of the silver thin film. Given the analytic expression of hyperbolic multi-layer thin film, the generalized coupling due to the metallic thin film is determined by the scattering DGF above the metal surface. The decomposition of the reduced scattering DGF by ignoring $S$ wave in the evanescent wave shows how the interface of the metallic thin films modulates the MC-FRET. ",

Especially in quantum technology education, the ability to employ such practices is an essential skill to foster both academic success and technological development. In order to help educators design effective instructions, the comparison between novices' and experts' eye movements allows the identification of efficient information extraction and integration strategies. In this work, we compare the gaze behavior of experts and novices while solving problems in quantum physics using an interactive simulation tool, Quantum Composer, which displays information via multiple external representations (numerical values, equations, graphs). During two reasoning tasks, we found that metarepresentational competences were crucial for successful engagement with the simulation tool. The analysis of the gaze behavior revealed that visual attention on a graph plays a major role and redundant numerical information is ignored. Furthermore, the total dwell time on relevant and irrelevant areas is predictive for the score in the second task. Therefore, the results demonstrate which difficulties novices encounter when using simulation tools and provides insights for how to design effective instructions in quantum technology education guided by experts' gaze behavior.

    "abstract": "Understanding the ultrafast processes at their natural-time scale is crucial for controlling and manipulating nanoscale optoelectronic devices under light-matter interaction. Here, we demonstrate that ultrafast plasmon resonances, attributed to the phenomenon of Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT), can be significantly modified by tuning the spectral and temporal properties of the ultrashort light pulse. In this scheme, all-optical active tuning governs spatial and temporal enhancement of plasmon oscillations in the EOT system without device customization. We analyze the spectral and temporal evolution of the system through two approaches. First, we develop a theoretical framework based on the coupled harmonic oscillator model, which analytically describes the dynamics of plasmon modes in the coupled and uncoupled state. Later, we compare the evolution of the system under continuous wave and pulsed illumination. Further, we discuss time-resolved spectral and spatial dynamics of plasmon modes through 3D-FDTD simulation method and wavelet transform. Our results show that optical tuning of oscillation time, intensity, and spectral properties of propagating and localized plasmon modes yields a 3-fold enhancement in the EOT signal. The active tuning of the EOT sensor through ultrashort light pulses pave the way for the development of on-chip photonic devices employing high-resolution imaging and sensing of abundant atomic and molecular systems.

Such metasurfaces provide electric and magnetic responses to an incoming electromagnetic (EM) wave, leading to unidirectional scattering and 2$\\pi$ phase coverage. We herein report a near-reflectionless coarsely discretized dielectric Huygens' metasurface that performs anomalous refraction, offering a low-loss platform for wave manipulation at high frequencies as compared to their lossy metallic analogue. The coarse discretization dramatically simplifies the design, resulting in a metasurface that is highly efficient, cost-effective, and robust. In this paper, the proposed metasurface comprises two meta-atoms per period and is hence named the bipartite dielectric Huygens' metasurface. Through full-wave simulations at 28 GHz, we show that the proposed metasurface can reroute an incident EM wave from $\\theta_i=15^{\\circ}$ to $\\theta_t=-44.5^{\\circ}$ with very high efficiency: 87% of the scattered power is anomalously transmitted to $\\theta_t$.

However, Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) from human activities affects sensitive radio telescopes, and significantly affects the quality of observation. Thus, RFI detection and mitigation for the observations is necessary to obtain high quality, science-ready data. The flagging of RFI is particularly challenging for the solar and space weather observations at low frequency, because the solar radio bursts can be brighter than the RFI, and may show similar temporal behavior. In this work, we investigate RFI flagging methods for solar and space weather observations, including a strategy for AOFlagger, and a novel method that makes use of a morphology convolution. These algorithms can effectively flag RFI while preserving solar radio bursts. ",

In this work, we extend methods for quantum simulation with Bloch orbitals constructed from symmetry-adapted atom-centered orbitals so that one can model periodic \\textit{ab initio} Hamiltonians using only a modest number of basis functions. We focus on adapting existing algorithms based on combining qubitization with tensor factorizations of the Coulomb operator. Significant modifications of those algorithms are required to obtain an asymptotic speedup leveraging translational (or, more broadly, Abelian) symmetries. We implement block encodings using known tensor factorizations and a new Bloch orbital form of tensor hypercontraction. Finally, we estimate the resources required to deploy our algorithms to classically challenging model materials relevant to the chemistry of Lithium Nickel Oxide battery cathodes within the surface code.

The antihelical edge states robustly propagate across the corners toward the diagonal of the square lattice: The same (opposite) pseudospins copropagate in the same (opposite) direction on the parallel lattice boundaries; the different pseudospins separate and converge at the opposite corners. The antihelical edge states in the topological metallic phase alter to the helical edge states in the topological insulating phase under a metal-insulator phase transition. The antihelical edge states provide a unique manner of topologically-protected robust light transport applicable for topological purification.

In optics, vortices manifest as phase twists of the electromagnetic field, commonly formed by the interaction of light and matter. Formation of vortices by effective interaction of light with itself requires strong optical nonlinearity and has therefore been confined, until now, to the classical regime. Here we report on the realization of quantum vortices resulting from a strong photon-photon interaction in a quantum nonlinear optical medium. The interaction causes faster phase accumulation for co-propagating photons. Similarly to a plate pushing water, the local phase accumulation produces a quantum vortex-antivortex pair within the two-photon wavefunction. For three photons, the formation of vortex lines and a central vortex ring attests to a genuine three-photon interaction. The wavefunction topology, governed by two- and three-photon bound states, imposes a conditional phase shift of $\\pi$-per-photon, a potential resource for deterministic quantum logic operations. ",

    "title": "Low frequency electrical waves in ensembles of proteinoid microspheres",
    "abstract": "Proteinoids (thermal proteins) are produced by heating amino acids to their melting point and initiation of polymerisation to produce polymeric chains. Amino acid-like molecules, or proteinoids, can condense at high temperatures to create aggregation structures called proteinoid microspheres, which have been reported to exhibit strong electrical oscillations. When the amino acids L-Glutamic acid (L-Glu) and L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) were combined with electric fields of varying frequencies and intensities, electrical activity resulted. We recorded electrical activity of the proteinoid microspheres' ensembles via a pair of differential electrodes. This is analogous to extracellular recording in physiology or EEG in neuroscience but at micro-level. We discovered that the ensembles produce spikes of electrical potential, an average duration of each spike is 26 min and average amplitude is 1 mV. The spikes are typically grouped in trains of two spikes. The electrical activity of the ensembles can be tuned by external stimulation because ensembles of proteinoid microspheres can generate and propagate electrical activity when exposed to electric fields.
