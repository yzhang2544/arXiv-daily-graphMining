    "abstract": "Optomechanical cavities are powerful tools for classical and quantum information processing that can be realized using nanophotonic structures that co-localize optical and mechanical resonances. Typically, phononic localization requires suspended devices that forbid vertical leakage of mechanical energy. Achieving this in some promising quantum photonic materials such as diamond requires non-standard nanofabrication techniques, while hindering integration with other components and exacerbating heating related challenges. As an alternative, we have developed a semiconductor-on-diamond platform that co-localizes phononic and photonic modes without requiring undercutting. We have designed an optomechanical crystal cavity that combines high optomechanical coupling with low dissipation, and we show that this platform will enable optomechanical coupling to spin qubits in the diamond substrate. These properties demonstrate the promise of this platform for realizing quantum information processing devices based on spin, phonon, and photon interactions. ",

    "abstract": "A non-resonant cavity to build up laser intensity is modeled, developed and tested. It can be used for overlapping multiple lasers of different wavelengths, increasing their intensities by over an order of magnitude while maintaining good uniformity. It is simple to set up, has flexible optical characteristics, and is robust against perturbations. The intensity buildup requires no resonances, and the wavelength dependence of the performance is limited only by the mirror coatings. The cavity can be used in applications requiring a spatially-constrained intensity buildup, for example in atomic and molecular traps. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic Floquet lattices provide an excellent platform for manipulating different topologically protect-ed edge states. However, anti-chiral edge states have not been discussed much in Floquet lattices. Here, we propose a waveguide structure by combining two honeycomb Floquet photonic lattices with oppo-site rotation directions. In this structure, we find that the anti-chiral edge states have the same trans-mission direction on two parallel body edges. With an increasing modulation phase difference between the two sublattices in one direction, the width of the band gap becomes smaller and the robustness of the edge states becomes weaker. Interestingly, the transmission speed is also controlled by the phase difference. In addition to their relevance for the topological properties of the Floquet lattice system, these results may be applied to multi-channel optical switches, optical functional devices, and in other fields.

Here, we show theoretical evidence that twodimensional (2D) even-layer MnBi2Te4 allows for the simultaneous presence of intercorrelated ferroelectricity, AFM, and QAHE. Importantly, through rational van der Waals sliding, these exotic properties are strongly coupled. Such coupling could demonstrate many distinctive physics, for example, ferroelectric control of itinerant AFM phase and the sign of quantized anomalous Hall plateau.The explored phenomena and mechanism would not only enrich the research in 2D ferroelectricity and topological magnets, but also guide the design of low-consumption high-speed quantum devices.

    "abstract": "Acceleration of polarized electron~(positron) beams in a booster synchrotron may suffer from depolarization due to crossings of many spin depolarization resonances, which could limit its applications. We have studied the spin depolarization resonance structure of a 100~km scale booster lattice of the Circular Electron Positron Collider~(CEPC). The lattice has 8 arc regions with hundreds of FODO cells, interleaved with straight sections, which leads to a high periodicity. Our analysis shows the contributions to the strength of intrinsic and imperfection spin resonances add up coherently near the super strong resonances beyond 120 GeV, but mostly cancel out and result in generally weak resonance strengths at lower beam energies. Detailed simulations confirm that beam polarization can be mostly maintained in the fast acceleration to 45.6 GeV and 80 GeV, but severe depolarization may occur at even higher energies. This study suggests the possibility of acceleration of polarized electron~(positron) beams to ultra-high beam energies without the help of Siberian snakes, and supports injecting highly polarized beams into the collider rings as an attractive solution for resonant depolarization measurements and longitudinal polarized colliding beam experiments for future 100~km scale circular e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders.

We provide the most extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems to date, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy, and novel algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods towards quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.

    "abstract": "We calculate the frequency-dependent longitudinal and Hall conductivities and the Faraday and Kerr rotation angles for a single sheet of anisotropic Dirac semimetal protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. While the magnetic field causes a rotation of the plane of polarization of the light, the anisotropy causes the appearance of an elliptically polarized component in an initially linearly polarized beam. The two effects can be combined in a single complex Faraday rotation angle. At the zero-frequency limit, we find a finite value of the Faraday rotation angle, which is given by $2\\alpha_F$, where $\\alpha_F$ is the effective fine structure constant associated with the velocity of the linearly dispersing Dirac fermions. We also find a logarithmic enhancement of the Faraday (and Kerr) rotation angles as the frequency of the light approaches the absorption edge associated with the magnetic field-induced gap. While the enhancement is reduced by impurity scattering, it remains significant for an attainable level of material purity. These results indicate that two-dimensional Dirac materials protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry are responsive to weak magnetic fields and can be used as platforms for magneto-optic applications, such as the realization of polarization-rotating devices.
