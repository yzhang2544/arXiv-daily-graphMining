Additionally, we propose an unsupervised way of estimating the optimal wavelet basis along with the model parameters. We apply the method to experimental Raman spectra of phthalocyanine blue, aniline black, naphthol red, pigment yellow 150, and pigment red 264 pigments to remove their additive background and to CARS spectra of adenosine phosphate, fructose, glucose, and sucrose to remove their multiplicative background signals.

    "title": "Seismic Arrival-time Picking on Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data using  Semi-supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology for earthquake monitoring and subsurface imaging. The recorded seismic signals by DAS have several distinct characteristics, such as unknown coupling effects, strong anthropogenic noise, and ultra-dense spatial sampling. These aspects differ from conventional seismic data recorded by seismic networks, making it challenging to utilize DAS at present for seismic monitoring. New data analysis algorithms are needed to extract useful information from DAS data. Previous studies on conventional seismic data demonstrated that deep learning models could achieve performance close to human analysts in picking seismic phases. However, phase picking on DAS data is still a difficult problem due to the lack of manual labels. Further, the differences in mathematical structure between these two data formats, i.e., ultra-dense DAS arrays and sparse seismic networks, make model fine-tuning or transfer learning difficult to implement on DAS data. In this work, we design a new approach using semi-supervised learning to solve the phase-picking task on DAS arrays. We use a pre-trained PhaseNet model as a teacher network to generate noisy labels of P and S arrivals on DAS data and apply the Gaussian mixture model phase association (GaMMA) method to refine these noisy labels to build training datasets. We develop a new deep learning model, PhaseNet-DAS, to process the 2D spatial-temporal data of DAS arrays and train the model on DAS data. The new deep learning model achieves high picking accuracy and good earthquake detection performance. We then apply the model to process continuous data and build earthquake catalogs directly from DAS recording. Our approach using semi-supervised learning provides a way to build effective deep learning models for DAS, which have the potential to improve earthquake monitoring using large-scale fiber networks.

    "abstract": "We detail the derivation of nanolaser models that include coherent and incoherent variables and predict the existence of a laser threshold, irrespective of cavity size and emitter number, for both single- and multi-electron systems. The growth in photon number in the lasing mode is driven by an increase in correlation between absorption and emission processes, leading to the onset of self-sustained stimulated emission (laser threshold), followed, in turn, by a correlation decrease and ending with the dominance of coherent emission. The first-order coherence $g^{(1)}$ steadily increases, as the pump grows towards the laser threshold value, and reaches unity at or beyond threshold. The transition toward coherent emission becomes increasingly sharp as the number of emitters and of the coupled electromagnetic cavity modes increase, continuously connecting, in the thermodynamic limit, the physics of nano- and macroscopic lasers at threshold. Our predictions are in remarkable agreement with experiments whose first-order coherence measurements have so far been explained only phenomenologically. A consistent evaluation of different threshold indicators provides a tool for a correct interpretation of experimental measurements at the onset of laser action. ",

Here, we present interface Self-Referenced (iSR) D-FFOCT, an alternative configuration to D-FFOCT that takes advantage of the presence of the sample coverslip in between the sample and the objective by using it as a defocused reference arm, thus avoiding the aforementioned artefacts.

The two major components of an XFEL are an accelerator-produced electron beam and a magnetic undulator which tend to be kilometer-scale long and expensive. Here, we present an ultra-compact scheme to produce 10s of attosecond X-ray pulses with several GW peak power utilizing a novel aspect of the FEL instability using a highly chirped, pre-bunched and ultra-bright electron beam from a plasma-based accelerator interacting with an optical undulator. The self-selection of electrons from the combination of a highly chirped and pre-bunched beam leads to the stable generation of attosecond X-ray pulses. Furthermore, two-color attosecond pulses with sub-femtosecond separation can be produced by adjusting the energy distribution of the electron beam so that multiple FEL resonances occur at different locations within the beam. Such a tunable coherent attosecond X-ray sources may open up a new area of attosecond science enabled by X-ray attosecond pump/probe techniques. ",

The Ge post-treatment were performed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 450 and 700 C degrees. The sensors were characterized by X-ray diffraction diffractogram and scanning electron microscopy. It is demonstrated that the sensors are highly sensitive as human breath detectors, with rapid response and frequency detect-ability.

Inspired by experimental advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics and the fabrication and control of two-dimensional magnets, we investigate the fate of a quantum critical antiferromagnet coupled to an optical cavity field. Using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the scaling behavior of the magnetic structure factor and other observables. While the position and universality class are not changed by a single cavity mode, the critical fluctuations themselves obtain a sizable enhancement, scaling with a fractional exponent that defies expectations based on simple perturbation theory. The scaling exponent can be understood using a generic scaling argument, based on which we predict that the effect may be even stronger in other universality classes. Our microscopic model is based on realistic parameters for two-dimensional magnetic quantum materials and the effect may be within the range of experimental detection. ",

Here, we investigate the strong interaction between a PIM and cavity magnon polaritons (CMPs) by driving a cavity magnonic system away from equilibrium with a microwave pump. In our experiment, the Walker mode simultaneously couples with the PIM and cavity photons and thus combines two strongly coherent coupling processes in a single cavity structure. Such a PIM-CMP hybridization system acquires complementary properties from both the PIM and CMPs, allowing it to be freely manipulated by the magnetic field, the pump power and the pump frequency. These coherent manipulations exhibit unique behaviors beyond the intrinsic properties limited by the material nature and electromagnetic boundary conditions, thereby creating opportunities for extending the control of hybrid devices.
