    "abstract": "           This introductory text on the basics of quantum mechanics is intended to serve as a kind of travel guide through the quantum world. It starts by asking whether quantum physics is important, or weird, or incomprehensible. It explains why particles sometimes behave like waves, and how uncertainty and randomness enter physics, before explaining a number of historically important experiments. Modern topics, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantum computing are also covered. Essential concepts, such as the uncertainty principle, are analyzed in depth, employing a slightly increased dose of mathematics. This is the English version of the first part of a manual intended as a companion to the \"Treffpunkt Quantenmechanik\" (meeting point quantum mechanics), a laboratory at TU Dortmund University, where high-school students can get acquainted with the wonderful world of quantum physics. The second part of the manual contains detailed instructions for the individual experiments available in the lab and is not available on the Internet.         ",

    "abstract": "           The sensitivity of a gold-silver bilayer system for gas detection was investigated using angle-fixed reflectance measurements and numerical calculations based on the transfer-matrix method. Two configurations of bilayer systems were analyzed: gold on silver and silver on gold. According to calculations, the best sensitivity values were achieved with a total thickness of approximately 55 nm for the gold on silver system and approximately 65 nm for the silver on gold system. These calculations were supported by experimental results in a Kretschmann configuration for ethanol gas sensing. The bilayer systems showed a huge advantage compared to the widely used single gold thin film, however, special attention should be paid to the silver on gold configuration, as corrosion plays an important role in decreasing sensitivity.

    "abstract": "           Plasma is capable of mediating the conversion of two pump photons into two different photons through a relativistic four-wave mixing nonlinearity. Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.         ",

Central to the func-tionality of the SuperNANO system is its capacity for simultaneous nanoimaging and nanopatterning, enabling the creation of anti-counterfeiting markings and precision cutting with exceptional accuracy. The SuperNANO system, featuring a unibody superlens objective, achieves a resolution ranging from 50 to 320 nm. We showcase the instrument's versatility through its application in generating high-security anti-counterfeiting features on an aluminum film. These 'invisible' security features, which are nanoscale in dimension, can be crafted with arbi-trary shapes at designated locations. Moreover, the system's precision is further evidenced by its ability to cut silver nanowires to a minimum width of 50 nm.

    "abstract": "           Quantum few-body systems are deceptively simple. Indeed, with the notable exception of a few special cases, their associated Schrodinger equation cannot be solved analytically for more than two particles. One has to resort to approximation methods to tackle quantum few-body problems. In particular, variational methods have been proposed to ease numerical calculations and obtain precise solutions. One such method is the Stochastic Variational Method, which employs a stochastic search to determine the number and parameters of correlated Gaussian basis functions used to construct an ansatz of the wave function. Stochastic methods, however, face numerical and optimization challenges as the number of particles increases. We introduce a family of gradient variational methods that replace stochastic search with gradient optimization. We comparatively and empirically evaluate the performance of the baseline Stochastic Variational Method, several instances of the gradient variational method family, and some hybrid methods for selected few-body problems. We show that gradient and hybrid methods can be more efficient and effective than the Stochastic Variational Method. We discuss the role of singularities, oscillations, and gradient optimization strategies in the performance of the respective methods.         ",

This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons.

    "abstract": "           We have investigated non-dipole effects in the interaction of a hydrogen atom with elliptically polarized laser pulses of intensity 10$^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ with about 8 fs duration. The study was performed within the framework of a hybrid quantum-quasiclassical approach in which the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron and the classical Hamilton equations for the center-of-mass (CM) of an atom are simultaneously integrated. It is shown that the spatial inhomogeneity $ \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}$ of the laser field and the presence of a magnetic component in it lead to the non-separability of the CM and electron variables in a neutral atom and, as a consequence, to its acceleration. We have established a strict correlation between the total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom and the velocity of its CM acquired as a result of interaction with a laser pulse. The acceleration of the atom weakly depends on the polarization of the laser in the considered region (\\mbox{5 eV $\\lesssim \\hbar\\omega \\lesssim $ 27 eV}) of its frequencies. However, the transition from linear to elliptical laser polarization leads to the twisting of the atom relative to the axis directed along the pulse propagation (coinciding with the direction of the momentum of the accelerated atom). It is shown that with increasing ellipticity the twisting effect increases and reaches its maximum value with circular polarization. At this point the projection of the orbital angular momentum acquired by the electron onto the direction of the pulse propagation reaches its maximum value. Further exploration of the possibilities for producing accelerated and twisted atoms with electromagnetic pulses is of interest for a number of prospective applications.         ",

However, they have been primarily limited to capturing partial information of the three parameters, tailored to specific optical fields, which poses challenges when addressing with arbitrary field distributions and achieving three-parameter imaging. In this study, we introduce a MS-based approach for single-shot optical imaging that simultaneously captures all the three parameters of optical fields with arbitrary intensity, phase, and polarization distributions.

This constrains minimal size of the optically switched magnetic bits and minimal wavelengths of the optically excited spin waves in optomagnonic devices thus preventing its further progress. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel method of the selective optical excitation of the short exchange spin waves by using a specially designed magnetophotonic grating. This method is based on the creation of the sign-changing profile of the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) induced in a magnetic film due to excitation of the optical guided TE-mode by a femtosecond laser pulse. The spatial period of the IFE profile is subdiffractive which allows to launch narrow band short spin waves whose wavelengths are around 300 nm as was experimentally demonstrated and potentially can be made down to ~ 100 nm. This opens new horizons for optomagnetic applications that are wide ranging, from logical elements to data processing devices.         ",

A quantum walk is a quantum version of a random walk that demonstrates a faster propagation than a random walk on a graph. We focus on the fact that the effect of the depth-first search process is dominant when a quantum walk with a superposition state is applied to graphs. Simply using a quantum walk with its superposition state leads to insufficient performance since balancing the depth-first and breadth-first search processes is essential in node classification tasks. To overcome this disadvantage, we formulate novel coin operators that determine the movement of a quantum walker to its neighboring nodes. They enable QWalkVec to integrate the depth-first search and breadth-first search processes by prioritizing node sampling. We evaluate the effectiveness of QWalkVec in node classification tasks conducted on four small-sized real datasets. As a result, we demonstrate that the performance of QWalkVec is superior to that of the existing methods on several datasets. Our code will be available at \\url{this https URL}.         ",

    "abstract": "           The braking torque that dictates the timing properties of magnetars is closely tied to the large-scale dipolar magnetic field on their surface. The formation of this field has been a topic of ongoing debate. One proposed mechanism, based on macroscopic principles, involves an inverse cascade within the neutron star's crust. However, this phenomenon has not been observed in realistic simulations. In this study, we provide compelling evidence supporting the feasibility of the inverse cascading process in the presence of an initial helical magnetic field within realistic neutron star crusts and discuss its contribution to the amplification of the large-scale magnetic field. Our findings, derived from a systematic investigation that considers various coordinate systems, peak wavenumber positions, crustal thicknesses, magnetic boundary conditions, and magnetic Lundquist numbers, reveal that the specific geometry of the crustal domain - with its extreme aspect ratio - requires an initial peak wavenumber from small-scale structures for the inverse cascade to occur. However, this extreme aspect ratio limits the inverse cascade to magnetic field structures on scales comparable to the neutron star's crust, making the formation of a large-scale dipolar surface field unlikely. Despite this limitation, the inverse cascade can significantly impact the magnetic field evolution in the interior of the crust, potentially explaining the observed characteristics of highly magnetized objects with weak surface dipolar fields, such as low-field magnetars or central compact objects.

Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.

    "abstract": "           Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, $B$, that confines charged particles effectively in a three-dimensional toroidal plasma equilibrium. Here, we show that QS has a deep connection to the underlying symmetry that makes solitons possible. We uncover a hidden lower dimensionality of $B$ on a magnetic flux surface, which could make stellarator optimization schemes significantly more efficient. Recent breakthroughs (M. Landreman and E. Paul, PRL 2022) have yielded configurations with excellent volumetric QS and surprisingly low magnetic shear. Our approach elucidates why the magnetic shear is low in these configurations. Given $B$, we deduce an upper bound on the maximum toroidal volume that can be quasisymmetric only from the properties of $B$ and verify it for the Landreman-Paul precise quasiaxisymmetric (QA) stellarator configuration. In the neighborhood of the outermost surface, we show that $B$ approaches the form of the 1-soliton reflectionless potential. The connection length diverges, indicating the possible presence of an X-point that could potentially be used as basis for a divertor. We present three independent approaches to demonstrate that quasisymmetric $B$ is described by well-known integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and Gardner's equation. The first approach is weakly nonlinear multiscale perturbation theory. We show that the overdetermined problem of finding quasisymmetric vacuum fields admits solutions for which the rotational transform and the magnetic shear are highly constrained. Our second approach is non-perturbative and based on ensuring single-valuedness of $B$, which directly leads to its Painlev\u00e9 property shared by the KdV equation. Our third machine-learning-based approach robustly recovers the KdV (and Gardner's equation) from a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators.         ",

    "abstract": "           A new high-granular compact time-of-flight neutron detector for the identification and energy measurement of neutrons produced in nucleus-nucleus interactions at the BM@N experiment, Dubna, Russia, at energies up to 4 AGeV is under development. The detector consists of approximately 2000 fast plastic scintillators, each with dimensions of 40$\\times$40$\\times$25 mm$^3$, equiped with SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier) with an active area of 6$\\times$6 mm$^2$. The signal readout from these scintillators will employ a single-threshold multichannel Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) to measure their response time and amplitude using the time-over-threshold (ToT) method. This article focuses on the analytical description of the signals from the plastic scintillator detectors equipped with silicon photomultipliers. This description is crucial for establishing the ToT-amplitude relationship and implementing slewing correction techniques to improve the time resolution of the detector. The methodology presented in this paper demonstrates that a time resolution at the 70 ps level can be achieved for the fast plastic scintillator coupled with silicon photomultiplier with epitaxial quenching resistors.

    "abstract": "           This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the thermodynamics of black holes, focusing on foundational concepts such as free energy, entropy, and topological numbers, alongside a detailed examination of quantum RN black holes. By extending the discussion to encompass the symmetry groups SO(2), SO(3)/SO(2), and SO(3) within the framework of (f(R)) gravity, the paper offers a nuanced understanding of black hole physics. Key insights include the pivotal role of free energy and entropy in understanding the thermodynamic properties of black holes, the significance of topological numbers in determining thermodynamic stability and phase transitions, and the implications of quantum mechanics and (f(R)) gravity on traditional thermodynamic concepts. This exploration not only enriches our theoretical knowledge of black holes but also sets the stage for future empirical investigations, marking a pivotal contribution to our ongoing quest to decipher the universe's mysteries.

Full on-chip measurements of input capacitance and I-V characteristics of the transistor were carried out, and from measured data a conductance of 66.9 uS was calculated, and hence a cut-off frequency of 1.69 THz was calculated from the fabricated nvFET .

    "abstract": "           We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=1/2$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.         ",

    "abstract": "           Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \\to [\\textit{activated complex}]^\\# \\to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\\to [ODD]^{\\#} \\to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \\to [ArHCl]^{\\#} \\to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.         ",

    "abstract": "           The NEXT-White detector, a high-pressure gaseous xenon time projection chamber, demonstrated the excellence of this technology for future neutrinoless double beta decay searches using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to measure energy and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to extract topology information. This analysis uses $^{83m}\\text{Kr}$ data from the NEXT-White detector to measure and understand the energy resolution that can be obtained with the SiPMs, rather than with PMTs. The energy resolution obtained of (10.9 $\\pm$ 0.6) $\\%$, full-width half-maximum, is slightly larger than predicted based on the photon statistics resulting from very low light detection coverage of the SiPM plane in the NEXT-White detector. The difference in the predicted and measured resolution is attributed to poor corrections, which are expected to be improved with larger statistics. Furthermore, the noise of the SiPMs is shown to not be a dominant factor in the energy resolution and may be negligible when noise subtraction is applied appropriately, for high-energy events or larger SiPM coverage detectors. These results, which are extrapolated to estimate the response of large coverage SiPM planes, are promising for the development of future, SiPM-only, readout planes that can offer imaging and achieve similar energy resolution to that previously demonstrated with PMTs.
