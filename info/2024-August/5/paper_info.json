    "title": "Adaptive optical signal-to-noise ratio recovery for long-distance optical fiber transmission",
    "abstract": "           In long-distance fiber optic transmission, the optic fiber link and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers can introduce excessive noise, which reduces the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The narrow-band optical filters can be used to eliminate noise and thereby improve OSNR. However, there is a relative frequency drift between the signal and the narrow-band filter, which leads to filtered signal instability. This paper proposes an adaptive OSNR recovery scheme based on a Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity with mode width of 6 MHz. Utilizing the comb filtering of F-P cavity, the noise around the carrier and sidebands of the signal is filtered out simultaneously. To avoid frequency mismatch, we propose a double-servo scheme to suppress relative frequency drift between the signal and the F-P cavity. We constructed a stable radio frequency transfer system based on passive phase compensation and compared our scheme with other OSNR recovery schemes based on optical filters. Compared to the schemes based on dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and Waveshaper, our scheme demonstrates an improvement in OSNR of carrier by at least 12 dB and sidebands by at least 23.5 dB. The short-term transfer stability (1 s) is improved by one order of magnitude compared to DWDM and half an order of magnitude compared to Waveshper. This scheme can be applied to the recovery of signals with low OSNR in long-distance fiber optic transmission, improving signal quaility and extending the transmission distance limit.         ",

    "abstract": "           Spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) has become an emerging approach to realize organized wavepackets in high-dimensional nonlinear photonic systems. Mode-locking in one dimensional systems employs a saturable absorber to resist fluctuations in the temporal domain. Analogous suppression of fluctuations in the space-time domains to retain a consistent output should also exist for STML. However, experimental evidence of such a resistance remains elusive, to our knowledge. Here, we report experimental observation of such a spatiotemporal stabilizer in STML, by embedding a spatial light modulator (SLM) into a multi-mode fibre (MMF) laser. Mode decomposition reveals the mode content remains steady for an STML state when applying phase perturbations on the SLM. Conversely, the mode content changes significantly for a non-STML lasing state. Numerical simulations confirm our observation and show that spatial filtering and saturable absorber mainly contribute to the observed stability. The capability to resist the spatial phase fluctuations is observed to depend on the intracavity pulse energy as well as the modal pulse energy condensed in the low-order modes. Our work constitutes another building block for the concept of STML in multi-mode photonic systems.         ",

Due to the transfer of the angular momenta between the light and the bilayer, optical beams with zero SAM and OAM acquire SAM upon transmission and OAM upon reflection. Our numerical calculations and the developed analytical theory show that the values of the emergent SAM and OAM depend differently on the interlayer distance and can be controlled by tuning the twist angle. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and are caused by the helicity-dependent light diffraction on the moir\u00e9 pattern, which inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and SAM-OAM conversion. We also reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\u00e9-diffracted beams.         ",

Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the electrical tuning of one PCM layer in a spatial light modulation device, and thermal analysis guides the design of DONN devices and systems to avoid thermal crosstalk if individual heterostacks are assembled into an array. Further, heterostacks containing three PCM layers are designed to have a large phase modulation range and uniform coverage and the ML performance of DONN systems with designed heterostacks is evaluated.

    "abstract": "           Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single photon emitters (SPEs) offer numerous advantages to quantum information applications, such as high single photon purity and deterministic positioning. Strain in the host monolayer, induced by underlying dielectric Mie resonators, is known to localize their formation to positions co-located with near-field photonic hotspots providing further control over their optical properties. However, traditional materials used for the fabrication of nanoresonators, such as silicon or gallium phosphide (GaP), often require a high refractive index substrate resulting in losses of the emitted light and limited photonic enhancement. Here, we use nanoantennas (NAs) fabricated from multilayer TMDs, which allow complete flexibility with the choice of substrate due to the adhesive van der Waals forces, enabling high refractive index contrast or the use of highly reflective metallic surfaces. We demonstrate the localized formation of SPEs in WSe$_2$ monolayers transferred onto WS$_2$ NAs on both SiO$_2$ and Au substrates, enabling strong photonic enhancements and increased single photon collection. We provide evidence for enhanced quantum efficiencies (QE) reaching an average value of 43% (7%) for SPEs on WS$_2$ NAs on a SiO$_2$ (Au) substrate. We further combine the advantages offered by both dielectric and metallic substrates to numerically simulate an optimized NA geometry for maximum WSe$_2$ single photon excitation, emission, collection. Thus, the fluorescence is enhanced by a factor of over 4 orders of magnitude compared to vacuum and 5 orders of magnitude compared to a flat SiO$_2$/Si surface. Our work showcases the advantages offered by employing TMD material nanoresonators on various substrates for SPE formation and photonic enhancement.         ",

The high ability for lithiation comes along with massive volume changes and a problematic voltage hysteresis, causing reduced efficiency, detrimental heat generation, and a complicated state-of-charge estimation. During slow cycling, amorphous silicon nanoparticles show a larger voltage hysteresis than after relaxation periods. Interestingly, the voltage relaxes for at least several days, which has not been physically explained so far. We apply a chemo-mechanical continuum model in a core-shell geometry interpreted as a silicon particle covered by the solid-electrolyte interphase to account for the hysteresis phenomena. The silicon core (de)lithiates during every cycle while the covering shell is chemically inactive. The visco-elastoplastic behavior of the shell explains the voltage hysteresis during cycling and after relaxation. We identify a logarithmic voltage relaxation, which fits with the established Garofalo law for viscosity. Our chemo-mechanical model describes the observed voltage hysteresis phenomena and outperforms the empirical Plett model. In addition to our full model, we present a reduced model to allow for easy voltage profile estimations. The presented results support the mechanical explanation of the silicon voltage hysteresis with a core-shell model and encourage further efforts into the investigation of the silicon anode mechanics.

Yet, this characteristic wave nature has only been observed in double-slit experiments with microscopic systems, such as atoms and molecules. The key aspect is that the wavefunction describing the motion of these systems extends coherently over a distance comparable to the slit separation, much larger than the size of the system itself. Preparing these states of more massive and complex objects remains an outstanding challenge. While the motion of solid-state oscillators can now be controlled at the level of single quanta, their coherence length remains comparable to the zero-point motion, limited to subatomic distances. Here, we prepare a delocalized state of a levitating solid-state nanosphere with coherence length exceeding the zero-point motion. We first cool its motion to the ground state. Then, by modulating the stiffness of the confinement potential, we achieve more than a threefold increment of the initial coherence length with minimal added noise. Optical levitation gives us the necessary control over the confinement that other mechanical platforms lack. Our work is a stepping stone towards the generation of delocalization scales comparable to the object size, a crucial regime for macroscopic quantum experiments, and towards quantum-enhanced force sensing with levitated particles.

Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. We examine the optical properties by studying the imaginary part of the dielectric function by solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on top of GW approximation. By calculating the SLME, we achieve an efficiency of 32.7% for Si$_{22}$ at a thickness of 500 nm. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures.
