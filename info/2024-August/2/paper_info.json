    "title": "Full Inverse Compton Scattering: Total Transfer of Energy and Momentum from Electrons to Photons",
    "abstract": "           In this article we discuss a peculiar regime of Compton Scattering that assures the maximum transfer of energy and momentum from free electrons propagating in vacuum to the scattered photons. We name this regime Full Inverse Compton Scattering (FICS) because it is characterized by the maximum and full energy loss of the electrons in collision with photons: up to 100 % of the electron kinetic energy is indeed transferred to the photon. In the case of relativistic electrons, characterized by a large Lorentz factor (gamma >> 1), FICS regime corresponds to an incident photon energy equal to mec^2/2 . We interpret such an astonishing result as FICS being the time reversal of direct Compton Scattering of very energetic photons (of energy much greater than mec2) onto atomic electrons. Although the cross section of Compton scattering is decreasing with the energy of the incident photon, making the process less probable with respect to other reactions (pair production, nuclear reactions, etc) when high energetic photons are bombarding a target, the kinematics straightforwardly implies that the back-scattered photons would have an energy reaching asymptotically me^2c^2 . FICS is instead the unique suitable working point in Compton scattering for achieving the total transfer of (kinetic) energy exactly from the electron to the photon. Experiencing transitions from the initial momentum to zero in the laboratory system, in FICS the electron is also subject to very large negative acceleration; this fact can lead to possible experiments of sensing the Unruh temperature and related photon bath. On the other side of the energy dynamic range, low relativistic electrons can be completely stopped by moderate energy photons (tens of keV), leading to full exchange of temperature between electron clouds and photon baths.

    "abstract": "           Whispering gallery mode (WGM) optomechanical resonators are a promising technology for the simultaneous control and measurement of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. They offer potential for use across a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers. Double-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and optical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly attractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated fabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been demonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of double-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate functional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical coupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical quality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical coupling of approximately 15 kHz.         ",

By further applying a bichromatic modulation composed of two radio-frequency signals oppositely detuned from the resonant frequency in the microresonator, we build different time-dependent Hamiltonians with the time-varying nearest-neighbor coupling strength in synthetic frequency lattice. We measure the temporal features from capturing the dynamic band structures of the lattice and demonstrate a variety of time-dependent synthetic lattice models by engineering the driven pattern of the modulation, highlighting great flexibility of the microresonator.

Among various generation schemes, resonant electro-optic combs are particularly attractive for its excellent stability, flexibility and broad bandwidths. In this approach, an optical pump undergoes multiple electro-optic modulation processes in a high-Q optical resonator, resulting in cascaded spectral sidebands. However, most resonant electro-optic combs to date make use of lumped-capacitor electrodes with relatively inefficient utilization of the input electrical power. This design also reflects most electrical power back to the driving circuits and necessitates costly RF isolators in between, presenting substantial challenges in practical applications. To address these issues, we present an RF circuit friendly electro-optic frequency comb generator incorporated with on-chip coplanar microwave resonator electrodes, based on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Our design achieves more than three times electrical power reduction with minimal reflection at the designed comb repetition rate of ~ 25 GHz. We experimentally demonstrate broadband electro-optic frequency comb generation with a comb span of >85 nm at a moderate electrical driving power of 740 mW (28.7 dBm). Our power-efficient and isolator-free electro-optic comb source could offer compact, low-cost and simple-to-design solution for applications in spectroscopy, high-precise metrology, optical communications.

OTCliM addresses the challenge of efficiently obtaining reliable site-specific $C_n^2$ climatologies, crucial for ground-based astronomy and free-space optical communication. Using gradient boosting machines and global reanalysis data, OTCliM extrapolates one year of measured $C_n^2$ into a multi-year time series. We assess OTCliM's performance using $C_n^2$ data from 17 diverse stations in New York State, evaluating temporal extrapolation capabilities and geographical generalization. Our results demonstrate accurate predictions of four held-out years of $C_n^2$ across various sites, including complex urban environments, outperforming traditional analytical models. Non-urban models also show good geographical generalization compared to urban models, which captured non-general site-specific dependencies. A feature importance analysis confirms the physical consistency of the trained models. It also indicates the potential to uncover new insights into the physical processes governing $C_n^2$ from data. OTCliM's ability to derive reliable $C_n^2$ climatologies from just one year of observations can potentially reduce resources required for future site surveys or enable studies for additional sites with the same resources.

By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization of the incident light and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs.

For the measurements of positron energy and multiplicity spectra, a tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter are foreseen. The expected number of positrons varies over ten orders of magnitude and has to be measured over a widely spread low-energy background. To overcome these challenges, a compact and finely segmented calorimeter is proposed.

This P-D2NN design creates high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction, while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - achieving the desired unidirectional imaging operation using a much smaller number of diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume. Furthermore, P-D2NN design maintains its unidirectional image magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination wavelengths despite being trained with a single wavelength. We also designed a wavelength-multiplexed P-D2NN, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct illumination wavelengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by cascading multiple unidirectional P-D2NN modules, we can achieve higher magnification factors. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also validated experimentally using terahertz illumination, successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors.         ",

An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.

    "abstract": "           Radiation detection is vital for space, medical imaging, homeland security, and environmental monitoring applications. In the past, the Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit, Geant4, has been employed to enable the effective development of emerging technologies in these fields. Radiation detectors utilising scintillator crystals have benefited from Geant4; however, Geant4 optical physics parameters for scintillator crystal modelling are sparse. This work outlines scintillator properties for GAGG:Ce, CLLBC:Ce, BGO, NaI:Tl, and CsI:Tl. These properties were implemented in a detailed SiPM-based single-volume scintillation detector simulation platform developed in this work. It was validated by its comparison to experimental measurements. For all five scintillation materials, the platform successfully predicted the spectral features for selected gamma ray emitting isotopes with energies between 30 keV to 2 MeV. The full width half maximum (FWHM) and normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) between simulated and experimental energy spectra were also compared. The majority of simulated FWHM values reproduced the experimental results within a 2% difference, and the majority of NCCC values demonstrated agreement between the simulated and experimental energy spectra. Discrepancies in these figures of merit were attributed to detector signal processing electronics modelling and geometry approximations within the detector and surrounding experimental environment.

    "abstract": "           Radio Frequency Knock Out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Classically, the beam is excited with an RF field comprising a frequency band around one of the betatron sidebands. This article demonstrates that the third-integer resonance commonly used for the slow extraction induces nonlinear motion, resulting in the appearance of additional sidebands of higher order at multiples of the betatron tune. Measured and simulated beam spectra are presented, revealing these sidebands and the beam's response to being excited at first and second order sidebands. The feasibility of using a second order sideband for the purpose of slow extraction is demonstrated. This results in a significant improvement in the temporal structure (spill quality) of the extracted beam, but at the cost of higher excitation power requirements. This is observed both experimentally and in tracking simulations. The mechanism behind the observed improvement is explained using beam dynamics simulations.         ",

However, there is even scarcer evidence of magneto-optical effects that can spatially modulate light. Here, we demonstrate the latter by exploiting strongly coupled states of semimagnetic matter and light in planar semiconductor microcavities. We nonresonantly excite two spatially adjacent exciton-polariton condensates which, through inherent ballistic near field coupling mechanism, spontaneously synchronise into a dissipative quantum fluidic supermode of definite parity. Applying a magnetic field along the optical axis, we continuously adjust the light-matter composition of the condensate exciton-polaritons, inducing a supermode switch into a higher order mode of opposite parity. Our findings set the ground towards magnetic spatial modulation of nonlinear light.         ",

Here, we develop the single- and many-body theory of these new effective relativistic exciton-polaritons modes and describe their mean field condensation dynamics facilitated by the interplay between protection from the radiative continuum and negative-mass pump induced optical trapping. Our theory accounts for many tunable grating parameters giving full control over the diffractive coupling properties between guided polaritons and the radiative continuum previously unexplored in the context of driven condensation. In particular, we discover stable cyclical condensate solutions mimicking a driven-dissipative analog of the zitterbewegung effect characterized by coherent superposition of both ballistic (rapid phase front) and trapped (slow phase front) polariton waves. Finally, important distinctions are drawn between the concepts of near field and far field in the photonic grating, clarifying recent experimental observations on the emission characteristics of these long lived nonlinear Dirac polaritons.

    "title": "Stable-to-unstable transition in quantum friction",
    "abstract": "           We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper introduces a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems, including constrained and non-binary problems. The algorithm leverages an engineered interference process achieved through repeated application of two unitaries; one inducing phase-shifts dependent on objective function values, and the other mixing phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems, namely those for which solutions are characterised by either a vector of binary variables, a vector of non-binary integer variables, or permutations (a vector of integer variables without repetition). An efficient quantum circuit implementation of the CTQW for each of these problem types is also discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through numerical simulation for randomly generated instances of the following problems (and problem sizes): weighted maxcut (18 vertices), maximum independent set (18 vertices), k-means clustering (12 datapoints, 3 clusters), capacitated facility location (12 customers, 3 facility locations), and the quadratic assignment problem (9 locations). For each problem instance, the algorithm finds a globally optimal solution with a small number of iterations.         ",
