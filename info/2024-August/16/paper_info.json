    "abstract": "           Robust surface states are a defining feature of topological photonic and acoustic systems. Although the supercell technique is commonly used for studying their surface effects, it falls short in sorting the states at two boundaries, differentiating surface states from bulk states, and demanding large computational resources. To overcome the limitations, we employ surface Green's functions combined with two efficient algorithms to obtain the ideal surface states for a semi-infinite system. They are further extended to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. Photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are taken as examples for demonstration and verification. The surface spectra obtained from our approach can be directly used for comparison with experimental observables. Our approach enriches the efficient computational tools for topological photonics and acoustics.         ",

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as a promising solution for constructing atomistic potentials that can be transferred across different molecular and crystalline systems. Most MLIPs are trained only on energies and forces in vacuum, while an improved description of the potential energy surface could be achieved by including the curvature of the potential energy surface. We present Hessian QM9, the first database of equilibrium configurations and numerical Hessian matrices, consisting of 41,645 molecules from the QM9 dataset at the $\\omega$B97x/6-31G* level. Molecular Hessians were calculated in vacuum, as well as water, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene using an implicit solvation model.

The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states near a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix is subject to a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of cylinders on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.         ",

We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate light pulses as short as 24$\\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be synchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17 ps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices the transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we show that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB can be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we demonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based single photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and synchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.

    "abstract": "           Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.

The photonic integrated circuit (PIC) consists of an array of grating couplers that are used to inject light from free space into single-mode waveguides on the chip. Metallic heaters modulate the refractive index of a coiled section of the waveguides, facilitating the co-phasing of the propagating modes. The phased beamlets can then be coherently combined to efficiently deliver the light to an output SMF. In an adaptive optics (AO) system, the phase corrector acts as a deformable mirror (DM) commanded by a controller that takes phase measurements from a wavefront sensor (WFS). We present experimental results for the PIC tested on an AO testbed and compare the performance to simulations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping sub-wavelength-sized particles in all spatial directions has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a trapped particle with a radius of 15 nm experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at short-wave infrared and near-infrared frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.

The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number, Richardson number, Hartmann number, wavy wall peaks, nanoparticle volume fraction, Hartmann angle, rotational speed, and inclination angle, on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. Results reveal that multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluids consistently achieve higher Nusselt numbers than single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) nanofluids, indicating superior heat transfer capabilities. Introducing a second cylinder and a flow deflector enhances thermal interactions, while increasing Ha stabilizes the flow, improving thermal performance. Wavy wall peaks further enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, SWCNT nanofluids exhibit higher Bejan numbers, indicating a greater dominance of thermal entropy generation over fluid friction. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.

    "abstract": "           Scalable isomorphic physical neural networks (PNNs) are emerging NN acceleration paradigms for their high-bandwidth, in-propagation computation. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training is often the industry standard for its robustness and fast gradient convergences, existing BP-PNN training methods need to truncate the propagation of analogue signal at each layer and acquire accurate hidden neuron readouts for deep networks. This compromises the incentive of PNN for fast in-propagation processing. In addition, the required readouts introduce massive bottlenecks due to the conversions between the analogue-digital interfaces to shuttle information across. These factors limit both the time and energy efficiency during training. Here we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, a BP-based method that can perform training on an encapsulated deep network, where the information propagation is maintained within the analogue domain until the output layer. AT's minimum information access bypass analogue-digital interface bottleneck wherever possible. For any deep network structure, AT offers significantly improved time and energy efficiency compared to existing BP-PNN methods, and scales well for large network sizes. We demonstrated AT's error-tolerant and calibration-free training for encapsulated integrated photonic deep networks to achieve near ideal BP performances. AT's well-behaved training is demonstrated repeatably across different datasets and network structures         ",

    "title": "Influence of Point Defects on Laser-Induced Excitation in Silicon",
    "abstract": "           We studied the influence of defect states on the laser excitation process in silicon using time-dependent density functional theory. We assumed two types of point defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the photoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to the color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby relaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low laser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However, as the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of crystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency did not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si vacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our results suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be detected by even-order high-harmonics generation.         ",
