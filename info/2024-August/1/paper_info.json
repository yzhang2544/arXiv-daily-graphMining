    "abstract": "           The RD50-MPW4 is the latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor from the CERN-RD50-CMOS working group, designed to evaluate the HV-CMOS technology in terms of spatial resolution, radiation hardness and timing performance. Fabricated by LFoundry using a 150nm process, it features an improved architecture to mitigate crosstalk, which has been an issue with the predecessor RD50-MPW3, allowing more sensitive threshold settings and full matrix operation. Enhancements include separated power domains for peripheral and in-pixel digital readout, a new backside-biasing step, and an improved guard ring structure supporting biasing up to 500V, significantly boosting radiation hardness. Laboratory measurements and test beam results presented in this paper show significant improvements over its predecessor regarding noise behavior, spatial resolution, and efficiency.         ",

    "abstract": "           The transition of second-generation quantum technologies from a research topic to a topic of industrial relevance has led to a growing number of quantum companies and companies that are exploring quantum technologies. Examples would include a start-up building a quantum key distribution device, a large company working on integrating a quantum sensing core into a product, or a company providing quantum computing consultancy. They all face different challenges and needs in terms of building their quantum workforce and training in quantum concepts, technologies and how to derive value from them. With the study documented in this paper, we aim to identify these needs and provide a picture of the industry's requirements in terms of workforce development and (external) training and materials. We discuss, for example, the shortage of engineers and jobs relevant to the quantum industry, the challenge of getting people interested in quantum, and the need for training at different levels and in different formats - from awareness raising and self-learning materials to university courses in quantum systems engineering. The findings are based on 34 semi-structured interviews with industry representatives and a follow-up questionnaire to validate some of the issues raised in the interviews. These results have influenced activities in EU projects, including an update of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Single-mode semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection have been shown to trigger a wide range of dynamical behavior from injection locking to chaos. Multi-wavelength lasers add even more degrees of freedom and complexity to the dynamical repertoire potentially unlocking new functionalities for applications ranging from THz generation and processing to all-optical memories. In particular, leveraging the inherent mode coupling in multi-wavelength lasers, spectral multiplication over a THz range of an injected optical signal has been shown. While most of the research on optical injection has been focused on single-mode semiconductor lasers, the dynamical behavior of multi-wavelength lasers, particularly when subjected to injection of amplitude-modulated signals remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we numerically and experimentally investigate the response of an on-chip dual-wavelength laser subject to the optical injection of a single-sideband signal around one of the modes of the laser. Our findings show an asymmetric power evolution of the sidebands appearing around both the injected and un-injected modes with respect to the modulation frequency. The power and bandwidth of the sideband signals strongly depend on the resonance frequency produced by the interference between the cavity mode and the injection, which can be tailored by twerking the strength and the detuning of the injection. The outcomes of our numerical investigations, based on rate equations, align closely with the experimental results highlighting the influence of key injection and laser parameters.         ",

Our findings reveal that, in the vast majority of cases, adequate temporal disorder in local space can make the electromagnetic field statistically localized, obeying a normal distribution at a specific point in time of arbitrary location within the cavity. We employ the concept of disordered space-time crystals and leverage Lindeberg's and Lyapunov's theorems to theoretically prove the normal distribution of the field values. Furthermore, we find that with the increase of energy provided by time variation, the probability of extreme fields will significantly increase and the field intensity eventually is de-normalized, that is, deviating from the normal distribution. This study not only sheds light on the statistical properties of transient signals in local-disordered time-varying systems but also paves the way for further exploration in wave dynamics of analogous systems.

In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytic solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.75C to 5.5C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...

    "abstract": "           Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.

    "abstract": "           Resonant vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and quantized field modes of low-frequency optical cavities constitutes the conceptual cornerstone of vibro-polaritonic chemistry. In this work, we theoretically investigate complementary nonresonant electron-cavity mode-interactions in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer (CBO) approximation. We focus on cavity-induced modifications of local and non-local electronic interactions in dipole-coupled molecular ensembles under VSC. Methodologically, we combine CBO perturbation theory (CBO-PT) [Fischer, Saalfrank, JCTC 19, 7215 (2023)] with non-perturbative CBO Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theories. Wave function approaches are reformulated to self-consistently address a cavity reaction potential (CRP), which minimizes the electronic energy in the cavity subspace. We derive up to second-order CBO-PT corrections of intra- and intermolecular energies revealing non-trivial corrections to dipole-dipole, dipole-induced-dipole and van-der-Waals interactions, and provide analytical second-order CRP for unimolecular and interacting bimolecular scenarios. In the unimolecular case, we find small local modifications of molecular PES for selected isomerization reactions dominantly captured by the first-order dipole fluctuation. Excellent agreement between CBO-PT and non-perturbative wave function results is obtained indicating minor VSC-induced state relaxation effects in the single-molecule limit. In the bimolecular scenario, CBO-PT reveals an explicit coupling of interacting dimers to cavity modes besides cavity-polarization dependent dipole-induced-dipole and van-der-Waals interactions with enhanced long-range character. An illustrative CBO-CCSD-based numerical analysis of selected molecular dimer models provides a complementary non-perturbative perspective on cavity-modified intermolecular interactions under VSC.
