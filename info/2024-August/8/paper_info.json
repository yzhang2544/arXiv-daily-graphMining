    "abstract": "           All modern theories of gravitation, starting with Newton's, predict that gravity will affect the speed of light propagation. Einstein's theory of General Relativity famously predicted that the effect is twice the Newtonian value, a prediction that was verified during the 1919 solar eclipse. Recent theories of vector gravity can be interpreted to imply that gravity will have a different effect on pulsed light versus continuous-wave (CW) light propagating between the two mirrors of an optical cavity. Interestingly, we are not aware of any previous experiments to determine the relative effect of gravity on the propagation of pulsed versus CW light. In order to observe if there are small differences, we use a 6 GHz electro-optic frequency comb and low-noise CW laser to make careful measurements of the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse optical cavity. Once correcting for the effects of mirror dispersion, we determine that the cavity resonance frequencies for pulsed and CW light are the same to within our experimental error, which is on the order of $10^{-12}$ of the optical frequency, and one part in 700 of the expected gravitational shift.

    "abstract": "           Optical two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is a powerful ultrafast spectroscopic technique that can greatly benefit from the unique features of a femtosecond laser operating at a kHz repetition rate. However, isolating specific nonlinear signal in the collinear geometry, especially with a kHz laser, presents challenges. We present an experimental implementation of optical 2DCS in a collinear geometry using a femtosecond laser operating at a 5 KHz repetition rate. The desired nonlinear signal is selectively extracted in the frequency domain by lock-in detection. Both pump-probe and optical 2DCS experiments were conducted on a rubidium vapor. The signal-to-noise ratio of pump-probe and 2DCS spectra was characterised under various experimental parameters. The study highlights the importance of the lock-in reference frequency in overcoming the limitations imposed by low repetition rates, thereby paving the way for the application of collinear optical 2DCS in material systems requiring kHz femtosecond lasers.

Recent advances in high performance optical microcombs provide compact and powerful multiwavelength sources for MWP transversal filters that require a larger number of wavelength channels to achieve high performance, allowing for the demonstration of a diverse range of filter functions with improved performance and new features. Here, we present a comprehensive performance analysis for microcomb based MWP spectral filters based on the transversal filter approach. First, we investigate the theoretical limitations in the filter spectral response induced by finite tap numbers. Next, we analyze the distortions in the filter spectral response resulting from experimental error sources. Finally, we assess the influence of input signals bandwidth on the filtering errors.

    "abstract": "           Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer ultra-broad optical bandwidths that enable unprecedented data throughputs for signal processing applications. Dynamic reconfigurability enables compensation of fabrication flaws and fluctuating external environments, tuning for adaptive equalization and training of optical neural networks. The initial step in PIC reconfiguration entails measuring its dynamic performance, often described by its frequency response. While measuring the amplitude response is straightforward, e.g. using a tunable laser and optical power meter, measuring the phase response presents challenges due to various factors, including phase variations in test connections and instrumentation limitations. To address these challenges, a universal and robust characterization technique is proposed, which uses an on-chip reference path coupled to the signal processing core (SPC), with a delay larger or smaller than the total delay across the signal processing paths. A Fourier transform of the chip's power response reveals the SPC's impulse response. The method is more robust against low reference-path power and imprecise delays. Experiments using a finite-impulse-response (FIR) structure demonstrate rapid SPC training, overcoming thermal crosstalk and device imperfections. This approach offers a promising solution for PIC characterization, facilitating expedited physical parameter training for advanced applications in communications and optical neural networks.

Haloscopes aim to detect axions in the galactic halo by measuring the photon signal resulting from axions interacting with a strong magnetic field. Existing haloscopes are primarily targeting axion masses which produce microwave-range photons and rely on microwave resonators to enhance the signal power. Only a limited subset of resonator modes are useful for this process, and current cylindrical-style cavities suffer from mode mixing and crowding from other fundamental modes. The majority of these modes can be eliminated by using photonic band gap (PBG) resonators. The band gap behavior of these structures allows for a resonator with mode selectivity based on frequency. We present results from the first tunable PBG resonator, a proof-of-concept design with a footprint compatible with axion haloscopes. We have thoroughly characterized the tuning range of two versions of the structure and report the successful confinement of the operating TM$_{010}$ mode and the elimination of all TE modes within the tuning range.

    "abstract": "           Excitation energy transfer is a photophysical process upon which many chemical and biological phenomena are built. From natural small systems to synthetic multichromophoric macromolecules, energy transfer deals with the process of migration of electronic excitation energy from an excited donor to an acceptor. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, the rapid evolution of quantum-enabled technologies has motivated the question on whether nonclassical sources of light, such as entangled photon pairs, may provide us with a better control (or enhancement) of energy transfer at the nanoscale. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the joint excitation of two non-interacting two-level atoms by time-frequency correlated photon pairs -- whose central frequencies are not resonant with the individual particles -- generated by means of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). We demonstrate that while strong frequency anti-correlation between photons guarantees a large two-photon excitation (TPE) probability, photons bearing a sine cardinal spectral shape exhibit a $\\sim$3.8 times larger TPE signal than photons with a Gaussian spectrum. More importantly, we find that suppression of time-ordered excitation pathways does not substantially modify the TPE probability for two-photon states with a Gaussian spectral shape; whereas photons with a sine cardinal spectrum exhibit the strongest TPE signals when two-photon excitation pathways are not suppressed. Our results not only help elucidating the role of time-frequency correlations in resonance energy transfer with SPDC photons, but also provide valuable information regarding the optimal source to be used in its experimental implementation.

Here, we discover that unexpectedly charge carrier density fluctuations give rise to a novel noise process in recently emerged electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate photonic integrated microresonators exhibit an unexpected Flicker type (i.e. $1/f^{1.2}$) scaling in their noise properties, significantly deviating from the well-established thermorefractive noise theory. We show that this noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson-Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for Pockels integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices, ranging from ultra-fast tunable and low-noise lasers, Pockels soliton microcombs, to quantum transduction, squeezed light or entangled photon-pair generation.

While conventional circular polarization has been well explored, the potential of counterrotating bicircular light remains widely underexplored, despite growing interest in theory. In the mid-infrared or multi-terahertz region, experimental challenges lie in difficulties in stabilizing the relative phase between two-color lights and the lack of available polarization elements. Here, we successfully generated phase-stable counterrotating bicircular light pulses in the 10-40 THz frequency range circumventing the above problems. Employing spectral broadening, polarization pulse shaping with a spatial light modulator, and intra-pulse difference frequency generation leveraging a distinctive angular-momentum selection rule within the nonlinear crystal, we achieved direct conversion from near-infrared pulses into the designed counterrotating bicircular multi-terahertz pulses. Use of the spatial light modulator enables programmable control over the shape, orientation, rotational symmetry, and helicity of the bicircular light field trajectory. This advancement provides a novel pathway for the programmable manipulation of light fields, and marks a significant step toward understanding and harnessing the impact of tailored light fields on matter, particularly in the context of topological semimetals.

    "title": "Integrated Triply Resonant Electro-Optic Frequency Comb in Lithium Tantalate",
    "abstract": "           Integrated frequency comb generators based on Kerr parametric oscillation have led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, LiDAR, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with >2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.         ",

    "title": "Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing",
    "abstract": "           Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, offer significant advantages in sensor design. However, the extreme sensitivity near EPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom to achieve controllable EPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.
