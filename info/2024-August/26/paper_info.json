    "abstract": "           We develop a novel method for strong-laser-field physics based on the combination of the semiclassical Herman-Kluk propagator and the strong-field approximation and demonstrate its high accuracy on the calculations of photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) for atoms and molecules in intense lasers. For rescattered electrons, we show that for a given time that electron tunnels to the continuum, there are typically multiple trajectories that lead to the same final momentum in the high-energy region. These trajectories start with slightly different initial transverse momenta and carry different phases giving rise to the interference structures in the PMD, which can also be associated with the laser-free electron-ion differential cross section. This is in contrast to the well-known long and short trajectories, which result in different interference patterns. Our results can be used to extend current capabilities of the laser-induced electron diffraction and other ultrafast imaging and strong-field spectroscopic techniques.         ",

The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) sustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation, reflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We derive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing frequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled relaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with the field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting potential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles with permanent dipoles.

An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect manifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with opposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent (Goos-Hanchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam polarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the mixing of polarization states are analyzed. High purity of spin separation and a high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal polarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The spineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with diagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.         ",

Lower optical losses also increase the cavity storage time and with the 123 meter long ALPS II RC we have demonstrated the longest storage time of a two-mirror optical cavity.

    "abstract": "           Engineering the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is fundamental to the design of quantum systems. Automating Hamiltonian design through gradient-based optimization can dramatically accelerate this process. However, computing the gradients of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian--a large, sparse matrix--relative to system properties poses a significant challenge, especially for arbitrary systems. Superconducting quantum circuits offer substantial flexibility in Hamiltonian design, making them an ideal platform for this task. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the gradient-based optimization of superconducting quantum circuits, leveraging the SQcircuit software package. By addressing the challenge of calculating the gradient of the eigensystem for large, sparse Hamiltonians and integrating automatic differentiation within SQcircuit, our framework enables efficient and precise computation of gradients for various circuit properties or custom-defined metrics, streamlining the optimization process. We apply this framework to the qubit discovery problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying qubit designs with superior performance metrics. The optimized circuits show improvements in a heuristic measure of gate count, upper bounds on gate speed, decoherence time, and resilience to noise and fabrication errors compared to existing qubits. While this methodology is showcased through qubit optimization and discovery, it is versatile and can be extended to tackle other optimization challenges in superconducting quantum hardware design.

For AMEGO-X AstroPix must maintain a power consumption of less than $1.5~\\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$ while having a pixel pitch of up to $500~\\rm{\\mu m}$. We developed the second and third versions of AstroPix, namely AstroPix2 and AstroPix3. AstroPix2 and AstroPix3 exhibit power consumptions of $3.4~\\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$ and $4.1~\\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, respectively. While AstroPix2 has a pixel pitch of $250~\\rm{\\mu m}$, AstroPix3 achieves the desired size for AMEGO-X with a pixel pitch of $500~\\rm{\\mu m}$. Performance evaluation of a single pixel in an AstroPix2 chip revealed a dynamic range from 13.9 keV to 59.5 keV, with the energy resolution meeting the AMEGO-X target value ($<10\\%$ (FWHM) at 60 keV). We performed energy calibration on most of the pixels in an AstroPix3 chip, yielding a mean energy resolution of 6.2 keV (FWHM) at 59.5 keV, with 44.4% of the pixels satisfying the target value. The dynamic range of AstroPix3 was assessed to span from 22.2 keV to 122.1 keV. The expansion of the depletion layer aligns with expectations in both AstroPix2 and AstroPix3. Furthermore, radiation tolerance testing was conducted on AstroPix. An AstroPix2 chip was subjected to an equivalent exposure of approximately 10 Gy from a high-intensity $\\rm{^{60}Co}$ source. The chip was fully operational after irradiation although a decrease in gain by approximately 4% was observed.         ",

We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.         ",

Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams.

Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.         ",

Terahertz (THz) phononic engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher temperatures. Despite its potential, methods for engineering THz phonons have been limited due to the challenges of achieving the required material control at sub-nanometer precision and efficient phonon coupling at THz frequencies. Here, we demonstrate efficient generation, detection, and manipulation of THz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We employ few-layer graphene (FLG) as an ultrabroadband phonon transducer, converting femtosecond near-infrared pulses to acoustic phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A monolayer WSe$_2$ is used as a sensor, where high-fidelity readout is enabled by the exciton-phonon coupling and strong light-matter interactions. Combining these capabilities in a single heterostructure and detecting responses to incident mechanical waves, we perform THz phononic spectroscopy. Using this platform, we demonstrate high-Q THz phononic cavities and show that a monolayer WSe$_2$ embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can efficiently block the transmission of THz phonons. By comparing our measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtain the force constants at the heterointerfaces.

Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities.
