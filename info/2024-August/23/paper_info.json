    "title": "Determining van der Waals materials' optical and polaritonic properties using cryogenic FTIR micro-spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "           Van-der-Waals materials have been shown to support numerous exotic polaritonic phenomena originating from their layered structures and associated vibrational and electronic properties. This includes emergent polaritonic phenomena, including hyperbolicity and exciton-polariton formation. However, many van-der-Waals materials' unique properties are most prominent at cryogenic temperatures. This presents a particular challenge for polaritonics research, as reliable optical constant data is required for understanding light-matter coupling. For infrared polaritonics (3-100um), the small size of exfoliated flakes makes conventional ellipsometry impossible. This paper presents a cryogenic Fourier transform infrared microscope design constructed entirely from off-the-shelf components and fitting procedures for determining optical constants. We use this microscope to present the first temperature-dependent characterization of the optical properties of hexagonal boron nitride grown with isotopically pure boron. We show that Fabry Perot-type resonances close to the transverse optical phonon show the key temperature-dependent tuning of several parameters. Our full analysis of the infrared dielectric function shows small but significant tuning of the optical constants, which is highly consistent with Raman data from the literature. We then use this dielectric data to perform and analyze the polariton propagation properties, which agree extremely well with published cryogenic scattering-type nearfield microscopy results. In addition to the insights gained into hyperbolic polaritons in hBN, our paper represents a transferable framework for characterizing exfoliated infrared polaritonic materials and other infrared devices. This could accelerate discoveries in other material systems, especially those that are spatially inhomogeneous or cannot be prepared as large single crystals.         ",

    "abstract": "           The field of computational chemistry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) potentials to predict molecular properties with high accuracy and efficiency, providing a viable alternative to traditional quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which are often computationally intensive. Central to the success of ML models is the quality and comprehensiveness of the data sets on which they are trained. Quantum chemistry data sets and databases, comprising extensive information on molecular structures, energies, forces, and other properties derived from QM calculations, are crucial for developing robust and generalizable ML potentials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of quantum chemical data sets and databases. We examine key characteristics and functionalities of prominent resources, including the types of information they store, the level of electronic structure theory employed, the diversity of chemical space covered, and the methodologies used for data creation. Additionally, an updatable resource is provided to track new data sets and databases at this https URL. Looking forward, we discuss the challenges associated with the rapid growth of quantum chemical data sets and databases, emphasizing the need for updatable and accessible resources to ensure the long-term utility of them. We also address the importance of data format standardization and the ongoing efforts to align with the FAIR principles to enhance data interoperability and reusability. Drawing inspiration from established materials databases, we advocate for the development of user-friendly and sustainable platforms for these data sets and databases.         ",

    "abstract": "           An optical vortex beam has attracted significant attention across diverse applications, including optical manipulation, phase-contrast microscopy, optical communication, and quantum photonics. To utilize vortex generators for integrated photonics, researchers have developed ultra-compact vortex generators using fork gratings, metasurfaces, and integrated microcombs. However, those devices depend on costly, time-consuming nanofabrication and are constrained by the low signal-to-noise ratio due to the fabrication error. As an alternative maneuver, spin-orbit coupling has emerged as a method to obtain the vortex beam by converting spin angular momentum (SAM) without nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an optical vortex beam using van der Waals (vdW) materials. The significantly high birefringence of vdW materials allows generations of optical vortex beams with high efficiency in a sub-wavelength thickness. In this work, we utilize an 8-um-thick hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystal for the creation of optical vortices carrying topological charges of +2 and -2. We also present the generation of an optical vortex beam in a 320-nm-thick MoS2 crystal with a conversion efficiency of 0.09. This study paves the way for fabrication-less and ultra-compact optical vortex generators, which can be applied for integrated photonics and large-scale vortex generator arrays.         ",

Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in attaining quantum-limited optical detection and control of a nanoscale particle by coupling its motion to a high-finesse optical cavity in the resolved-sideband regime. In order to control the particle deeper in the quantum regime, however, it is necessary to significantly enhance the coupling between the particle and the cavity. Here, we present a novel platform that can allow for achieving this. Our system consists of a conventional optical tweezer and a toroidal optical microcavity with an ultrahigh quality (Q) factor. The optomechanical coupling between the particle and the cavity is established by placing the particle in the near field of the cavity. The significantly reduced mode volume allows us to achieve a 100-fold increase in the single photon optomechanical coupling compared to a conventional Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity with macroscopic mirrors, while ultralow loss of the cavity maintains the system close to the resolved-sideband regime. Our approach paves the way for enabling quantum experiments on levitated mesoscopic particles with high quantum cooperativity near the resolved-sideband regime.         ",

Radiation damage in the form of bulk or substrate damage is dependent on the incident particle species and energy.

The hardness factor can be determined by analysing the change in the leakage current of silicon pad diodes post-irradiation. Using the MC40 cyclotron facility at the University of Birmingham, n-in-p FZ silicon pad diodes were irradiated to several fluence points at three different proton beam energies. The hardness factors acquired were 3.07 $\\pm$ 0.37 for 10.5 MeV protons, 2.73 $\\pm$ 0.27 for 16.4 MeV protons and 2.19 $\\pm$ 0.22 for 24.3 MeV protons.

One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.         ",

    "abstract": "           Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.         ",

In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.         ",

For 1D chains density matrix renormalization group calculations show that the competition between these interactions leads to six different phases. For weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and large antiferromagnetic interactions we find a symmetry protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase. This is equivalent to the Haldane-large-D phase transition driven by single ion anisotropy(D) in the spin-one Heisenberg model. For strong SOC the Sz=+-1 HS states are high-energy excitations. Thus, the system can be understood as a transverse field Ising model with the SOC playing the role of the transverse field. Consistent with this, we find a quantum phase transition between the THS phase and a quantum disordered (QD) phase. However, if the magnetic coupling is non-zero or the HS and LS states of a single molecule are non-degenerate the Z2 (Ising) symmetry is broken and the phase transition becomes a crossover. Thus, the QD phase and the THS phases are adiabatically connected, as, equivalently, are the large-D phase of the spin-one Heisenberg model and the quantum disordered phase of the transverse field Ising model. We also find a ferroelastic LS phase, and antierroelastic phase, with alternating HS and LS complexes, and a dimer phase, which results from the competition between antiferromagnetic and antiferroelastic interactions.

The MLA focuses the sampled wavefront onto an array of grating couplers that inject the beamlets into the single-mode waveguides of the corrector. The beams in each waveguide are then shifted in phase using thermo-optic phase shifters before combining the co-phased beams into one single-mode waveguide. In this work, we analyze the external factors that we anticipate will impact the performance of the corrector.

Here we theoretically propose an experimentally viable method to directly detect the topological winding number of one-dimensional chiral photonic lattices. The method we propose is a generalization of the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context with coherent illumination. By integrating the mean-chiral displacement of the steady state over the pump light frequency, one can obtain the winding number with a correction of the order of the loss rate squared.

In this work, we present a novel approach that leverages pixel-level control of PCM in inverse-designed photonic devices, enabling highly reconfigurable, multi-functional operations. We integrate low-loss Sb2Se3 onto a multi-mode interferometer (MMI) and achieve precise, localized phase manipulation through direct laser writing. This technique allows for flexible programming of the photonic device by adjusting the PCM phase pattern rather than relying on global phase states, thereby enhancing device adaptability. As a proof of concept, we programmed the device as a wavelength-division multiplexer and subsequently reconfigured it into a mode-division multiplexer. Our results underscore the potential of combining inverse design with pixel-wise tuning for next-generation programmable phase-change photonic systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.         ",

    "title": "Edge-dependent anomalous topology in synthetic photonic lattices subject to discrete step walks",
    "abstract": "           Anomalous topological phases, where edge states coexist with topologically trivial Chern bands, can only appear in periodically driven lattices. When the driving is smooth and continuous, the bulk-edge correspondence is guaranteed by the existence of a bulk invariant known as the winding number. However, in lattices subject to periodic discrete-step walks the existence of edge states does not only depend on bulk invariants but also on the boundary. This is a consequence of the absence of an intrinsic time-dependence or micromotion in discrete-step walks. We report the observation of edge states and a simultaneous measurement of the bulk invariants in anomalous topological phases in a two-dimensional synthetic photonic lattice subject to discrete-step walks. The lattice is implemented using time multiplexing of light pulses in two coupled fibre rings, in which one of the dimensions displays real space dynamics and the other one is parametric. The presence of edge states is inherent to the periodic driving and depends on the properties of the boundary in the implemented two-band model with zero Chern number. We provide a suitable expression for the topological invariants whose calculation does not rely on micromotion dynamics.         ",

    "title": "High-performance multiqubit system with double-transmon couplers: Toward scalable superconducting quantum computers",
    "abstract": "           Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 99% in various architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and individual and simultaneous 10-ns $\\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities over 99.99%. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers.         ",

    "title": "Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues",
    "abstract": "           The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.
