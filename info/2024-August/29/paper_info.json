    "abstract": "           We investigate the role of hyperfine structure in resonant-dipole interactions between two atoms co-trapped in an optical tweezer. Two-body loss rates from light-assisted collisions (LACs) are measured across the $^{87}$Rb hyperfine spectrum and connected to properties of molecular photoassociation potentials via a semi-classical model. To obtain our results, we introduce an imaging technique that leverages repulsive LACs to detect two atoms in a trap, thereby circumventing parity constraints in tweezers. Our findings offer key insights for exploiting hyperfine structure in laser-induced collisions to control cold atoms and molecules in a broad range of quantum science applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Clarifying the contribution of various atoms and structural units formed in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials to macroscopic optical response is crucial for NLO crystal design. In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly to the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.         ",

    "abstract": "           A primary challenge in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is to achieve efficient and stable power transmission without complex control strategies when load conditions change dynamically. Addressing this issue, we propose a third-order pseudo-Hermitian WPT system whose output characteristics exhibit a stable frequency and constant power. The frequency selection mechanism and energy efficiency of the nonlinear WPT system based on pseudo-Hermitian under the coupling mode theory approximation are analyzed. Theoretical analysis indicates that under certain coupling coefficients and load conditions, the proposed system can achieve frequency adaptation in a stable frequency mode without the need to change the circuit frequency. When the load changes dynamically, the stability of the power output is maintained using a proportional integral (PI) control strategy that only collects the voltage and current at the transmitting end, eliminating the need for wireless communication circuits with feedback from the receiving side. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design scheme can achieve constant power transmission when load conditions change, maintaining stable and relatively high transmission efficiency. The proposed scheme exhibits benefits in practical applications since no communication is required.         ",

A promising approach to quantum microwave-optics transduction uses an intermediary mechanical mode along with piezo-optomechanical interactions. So far, such transducers have been released from their underlying substrate to confine mechanical fields -- preventing proper thermal anchoring and creating a noise-efficiency trade-off resulting from optical absorption. Here, we introduce a release-free, i.e. non-suspended, piezo-optomechanical transducer intended to circumvent this noise-efficiency trade-off. We propose and design a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) release-free transducer with appealing piezo- and optomechanical performance. Our proposal integrates release-free lithium niobate electromechanical crystals with silicon optomechanical crystals on a sapphire substrate meant to improve thermal anchoring along with microwave and mechanical coherence. It leverages high-wavevector mechanical modes firmly guided on the chip surface. Beyond quantum science and engineering, the proposed platform and design principles are attractive for low-power acousto-optic systems in integrated photonics.         ",

    "abstract": "           The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.         ",

Here, we unveil reversible symmetry changes in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural modeling and first-principles calculations, we reveal that symmetry-broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off-centering for about 100 ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties as shown by transient optical measurements. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.

Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.

Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity.

First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.         ",

This paper proposes an approach to extending the functionality of a standard magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by introducing an additional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (FM/AFM) storage layer (SL) vertically integrated with the standard Vortex MTJ stack into the nanopillar. The magnetostatic field created by this storage layer acts on the free layer and can be used to change its static and dynamic properties. To tune the magnitude and direction of this magnetostatic field, magnetic reconfiguration is carried out through a thermally assisted switching mechanism using a voltage pulse that heats the AFM layer in the SL above the Neel temperature in the presence of an external field. It is experimentally shown that using an MTJ based on a 600 nm diameter nanopillar with a vortex in the free layer, reconfiguration of the SL allows to continuously change the core precession frequency in the 15 MHz range. The reconfigurable analogue storage layer locally affects both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ free layer, demonstrating vertical 3D integration of additional functionalities into a single MTJ nanopillar.

Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields (B<500mT). For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.

We will start from experimentally based evidence in order to analyse and explain physical facts, moving cautiously from a classical to a quantum description, without mixing them up. The overall picture will be that the physical properties of microscopic systems are quantized, as initially shown by Planck and Einstein, and they are also contextual, i.e. that they can be given a physical sense only by embedding a microscopic system within a macroscopic measurement context.

The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.         ",

    "title": "Optimal Tree Tensor Network Operators for Tensor Network Simulations: Applications to Open Quantum Systems",
    "abstract": "           Tree tensor network states (TTNS) decompose the system wavefunction to the product of low-rank tensors based on the tree topology, serving as the foundation of the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via thermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.         ",
