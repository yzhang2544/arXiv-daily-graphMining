    "abstract": "           Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33 \\pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.

    "abstract": "           Recent experimental and theoretical results have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons in the MeV range by focusing tightly a few-cycle laser beam in ambient air. Using Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, this configuration is revisited within a more accurate modelling approach to analyze and optimize the mechanism responsible for electron acceleration. In particular, an analytical model for a linearly polarized tightly-focused ultrashort laser field is derived and coupled to a PIC code, allowing us to model the interaction of laser beams reflected by high-numerical aperture mirrors with laser-induced plasmas. A set of 3D PIC simulations is performed where the laser wavelength is varied from 800 nm to 7.0 $\\mu$m while the normalized amplitude of the electric field is varied from $a_{0} = 3.6$ to $a_{0} = 7.0$. The preferential forward acceleration of electrons, as well as the analysis of the laser intensity evolution in the plasma and data on electron number density, confirm that the relativistic ponderomotive force is responsible for the acceleration. We also demonstrate that the electron kinetic energy reaches a maximum of $\\approx1.6$ MeV when the central wavelength is of 2.5 $\\mu$m.         ",

The vortex solitons, composed by three waves ($\\omega_{1,2,3}$) propagating through the lattices, exhibit a four-spotted discrete type, which gives rise to four distinct modes: zero-vorticity, vortex, anti-vortex, and quadrupole. The composite vortex solitons result from combinations of these modes and lead to four cases: vortex doubling, hidden vortices, vortex up-conversion, and anti-vortex up-conversion. Our findings indicate that all solitons can propagate stably through the crystals for 10 centimeters; however, only the vortex-doubling case remains stable over longer distances.

    "abstract": "           Coherent detection can provide enhanced receiver sensitivity and spectral efficiency in free-space optical (FSO) communications. However, turbulence can cause modal power coupling effects on a Gaussian data beam and significantly degrade the mixing efficiency between the data beam and a Gaussian local oscillator (LO) in the coherent detector. Optical phase conjugation (OPC) in a photorefractive crystal can \"automatically\" mitigate turbulence by: (a) recording a back-propagated turbulence-distorted probe beam, and (b) creating a phase-conjugate beam that has the inverse phase distortion of the medium as the transmitted data beam. However, previously reported crystal-based OPC approaches for FSO links have demonstrated either: (i) a relatively fast response time of 35 ms but at a relatively low data rate (e.g., <1 Mbit/s), or (ii) a relatively high data rate of 2-Gbit/s but at a slow response time (e.g., >60 s). Here, we report an OPC approach for the automatic mitigation of dynamic turbulence that enables both a high data rate (8 Gbit/s) data beam and a rapid (<5 ms) response time. For a similar data rate, this represents a 10,000-fold faster response time than previous reports, thereby enabling mitigation for dynamic effects. In our approach, the transmitted pre-distorted phase-conjugate data beam is generated by four-wave mixing in a GaAs crystal of three input beams: a turbulence-distorted probe beam, a Gaussian reference beam regenerated from the probe beam, and a Gaussian data beam carrying a high-speed data channel. We experimentally demonstrate our approach in an 8-Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keying coherent FSO link through emulated dynamic turbulence. Our results show ~10-dB improvement in the mixing efficiency of the LO with the data beam under dynamic turbulence with a bandwidth of up to ~260 Hz (Greenwood frequency).         ",

This Letter demonstrates bi-directional asymmetric frequency conversion -- either upward or downward -- depending on the excitation direction in the elastic domain, moving beyond uni-directional approaches. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate its practical realization in a model system of cylindrical beam crystals, a type of granular crystal characterized by intrinsic local resonance. This novel wave transport mechanism operates through the interplay of nonlinear contact, spatial asymmetry, and the coupling of local resonance. Thanks to the proposed highly tunable architecture, we demonstrate various ways to manipulate wave transport, including tunable frequency conversion. Given that the local resonance we employ exemplifies avoided crossings (i.e., a strong coupling effect), our work may inspire investigations into diverse physical nonlinear domains that support material/structural resonance.

We show that a pair of coupled semiconductor ring lasers spontaneously forms a frequency comb consisting of the hybridized modes of its coupled cavity, exhibiting a large number of phase-locked tones that anticross with one another. Experimental coherent waveform reconstruction reveals that the hybridized frequency comb manifests itself as pairs of bright and dark picosecond-long solitons circulating simultaneously. The dark and bright solitons exit the coupled cavity at the same time, leading to breathing bright solitons temporally overlapped with their dark soliton counterparts - a state inaccessible for a single, free-running laser.

Traditionally, a classical pair collision picture was used to calculate the Coulomb logarithm for different plasma parameters. With the recent emergence of the high interest in dense plasmas with partially degenerate electrons, new approaches have been developed to treat electron-ion collisions in a quantum-mechanical way. In this context, gaining a deeper physical understanding of the criteria for the applicability of classical plasma models is crucial. We have analyzed the Coulomb logarithm describing the electron-ion collisions in hydrogen plasmas in a wide range of temperatures and densities relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The electron-ion collision cross-sections were computed using both quantum and classical scattering theories. We found that the classical description of the electron-ion scattering in plasmas and related plasma models is applicable if the de Broglie wavelength of electrons is smaller than the ion charge screening length in plasmas. Additionally, we show that the quantum first-order Born approximation for describing the electron-ion collision is accurate only in the regime where classical scattering theory is accurate.

We show that the previously identified cubic centre (Er-C) has C2v or lower symmetry. Using crystal field analysis of Er-C and other Er centres, and by comparison with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, we show that Er centres can be arranged in a sequence, ranging from entirely Si coordinated, through mixed Si and oxygen (O) coordination, to entirely O coordinated. G-factors calculated from our crystal field fitting closely match those determined by Zeeman splitting and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. We co-implanted Si with Er and O (each to a concentration of 1019 cm-3). By increasing the quenching rate of the subsequent thermal anneal from ~100 \u00b0C/s to ~1000 \u00b0C/s, we change the dominant optically active centre, formed from Er2O3 clusters to the less energetically favourable Er-C centre with mixed Si and O coordination. Temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) shows that Er2O3 clusters and Er-C centres have an O-related defect state at ~200 and 90 meV above the 4I13/2 Er manifold, respectively. PL lifetime measurements show that the Er2O3 clusters and Er-C centres fall into two or three classes, characterised by different non-radiative PL decay rates. Our high quench rate annealing process could facilitate the formation of a single, optically active Er centre, which is preferable for quantum networking applications of Er:Si.         ",

Existing works have pushed each technique to its individual limits. For example, the polarization multiplexing channels working at a single wavelength have been significantly increased by using noise engineering. However, it is still challenging to achieve the multiplexing limits of wavelength and polarization simultaneously. Besides, such multiplexing methods suffer from computational inefficiencies, hindering their application in tasks like image recognition that require extensive training computation. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using deep neural network (DNN) to achieve the limits of both polarization and wavelength multiplexing with high computational efficiency. We experimentally demonstrate this capability, achieving a record-breaking capacity of 15 holographic images across five wavelengths and the maximum of three independent polarization channels, as well as 18 holographic images across three wavelengths and six corelated polarization channels. Moreover, leveraging the high computational efficiency of our DNN-based method, which is well-suited for processing large datasets, we implement large-scale image recognition tasks across 36 classes encoded in a record of nine multiplexed channels (three wavelengths * three polarizations), achieving 96% classification accuracy in calculations and 91.5% in experiments.

In this study, we investigate a vision-based method based on the Gunnar-Farneback optical flow to extract SCG signals from the chest skin movements recorded by a smartphone camera. We compared the SCG signals extracted from the chest videos of four healthy subjects with those obtained from accelerometers and our previous method based on sticker tracking. Our results demonstrated that the vision-based SCG signals extracted by the proposed method closely resembled those from accelerometers and stickers, although these signals were captured from slightly different locations. The mean squared error between the vision-based SCG signals and accelerometer-based signals was found to be within a reasonable range, especially between signals on head-to-foot direction (0.2$<$MSE$<$1.5). Additionally, heart rates derived from the vision-based SCG exhibited good agreement with the gold-standard ECG measurements, with a mean difference of 0.8 bpm. These results indicate the potential of this non-invasive method in health monitoring and diagnostics.         ",

By employing a carefully tuned complex frequency excitation method, we demonstrate the efficient conversion of non-oscillating fields into oscillating ones. This effect is shown in both RF and optical domains, specifically within the C-band infrared spectral range, which is crucial for communications. This study enhances the theoretical framework of wave interactions in photonic systems, paving the way for innovative applications in invisibility cloaking, advanced photonic devices, and the future of optical communication and quantum computing.

    "abstract": "           Terahertz (THz) fiber that provides high-speed connections is an essential component in THz communication systems. The emerging space-division-multiplexing technology is expected to increase the transmission capacity of THz communications. A promising candidate to achieve that is integrating multiple channels in a compact THz multi-core fiber system. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a THz subwavelength rectangular dielectric dual-core fiber structure, where two identical cores can be densely integrated, thanks to the polarization-maintaining feature of the rectangular fiber. Different configurations, including the placements, core-spacings, and polarization states of two fiber cores, are comprehensively investigated to improve channel isolation. Numerical simulations show that the fractional power in core of fiber mode has a dominant effect on inter-core coupling performance. Moreover, we design the core size (1 mm x 0.5 mm) slightly less than the WR5.1 waveguide (1.295 mm x 0.6475 mm) so that the fiber can be conveniently connected with the WR5.1 flange port with mode excitation efficiencies up to 62.8%. A cost-efficient dielectric 3D printing technique is employed for rapid fabrications of dual-core fibers and corresponding polymer flange structures that offer solid integration between the fiber samples and the WR5.1 port. Experimental measurements demonstrate that a 4-mm core-spacing (less than three times the operation wavelengths over 0.17-0.21 THz) supports robust dual-channel propagation with channel isolation values more than 15 dB, which are consistent with theoretical and numerical results. This work provides a densely integrated dual-core fiber system with low fabrication cost and practical connection to the WR5.1 flange, holding exciting potential for high-capacity THz space-division-multiplexing communication systems.

Rydberg atom sensor has rapidly developed in recent years, capitalizing on its calibration-free SI-traceability, large polarizabilities and transition dipole moments. A Rydberg atom sensor is capable of sensitively detecting electric field signals from DC to THz. In this work, we demonstrate low frequency communication using Rydberg atoms in a vapor cell with two parallel electrode plates inside. Three modulations, BPSK, OOK, and 2FSK, are used for the communication by Rydberg atom receiver near 100kHz. We have measured the SNR of the modulated low frequency signal received by Rydberg atoms at various emission voltages. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated IQ constellation diagram, EVM and eye diagram of the demodulated signal at different symbol rate. The EVM is measured to be 8.8% when the symbol rate is 2Kbps, 9.4% when the symbol rate is 4Kbps, and 13.7% when the symbol rate is 8Kbps. The high-fidelity digital color image transmission resulted in a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 70dB.

However, essentially all experimental optical trapping studies in the optical dipole regime have, to date, been dominated by the interaction between a material's electric polarizability, $\\alpha_{e}$, and the electric part of the incident electromagnetic field, and therefore described by electric field intensity gradient forces. Optical trapping based on optical magnetic light-matter interactions has not been experimentally addressed despite it's immediate extension of the boundaries of optical trapping research and applications. This paper addresses this long-standing deficiency through the realization of optical magnetic trapping of large index of refraction (i.e., Si) nanoparticles and also presents a formalism for quantitative understanding of the experimental findings. Our experimental optical trapping results require including optical magnetic polarizability, $\\alpha_{m}$, and electric-magnetic scattering forces associated with the Photonic Hall effect that are qualitatively and quantitatively validated by Maxwell stress tensor calculations. Our findings bring new opportunities for nanoparticle manipulation, potentially relax the limitations Ashkin claimed based on the optical Earnshaw's theorem, motivate optical matter formation by optical magnetic interactions, and suggest new N-body effects and symmetry breaking to drive dynamics of optical matter systems.

The phenomenon of irreversible energy transfer from a linear primary system to a nonlinear absorber has driven great attention to the optimal design of vibration absorbers both for stationary and transient regimes. Recently, the same principle has also been targeted in acoustics for the absorption of sound waves at high excitation amplitudes. Meanwhile, acoustic absorption by electro-active means has found great success for noise reduction in the linear regime. This study uses a method allowing the design of nonlinear resonators at amplitudes that typically induce linear behaviors. This research proposes an analytical study of the implementation of the duffing equation as a nonlinear electroacoustic resonator coupled to an acoustic mode of a tube.

Here, we introduce a new class of active metamaterial made from dual-state unit cells, either vibration sources when powered or passive resonators when left disconnected. They possess self-tuning capabilities, enabling deep subwavelength band gaps to automatically match the carrier signal of powered cells, typically around 200Hz. Swift electronic commutations between both states establish the basis for real-time reconfiguration of waveguides and shaping of vibration patterns.

In this paper, we study the thermal emission properties of functionalized aluminum surfaces produced through femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). These types of surfaces have recently been found to exhibit near-unity broadband omnidirectional emissivity. However, their ultrabroadband absorption response includes visible and near-infrared (IR) radiation, in addition to the mid-IR range, which limits their use as daytime passive radiative cooling devices. Here, we present ways to solve this problem by demonstrating a new design that uses a dielectric Bragg visible light reflector to accurately control the thermal emission spectra of the FLSP surface with the goal of achieving high performance daytime radiative cooling operation. In addition, we propose other designs based on dielectric multilayer structures to further tailor and control the spectra and thermal emission angles of the FLSP surfaces leading to narrowband and broadband directional thermal radiation. The presented photonic engineering approach combined with FLSP structures will be beneficial to various emerging applications, such as radiative cooling, thermal sensing, and thermophotovoltaics.

In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.         ",

We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on $\\textit{local}$ error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the 2D classical Ising model and 4D toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared to a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a sub-threshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory.

How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction.

We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.

Cold atom is one of the most prominent platforms for quantum computing and precision measurement. However, LZRO has never been observed in cold atoms due to its stringent requirements. By compensating for the linear drift of the clock laser and optimizing experimental parameters, we successfully measured LZRO on the strontium atomic optical clock platform under both fast and slow passage limits within $4$ to $6$ driving periods. Compared to previous results on other platforms, the duration of the plateau is $10^4$ times longer in the optical lattice clock.

    "abstract": "           Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.         ",

Large energy spacings in $^{171}\\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are advantageous for spin-state preparations of quantum memory and construction of a transducer, thereby promoting the simultaneous stable control of the optical frequencies of lasers over a wide range of 3 GHz. We also built our own 2.7-K cryogenic system for optical, radio-wave-assisted spectroscopy. We attained to high resolution and sensitivity both in pump-probe saturation spectroscopy (PPS) and Raman heterodyne spectroscopy (RHS). Our frequency-stabilized PPS achieved a high-resolution spectrum of the HFS, whereas our setup of RHS enabled the efficient detection of paramagnetic spin resonance efficiently for a wide range of radio frequencies. As the underlying Raman process is an up-converting transduction, we present the optimization of the sensitivity of Raman heterodyne detections by selecting the best crystal orientation and efficient radio-wave coupling in future applications toward photon transducers.

    "abstract": "           An optical vortex beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere encounters distortions in the wavefront that results in modal scattering. Abruptly autofocussing (AAF) beams with orbital angular momentum have gained significant attention due to their non-diffracting and self-healing nature. These warrants understanding of the behaviour of these beams through turbulent atmosphere absolutely necessary. With this intuition, in the present work we investigate the behaviour of two AAF beams namely ring Airy vortex beam (RAVB) and ring Pearcey vortex beam (RPVB) through the turbulent atmosphere in two cases-multiplexed and non-multiplexed. We propagate multiplexed as well as non-multiplexed RAVB and RPVB in different levels of turbulent atmosphere. In non-multiplexed case, channel efficiency declines for both the beams with increase in modes numbers. In multiplexed case, increasing the gap between the mode sets results in decrease in channel efficiency. We also report that in weak atmospheric turbulence RAVB outperform RPVB in terms of channel efficiency. We use optical transformation sorting (log-polar) method to demultiplex the optical beams at the output. Furthermore, we investigate and compare the OAM spectra of both beams in different levels of atmospheric turbulence and at different propagation distances. The comparison reveals that the spectra of RPVB are more dispersive as compared to that of RAVB.         ",

Polaritons arise from the strong coupling of a dipole-allowed molecular transition with the photonic mode of an optical cavity. There is mounting evidence of modified reactivity under polaritonic conditions; however, the complex condensed-phase environment of most experimental demonstrations impedes mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon. While the gas phase was the playground of early efforts in atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics, we have only recently demonstrated the formation of molecular polaritons under these conditions. Studying the reactivity of isolated gas-phase molecules under strong coupling would eliminate solvent interactions and enable quantum state resolution of reaction progress. In this Perspective, we contextualize recent gas-phase efforts in the field of polariton chemistry and offer a practical guide for experiment design moving forward.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Microwave SQUID Multiplexer ({\\mu}MUX) is the device of choice for the readout of a large number of Low-Temperature Detectors in a wide variety of experiments within the fields of astronomy and particle physics. While it offers large multiplexing factors, the system noise performance is highly dependent on the cold and warm-readout electronic systems used to read it out, as well as the demodulation domain and parameters chosen. In order to understand the impact of the readout systems in the overall detection system noise performance, first we extended the available {\\mu}MUX simulation frameworks including additive and multiplicative noise sources in the probing tones (i.e. phase and amplitude noise), along with the capability of demodulating the scientific data, either in resonator's phase or scattering amplitude. Then, considering the additive noise as a dominant noise source, the optimum readout parameters to achieve minimum system noise were found for both open-loop and flux-ramp demodulation schemes in the aforementioned domains. Later, we evaluated the system noise sensitivity to multiplicative noise sources under the optimum readout parameters. Finally, as a case study, we evaluated the optimal demodulation domain and expected system noise level for a typical Software-Defined Radio (SDR) readout system. This work leads to an improved system performance prediction and noise engineering based on the available readout electronics and selected demodulation domain.         ",

Here we propose to break the half-cycle limit via inverse Compton scattering in a nano-slit optical mode, in which a deep-subwavelength-confined optical field can be converted into a deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse by high-energy free electrons flying through. Our calculations show that, with experimentally reachable conditions, a measurable deep-sub-cycle attosecond pulse with a width narrower than half an optical cycle can be generated. Quantitatively, using a deep-subwavelength-confined 4.4-$\\mu$m-wavelength 100-fs pulsed optical driving field and a 2-MeV 50-as 5-pC electron bunch, we can obtain an attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of 2.55 PHz, a pulse width of 99 as ($\\sim$0.25 optical cycle), and a single-pulse photon number larger than 200 around the material damage threshold. Such pulses may open opportunities for studying light-matter interaction on the deep-sub-cycle level, and pave a way to unprecedented optical technology ranging from temporal super-resolution optical microscopy and spectroscopy to unconventional atom/molecule polarization and manipulation.

Indeed, with the notable exception of a few special cases, their associated Schrodinger equation cannot be solved analytically for more than two particles. One has to resort to approximation methods to tackle quantum few-body problems. In particular, variational methods have been proposed to ease numerical calculations and obtain precise solutions. One such method is the Stochastic Variational Method, which employs a stochastic search to determine the number and parameters of correlated Gaussian basis functions used to construct an ansatz of the wave function. Stochastic methods, however, face numerical and optimization challenges as the number of particles increases. We introduce a family of gradient variational methods that replace stochastic search with gradient optimization. We comparatively and empirically evaluate the performance of the baseline Stochastic Variational Method, several instances of the gradient variational method family, and some hybrid methods for selected few-body problems. We show that gradient and hybrid methods can be more efficient and effective than the Stochastic Variational Method. We discuss the role of singularities, oscillations, and gradient optimization strategies in the performance of the respective methods.         ",

This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons.

Rayleigh criterion normally limits it: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show that putting the dielectric in motion (or time-modulating it) can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. The vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. Hence, certain susceptibility features can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric. This effect pertains to the far-field domain for (i), and to the near-field (but possibly long-range) domain for (ii). When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced for (i) and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit in the far-field domain.         ",

A prominent model for band topology is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which reveals topological in-gap states within Bragg-type gaps (BG) formed by periodic modification. Apart from classical BGs, another mechanism for bandgap formation in metamaterials involves strong coupling between local resonances and propagating waves, resulting in a local resonance-induced bandgap (LRG). Previous studies have shown the challenge of topological edge state emergence within the LRG. Here, we reveal that topological edge states can emerge within an LRG by achieving both topological phase and bandgap transitions simultaneously. We describe this using a model of inversion-symmetric extended SSH chains for locally resonant metamaterials. Notably, this topological state can lead to highly localized modes, comparable to a subwavelength unit cell, when it emerges within the LRG. We experimentally demonstrate distinct differences in topologically protected modes -- highlighted by wave localization -- between the BG and the LRG using locally resonant granule-based metamaterials. Our findings suggest the scope of topological metamaterials may be extended via their bandgap nature.         ",

We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation.
