    "abstract": "           Quantum Candies or Qandies provide us with a lucid way of understanding the concepts of quantum information and quantum science in the language of candies. The critical idea of qandies is intuitively depicting quantum science to the general public, making sense as most of the research in this domain is funded by the taxpayers. The qandies model is already used to explain the essential concepts of quantum science and quantum cryptography. However, teleportation and related concepts are yet to be explained. Motivated by this fact, we investigate and extend the idea of Jacobs and Lin-Mor-Shapira to explain teleportation using qandies. Here, we explicitly design the teleportation protocol and perform a circuit model using qandy gates. The protocol is successful when the correlated qandies are appropriately pre-shared and use of some local operations at both ends. The model we develop can be a valuable tool for science and engineering educators who want to help the general public to gain more insights into quantum science and technology.         ",

    "title": "Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models",
    "abstract": "           Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.         ",

    "abstract": "           In optoelectronics, designing free-form metasurfaces presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving high electromagnetic response fidelity due to the complex relationship between physical structures and electromagnetic behaviors. A key difficulty arises from the one-to-many mapping dilemma, where multiple distinct physical structures can yield similar electromagnetic responses, complicating the design process. This paper introduces a novel generative framework, the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), which prioritizes electromagnetic fidelity while effectively navigating the one-to-many challenge to create structurally diverse metasurfaces. Unlike existing methods that mainly replicate physical appearances, AcGAN excels in generating a variety of structures that, despite their differences in physical attributes, exhibit similar electromagnetic responses, thereby accommodating fabrication constraints and tolerances. We introduce the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) as a precise metric to measure the spectral fidelity between generated designs and their targets. Additionally, a cluster-guided controller refines input processing, ensuring multi-level spectral integration and enhancing electromagnetic fidelity. The integration of AnchorNet into our loss function facilitates a nuanced assessment of electromagnetic qualities, supported by a dynamic loss weighting strategy that optimizes spectral alignment. Collectively, these innovations represent a transformative stride in metasurface inverse design, advancing electromagnetic response-oriented engineering and overcoming the complexities of the one-to-many mapping dilemma.Empirical evidence underscores AcGAN's effectiveness in streamlining the design process, achieving superior electromagnetic precision, and fostering a broad spectrum of design possibilities.

Although the wavelength of light can be used to encode holographic image channels, high-capacity wavelength-multiplexing holography has traditionally been achieved only through 3D volume holograms based on Bragg diffraction. We demonstrate ultranarrow-linewidth wavelength-vortex multiplexing holography in ultrathin metasurface holograms. By applying dispersion engineering to the elementary grating functions of a multiplexing hologram, we develop a sparse k-vector-filtering aperture array in momentum space that achieves sharp wavelength selectivity in conjunction with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only multiplexing holograms, we reconstruct up to 118 independent image channels from a single metasurface hologram, achieving an ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nm in the visible range. Finally, we apply the developed wavelength-vortex multiplexing metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, achieving unprecedented security with an information rate more than 2500 times higher than that of traditional visual cryptography schemes. Our results open exciting avenues for the use of metasurface holograms in various applications, including 3D displays, holographic encryption, beam shaping, LiDAR, microscopy, data storage, and optical artificial intelligence.

    "title": "Highly Sensitive Differential Microwave Sensor Using Enhanced Spiral Resonators for Precision Permittivity Measurement",
    "abstract": "           This paper presents a highly sensitive microwave sensor for dielectric sensing. One of the main disadvantages of microwave resonant-based sensors is cross-sensitivity originated by time-dependent uncontrolled environmental factors such as temperature that affect the material under test (MUT) behavior, leading to undesirable frequency shifts and, hence, lower accuracy. However, this work eliminates the unwanted errors using the differential measurement technique by comparing two transmission resonance frequencies during a unit test setup to measure the permittivity of MUT over time. The proposed structure comprises a spiral resonator with an extended horizontal microstrip line (EH-ML) coupled to a microstrip transmission line (MTL). Creating EH-ML within the structure comprises two primary contributions: enhanced sensitivity resulting from stronger fringing fields generated by increasing the effective area and improved resolution due to higher resonance frequencies caused by a lower total capacitive coupling effect. The proposed sensor is fabricated and tested using MUTs with a permittivity of less than 80 to verify the performance. In this regard, a frequency detection resolution (FDR) of 44MHz and a sensitivity of 0.85% are achieved at a maximum permittivity of 78.3. The results of theoretical analysis, simulation, and measurement are in relatively good agreement. Consequently, the proposed highly sensitive microwave sensor offers significant advantages, such as low complexity in design and fabrication. It also offers high resolution and precision in a wide range of permittivity, which can be an attractive candidate for dielectric sensing in health, chemical and agriculture applications.         ",

For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step. Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method optimizes the quantum resource required and makes it more appropriate for near-term quantum hardware.

    "title": "Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine",
    "abstract": "           We have developed a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime, which we describe as a thermodynamic system-bath model [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{160}, 234112 (2024)]. Based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of non-equilibrium extensive and intensive variables in time derivative form. This is made possible by incorporating the entropy production rate into the definitions of non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Unlike fluctuation theorem and stochastic thermodynamics theory, this theory does not require the assumption of a factorized initial condition and is valid in the full quantum regime where the system and bath are quantum mechanically entangled. Our results are numerically verified by simulating a thermostatic Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal processes and two thermostatic processes using the quantum hierarchical Fokker--Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that, from weak to strong system-bath interactions, the thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.         ",

    "title": "Long-range ballistic propagation of 80$\\%$-excitonic-fraction polaritons in a perovskite metasurface at room temperature",
    "abstract": "           Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter elementary excitations arising from the strong coupling regime between excitons in semiconductors and photons in photonic nanostructures, offer a fruitful playground to explore the physics of quantum fluids of light as well as to develop all-optical devices. However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.         ",

    "title": "Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis",
    "abstract": "           Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.
