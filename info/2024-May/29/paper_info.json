    "abstract": "           Dispersion management of few-cycle pulses is crucial for ultrafast optics and photonics. Often, nontrivial dispersion is compensated using complex optical systems or minimized through careful design of waveguides. Here, we present dispersion-managed adiabatic frequency conversion enabling efficient downconversion of an 11.1-fs near-IR pulse to an 11.6-fs mid-IR pulse spanning an octave of bandwidth from 2-4 $\\mu$m. The adiabatic frequency converter is designed to impart a constant group delay over the entire bandwidth, eliminating the need for complex dispersion management and opening a new avenue for dispersion engineering in ultrafast optics and photonics. Notably, dispersion engineering through the position-dependent conversion position of an adiabatic conversion device constitutes an additional mechanism for dispersion control in ultrafast optics and photonics while maintaining high conversion efficiency for broadband pulses.

    "abstract": "           Low-intensity light beams carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), commonly known as vortex beams, have garnered significant attention due to promising applications in areas ranging from optical trapping to communication. In recent years, there has been a surge in global research exploring the potential of high-intensity vortex laser beams and specifically their interactions with plasmas. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in this area. Compared to conventional laser beams, intense vortex beams exhibit unique properties such as twisted phase fronts, OAM delivery, hollow intensity distribution, and spatially isolated longitudinal fields. These distinct characteristics give rise to a multitude of rich phenomena, profoundly influencing laser-plasma interactions and offering diverse applications. The paper also discusses future prospects and identifies promising general research areas involving vortex beams. These areas include low-divergence particle acceleration, instability suppression, high-energy photon delivery with OAM, and the generation of strong magnetic fields. With growing scientific interest and application potential, the study of intense vortex lasers is poised for rapid development in the coming years.         ",

Polarization multiplexing exploits the fast and slow axes of the fiber, while modelocking is achieved through a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror scheme using readily available components. The laser operates at a repetition rate of around 74.74 MHz with a tuning capability in the difference in repetition rates from 500 Hz to 200 kHz. This tunability makes the system more flexible for dual-comb spectroscopy experiments.

    "abstract": "           Biophotonic nanostructures in butterfly wing scales remain fascinating examples of biological functional materials, with intriguing open questions in regards to formation and evolutionary function. One particularly interesting butterfly species, Erora opisena (Lycaenidae: Theclinae), develops wing scales that contain three-dimensional photonic crystals that closely resemble a single gyroid geometry. Unlike most other gyroid forming butterflies, E. opisena develops discrete gyroid crystallites with a pronounced size gradient hinting at a developmental sequence frozen in time. Here, we use a hyperspectral (wavelength-resolved) microscopy technique to investigate the ultrastructural organisation of these gyroid crystallites in dry, adult wing scales. We show that reflectance corresponds to crystallite size, where larger crystallites reflect green wavelengths more intensely; this relationship could be used to infer size from the optical signal. We further successfully resolve the red-shifted reflectance signal from wing scales immersed in refractive index oils with varying refractive index, including values similar to water or cytosol. Such photonic crystals with lower refractive index contrast may be similar to the hypothesized nanostructural forms in the developing butterfly scales. The ability to resolve these fainter signals hints at the potential of this facile light microscopy method for in vivo analysis of nanostructure formation in developing butterflies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Various condensed phases of water, spanning from the liquid state to multiple ice phases, have been systematically investigated under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature to delineate their stability boundaries. This study focuses on probing the mechanical stability of liquid water through path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, employing the q-TIP4P/F potential to model interatomic interactions in flexible water molecules. Temperature and pressure conditions ranging from 250 to 375 K and -0.3 to 1 GPa, respectively, are considered. This comprehensive approach enables a thorough exploration of nuclear quantum effects on various physical properties of water through direct comparisons with classical molecular dynamics results employing the same potential model. Key properties such as molar volume, intramolecular bond length, H--O--H angle, internal and kinetic energy are analyzed, with a specific focus on the effect of tensile stress. Particular attention is devoted to the liquid-gas spinodal pressure, representing the limit of mechanical stability for the liquid phase, at several temperatures. The quantum simulations reveal a spinodal pressure for water of -286 and -236 MPa at temperatures of 250 and 300 K, respectively. At these temperatures, the discernible shifts induced by nuclear quantum motion are quantified at 15 and 10 MPa, respectively. These findings contribute valuable insights into the interplay of quantum effects on the stability of liquid water under diverse thermodynamic conditions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Terahertz (THz) imaging is one of the hotspots in the field of optics, where the depth information retrieval is a key factor to restore the three-dimensional appearance of objects. Impressive results for depth extraction in visible and infrared wave range have been demonstrated through deep learning (DL). Among them, most DL methods are merely data-driven, lacking relevant physical priors, which thus request for a large amount of experimental data to train the DL models.However, large training data acquirement in the THz domain is challenging due to the requirements of environmental and system stability, as well as the time-consuming data acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, this paper incorporates a complete physical model representing the THz image formation process into traditional DL networks to retrieve the depth information of objects. The most significant advantage is the ability to use it without pre-training, thereby eliminating the need for tens of thousands of labeled data. Through experiments validation, we demonstrate that by providing diffraction patterns of planar objects with their upper and lower halves individually masked, the proposed physics-informed neural network (NN) can automatically optimize and, ultimately, reconstruct the depth of the object through interaction between the NN and a physical model. The obtained results represent the initial steps towards achieving fast holographic THz imaging using reference-free beams and low-cost power detection.         ",

While vertical structures like nanopillars are ideal for this purpose, transducing their motion is challenging. Pillar-based photonic crystals (PhCs) offer a potential solution by integrating optical transduction within the pillars. However, achieving high-quality PhCs is hindered by inefficient vertical light confinement. Here, we present a full-silicon 1D photonic crystal cavity based on nanopillars as a new platform with great potential for applications in force sensing and biosensing areas. Its unit cell consists of a silicon pillar with larger diameter at its top portion than at the bottom, which allows vertical light confinement and an energy bandgap in the near infrared range for transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. We experimentally demonstrate optical cavities with Q-factors exceeding 1e3 constructed by inserting a defect within a periodic arrangement of this type of pillars. Given the fact that that each nanopillar naturally behaves as a nanomechanical cantilever, the fabricated geometries are excellent optomechanical (OM) photonic crystal cavities in which the mechanical motion of each nanopillar composing the cavity can be optically transduced. These novel geometries display enhanced mechanical properties, cost-effectiveness, integration possibilities, and scalability, and opens and new path in front of the widely used suspended Si beam OM cavities made on silicon-on-insulator.

Our results are described by non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials expressed in time-derivative form in terms of extensive and intensive variables. This is made possible through the incorporation of waste heat, which is equivalent to the loss work consumed by the bath, into the definitions of thermodynamic potentials in a non-equilibrium regime. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Our results are verified numerically by simulating a Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal and two thermostatic processes using the quantum Fokker-Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that any thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.         ",

The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.

We will present a conceptual design for the next generation laser driver of 10 MJ, 2~3 PW at the laser wavelength of 0.353 micrometer (or 0.353 micrometer, then the energy and power can be higher), and 1 shot per 30 minutes, which is efficient, compact, low-cost, low laser-plasma instabilities, applicable to multiple laser fusion schemes, and aiming for G > 30.

    "title": "A silicon photonics waveguide-coupled colloidal quantum dot photodiode sensitive beyond 1.6 um",
    "abstract": "           Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.

    "abstract": "           Two-photon atomic ionization driven by time-locked XUV and IR pulses allows to study dynamics of Fano resonances in time and energy domains. Different time evolution of the two interfering pathways leading to a Fano resonance can be exploited to turn the Fano profile of the two-photon XUV/IR ionization into a symmetric Gaussian once the directly ejected photoelectron leaves the parent ion and cannot any longer absorb an IR photon. This line shape transformation allows for the direct determination of the resonant lifetime from the spectroscopic measurements without need for an extremely fine energy resolution. Ubiquitous nature of Fano resonances makes this determination a universal tool in diverse quantum systems ranging from nuclei to nano-fabricated solids.         ",

    "title": "Intensity product-based optical sensing to beat the diffraction limit in an interferometer",
    "abstract": "           The classically defined minimum uncertainty of the optical phase is known as the standard quantum limit or shot-noise limit (SNL) originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase sensitivity is inversely proportional to the square root K, where K is the number of interfering photons or statistically measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous to enhance sensitivity due to the square root K gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In a typical interferometer, however, the resolution remains in the diffraction limit of the K=1 case unless the interfering photons are resolved as in quantum sensing. Here, a projection-measurement method in quantum sensing is adapted for an interferometer to achieve an additional square root K gain in resolution. For the projection measurement, the interference fringe of an interferometer can be Kth-powered to replace the Kth-order intensity product. To understand many-wave interference-caused enhanced resolution, several types of interferometers are numerically compared to draw corresponding resolution parameters. As a result, the achieved resolution by the Kth power to an N-slit interferometer exceeds the diffraction limit and the Heisenberg limit in quantum sensing.         ",
