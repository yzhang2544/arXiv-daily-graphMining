    "abstract": "           In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. From the resulting dimensions of the sensor after the illumination and projection system optimization, we affirm that it is compact and portable.         ",

However, the realization of arbitrarily tailoring a multitude of light field dimensions in complex media remains a challenge1, Through associating physical light fields and mathematical function spaces by introducing a mapping operator, we proposed a data-driven inverse design method to precisely manipulate between any two structured light fields in the on-chip high-dimensional Hilbert space. To illustrate, light field conversion in on-chip topological photonics was achieved. High-performance topological coupling devices with minimal insertion loss and customizable topological routing devices were designed and realized. Our method provides a new paradigm to enable precise manipulation over the on-chip vectorial structured light and paves the way for the realization of complex photonic functions.         ",

Such a device will require the combination of multiple material systems with different structures, bandgaps, and photoelectrical responses, which is extremely difficult to engineer using traditional epitaxial films. Here, we develop a multi-functional and high-performance photosensor using all van der Waals materials. The device features a gate-tunable spectral response that is switchable between near-infrared/visible and short-/mid-wave infrared, as well as broadband operation, at room temperature. The linear polarization sensitivity in the telecommunications O-band can also be directly modulated between horizontal, vertical, and nonpolarizing modes. These effects originate from the balance of photocurrent generation in two of the active layers that can be manipulated by an electric field. The photodetector features high detectivity (>109 cmHz1/2W-1) together with fast operation speed (~ 1 MHz) and can be further exploited for dual visible and infrared imaging.         ",

Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of AlScN EO micro-ring modulators, introducing active functionalities to the chip-scale AlScN platform. These waveguide-integrated EO modulators employ sputtered AlScN thin films as the light-guiding medium, and the entire fabrication process is compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. We characterize the high-frequency performance of an AlScN modulator for the first time, extracting a maximum in-device effective EO coefficient of 2.86 pm/V at 12 GHz. The devices show a minimum half-wave voltage-length product of 3.12 V*cm and a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of approximately 22 GHz.

    "abstract": "           We present the development of a new astrochemical research tool HILTRAC, the Highly Instrumented Low Temperature ReAction Chamber. The instrument is based on a pulsed form of the CRESU (Cin\u00e9tique de R\u00e9action en \u00c9coulement Supersonique Uniforme, meaning reaction kinetics in a uniform supersonic flow) apparatus, with the aim of collecting kinetics and spectroscopic information on gas phase chemical reactions important in interstellar space or planetary atmospheres. We discuss the apparatus design and its flexibility, the implementation of pulsed laser photolysis followed by laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF), and the first implementation of direct infrared frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) coupled to the uniform supersonic flow. Achievable flow temperatures range from 32(3) - 111(9) K, characterising a total of five Laval nozzles for use with N2 and Ar buffer gases by pressure impact measurements. These results were further validated using LIF and DFCS measurements of the CH radical and OCS, respectively. Spectroscopic constants and linelists for OCS are reported for the 1001 band near $2890 - 2940 cm^{-1}$ for both $OC^{32}S$ and $OC^{34}S$, measured using DFCS. Additional peaks in the spectrum are tentatively assigned to the OCS-Ar complex. The first reaction rate coefficients for the CH + OCS reaction measured between 32(3) K and 58(5) K are reported. The reaction rate coefficient at 32(3) K was measured to be $3.9(4) \\times 10^{10} cm^3 molecule^{-1} s^{-1}$ and the reaction was found to exhibit no observable temperature dependence over this low temperature range.

Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.         ",

Despite the advantages of PNN for inference, training remains a challenge. The imperfect information of the physical transformation means the failure of conventional gradient-based updates from backpropagation (BP). Here, we present the asymmetrical training (AT) method, which treats the PNN structure as a grey box. AT performs training while only knowing the last layer output and neuron topological connectivity of a deep neural network structure, not requiring information about the physical control-transformation mapping. We experimentally demonstrated the AT method on deep grey-box PNNs implemented by uncalibrated photonic integrated circuits (PICs), improving the classification accuracy of Iris flower and modified MNIST hand-written digits from random guessing to near theoretical maximum. We also showcased the consistently enhanced performance of AT over BP for different datasets, including MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST. The AT method demonstrated successful training with minimal hardware overhead and reduced computational overhead, serving as a robust light-weight training alternative to fully explore the advantages of physical computation.

We first explore the use of boson sampling to identify biclusters based on matrix permanents. We then propose a heuristic that finds clusters in a dataset using Gaussian boson sampling by (i) converting the dataset into a bipartite graph and then (ii) running GBS to find the densest sub-graph(s) within the larger bipartite graph.

Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends.

    "abstract": "           Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved flexibility and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the calculation of the contrast variation into each of the subnetworks, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, which guarantees the physical interpretability of variables of the subnetworks. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.         ",

One of the fundamental challenges lies in how to overcome the limitation of traditional generative models to efficiently explore the global chemical space rather than a small localized space. Herein, we develop a framework named MAGECS to address this dilemma, by integrating the bird swarm algorithm and supervised graph neural network to effectively navigate the generative model in the immense chemical space towards materials with target properties. As a demonstration, MAGECS is applied to design compelling alloy electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO$_2$RR) and works extremely well. Specifically, the chemical space of CO$_2$RR is effectively explored, where over 250,000 promising structures with high activity have been generated and notably, the proportion of desired structures is 2.5-fold increased. Moreover, five predicted alloys, i.e., CuAl, AlPd, Sn$_2$Pd$_5$, Sn$_9$Pd$_7$, and CuAlSe$_2$ are successfully synthesized and characterized experimentally, two of which exhibit about 90% Faraday efficiency of CO$_2$RR, and CuAl achieved 76% efficiency for C$_2$ products. This pioneering application of inverse design in CO$_2$RR catalysis showcases the potential of MAGECS to dramatically accelerate the development of functional materials, paving the way for fully automated, artificial intelligence-driven material design.

    "title": "A self-referenced optical phase noise analyzer for quantum technologies",
    "abstract": "           Second generation quantum technologies aim to outperform classical alternatives by utilizing engineered quantum systems. Maintaining the coherence required to enable any quantum advantage requires detailed knowledge and control over the noise the hosting system is subjected to. Characterizing noise processes via their power spectral density is routinely done throughout science and technology and can be a demanding task. Determining the phase noise power spectrum in leading quantum technology platforms, for example, can be either outside the reach of many phase noise analyzers, or be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present and characterize a cost-effective optical phase noise analyzer for quantum technology applications. Using this setup we compare two $\\approx1\\ \\rm{Hz}$ linewidth ultra-stable oscillators near $729\\ \\rm{nm}$, using them as references to determine and discuss the noise floor achieved in this measurement apparatus with a focus on limitations and their tradeoffs. The achieved noise floor in this implementation of a low-cost, all-stock component, low-complexity phase noise analyzer compares favourably to commercial offerings. This setup can find application in particular without a more stable reference or operational quantum system as sensor as would be the case for many component manufacturers.         ",

    "title": "Phase Noise in Real-World Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution",
    "abstract": "           The impact of noise sources in real-world implementations of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocols is investigated, focusing on phase noise from photon sources and connecting fibers. This work emphasizes the role of laser quality, network topology, fiber length, arm balance, and detector performance in determining key rates. Remarkably, it reveals that the leading TF-QKD protocols are similarly affected by phase noise despite different mechanisms. This study demonstrates duty cycle improvements of over a factor of two through narrow-linewidth lasers and phase-control techniques, highlighting the potential synergy with high-precision time/frequency distribution services. Ultrastable lasers, evolving toward integration and miniaturization, offer promise for agile TF-QKD implementations on existing networks. Properly addressing phase noise and practical constraints allows for consistent key rate predictions, protocol selection, and layout design, crucial for establishing secure long-haul links for the Quantum Communication Infrastructures under development in several countries.

    "abstract": "           A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability. The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.         ",

    "title": "Boundary Treatment for Variational Quantum Simulations of Partial Differential Equations on Quantum Computers",
    "abstract": "           The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speed up the optimization procedure.         ",

However, these advantages are often hindered by the difficulty of realizing the required high-dimensional measurements and transformations. Here, we implement a large-scale multi-plane light converter (MPLC) and program it as a high-dimensional mode sorter of spatial modes for QKD. Using the MPLC, we demonstrate five-dimensional QKD with six mutually unbiased bases and 25-dimensional QKD with two mutually unbiased bases in the same experimental setup. Furthermore, we propose a construction of pairs of mutually unbiased bases that are robust to experimental errors, with measurement complexity scaling only with the square root of the encoded dimension. This approach paves the way for QKD implementations in higher dimensions.         ",
