    "abstract": "           Organic electro-optic (OEO) materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters (EOPS) and modulators compared to their inorganic counterparts. Integration with other devices in a silicon photonic (SiP) process, simple nanofabrication, and temperature/aging robustness remain to be developed for this class of hybrid material platforms. In particular, electro-optic (EO) polymers need an electro-thermal poling method, which has limited their potential and utilization in large-scale SiP. Devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals (PN-LC), another primary type of OEO material, feature a very efficient but slow phase shift mechanism. We present a general-purpose EOPS that applies to various modulator embodiments to address these concerns. Based on that, we report a GHz-fast phase shift in a newly discovered family of OEO, namely ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FN-LC), which finally enables liquid crystals to have significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients and associated Pockels effect. The new material avoids poling issues associated with EO polymers and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-OEO systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. Furthermore, we propose a finger-loaded, non-slotted waveguide that enhances light-matter interaction, allowing us to achieve DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\\approx$ 0.25 this http URL and 25.7 this http URL, respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\\approx$ 4 dB, and an EO bandwidth of f$_{-6dB}$ >4.18 GHz. The remaining figures of merit for our poling-free EOPS are equivalent to EO polymer-enabled devices with fewer manufacturing difficulties. We demonstrate an electrically and photonically packaged chip that contains >100 silicon-FN-LC modulators to evaluate the large-scale integration of our poling-free phase shifters and modulators.

    "abstract": "           Recent decades have seen significant advancements in integrated photonics, driven by improvements in nanofabrication technology. This field has developed from integrated semiconductor lasers and low-loss waveguides to optical modulators, enabling the creation of sophisticated optical systems on a chip scale capable of performing complex functions like optical sensing, signal processing, and metrology. The tight confinement of optical modes in photonic waveguides further enhances the optical nonlinearity, leading to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena such as optical frequency combs, second-harmonic generation, and supercontinuum generation. Active tuning of photonic circuits is crucial not only for offsetting variations caused by fabrication in large-scale integration, but also serves as a fundamental component in programmable photonic circuits. Piezoelectric actuation in photonic devices offers a low-power, high-speed solution and is essential in the design of future photonic circuits due to its compatibility with materials like Si and Si3N4, which do not exhibit electro-optic effects. Here, we provide a detailed review of the latest developments in piezoelectric tuning and modulation, by examining various piezoelectric materials, actuator designs tailored to specific applications, and the capabilities and limitations of current technologies. Additionally, we explore the extensive applications enabled by piezoelectric actuators, including tunable lasers, frequency combs, quantum transducers, and optical isolators. These innovative ways of managing photon propagation and frequency on-chip are expected to be highly sought after in the future advancements of advanced photonic chips for both classical and quantum optical information processing and computing.

To the best of our knowledge, no curved waveguides were investigated in sapphire so far and no waveguides for visible light in undoped planar sapphire substrates were reported. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser writing of depressed cladding waveguides in sapphire. Laser parameters such as pulse energy, pulse duration, and repetition rate, as well as waveguide geometry parameters were optimized to guide 728 nm light. This resulted in single-mode waveguides with a propagation loss of 1.9 (3) dB/cm. The investigation of curved waveguides showed a sharp increase in total loss for curvature radii below 15 mm. Our results demonstrate the potential of femtosecond laser writing as a powerful technique for creating integrated optical waveguides in the volume of sapphire substrates.

However, their direct characterization in the terahertz spectral region, of interest for retrieving, e.g., their phonon response, represents a major challenge, due to the limited sensitivity of typical terahertz spectroscopic tools and the weak interaction of such long-wavelength radiation with sub-nanometer systems. In this work, by exploiting an ad-hoc engineered metallic surface enabling a ten-thousand-fold local absorption boost, we perform enhanced terahertz spectroscopy of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (tungsten diselenide) and extract its dipole-active phonon resonance features. In addition, we use these data to obtain the monolayer effective permittivity around its phonon resonance. Via the direct terahertz characterization of the phonon response of such two-dimensional systems, this method opens the path to the rational design of phonon polariton devices exploiting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

The antenna parameters are optimized using Ansys HFSS software and verified experimentally. Ni replaces both Ba at A site and Ti at B site. Such a solid solution has a limit depending on the amount of NiO provided during sintering. A complete study of the structural changes and the dielectric constant enables the correlation with the resonating property. All the samples retain the ferroelectric tetragonal P4mm phase with a nominal decrease in the c/a ratio. NiO incorporation in BTO decreases the sintering temperature and shows two types of morphology associated with BTO-like and NiO-like phases. It induces prominent reduction in the permittivity and loss tangent (<0.01) in the range 100Hz to 1MHz. These properties make these samples suitable for DRA application in the C-Band range [4-8 GHz]. Experimental and theoretical assessment using HFSS software yields a C-band signal at ~7.27 GHz.         ",

For reproducibility, cleaning those residues is the most adopted approach. Herein, we investigate the target-side coated materials and employ them as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. Ballistic aggregated target-side nanofoam is compact and contains higher sp2-carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic-N and lower oxygen content with lower COOH group than that of diffusive aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite-like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic.

    "abstract": "           Hollow electron beams are today highly desirable for many applications, but are still challenging in view of their detection. In this Letter, we focus on the unique character of the electromagnetic radiation that relativistic hollow electron beams can produce when traveling above a metasurface. We investigate theoretically the specific features of the radiation in a coherent mode, which provides the highest intensity, and show that the radiation from a hollow beam can be considerably more intense than that from a conventional solid beam. This solves the problem of distinguishing between hollow and solid beams. Moreover, we consider the two-layer internal structure of a hollow beam and reveal that the radiation characteristics are sensitive to the width and population of each layer. This allows detecting the internal structure of hollow beams. Interestingly, we found that the factor describing the annular beam form is a separated multiplier in a conventional form factor, independent of the properties of periodic structure. Thus, we can conclude that our results will stay correct for different profiles of periodic structures and metasurfaces made of metaatoms of different topologies and forms. The results pave the way towards a variety of newly emerging applications based on hollow electron beams, very diverse in topics, such as manipulation of objects at the nano-level, studies of chiral matter, plasma acceleration in donut wakefields and even applications in huge facilities such as LHC for controlling proton beam halos etc.         ",

    "abstract": "           Multitime quantum correlation functions are central objects in physical science, offering a direct link between experimental observables and the dynamics of an underlying model. While experiments such as 2D spectroscopy and quantum control can now measure such quantities, the accurate simulation of such responses remains computationally expensive and sometimes impossible, depending on the system's complexity. A natural tool to employ is the generalized quantum master equation (GQME), which can offer computational savings by extending reference dynamics at a comparatively trivial cost. However, dynamical methods that can tackle chemical systems with atomistic resolution, such as those in the semiclassical hierarchy, often suffer from poor accuracy, limiting the credence one might lend to their results. By combining work on the accuracy-boosting formulation of semiclassical memory kernels with recent work on the multitime GQME, here we show for the first time that one can exploit a multitime semiclassical GQME to dramatically improve both the accuracy of coarse mean-field Ehrenfest dynamics and obtain orders of magnitude efficiency gains.

One of recent breakthroughs is reducing the size of these systems by utilizing lower-dimensional boundary states, notably via higher-order topological phases. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration of topological laser in anomalous quadrupole topological phase, an instance of higher-order phases. To facilitate this, a topological nanocavity with quality factor near 6,000 is engineered through a twisting operation. The topological nature of our system is validated by calculation of nested Wannier center and the emergency condition of corner states. Our experimental observations reveal the manifestation of corner states and the achievement of single-mode pulsed laser, driven by optical gain from multiple quantum wells at telecommunication wavelengths and at a temperature of 4 K. A lasing threshold of 23 uW and a cold quality factor of 1,500 are deduce through rate equation.

We show that the intermediate regime hosts soliton crystals rather than rogue waves, as reported in the literature.

However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%.

This approach offers very limited insights into the practical significance of using catalysis for quantum information processing.

Leveraging quantum information tools beyond the asymptotic regime, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of catalytic transformations with finite-size catalysts.

Recently, integrated frequency combs are emerging as scalable solutions for on-chip photonics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated superconducting microcomb that is easy to manufacture, simple to operate, and consumes ultra-low power. Our turnkey apparatus comprises a basic nonlinear superconducting device, a Josephson junction, directly coupled to a superconducting microstrip resonator. We showcase coherent comb generation through self-started mode-locking. Therefore, comb emission is initiated solely by activating a DC bias source, with power consumption as low as tens of picowatts. The resulting comb spectrum resides in the microwave domain and spans multiple octaves. The linewidths of all comb lines can be narrowed down to 1 Hz through a unique coherent injection-locking technique. Our work represents a critical step towards fully integrated microwave photonics and offers the potential for integrated quantum processors.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.         ",

The maximum power density record was created by the Free Electron Lasers. In the high-power microwave field, the vacuum devices are still the mainstream microwave sources for applications such as scientific instruments, communications, radars, magnetic confinement fusion heating, microwave weapons, etc. The principles of microwave generation by vacuum tube microwave sources include Cherenkov or Smith-Purcell radiation, transition radiation, and Bremsstrahlung. In this paper, the vacuum tube microwave sources were reviewed in order according to the three radiation principles. Among them, the Vircators can produce 22 GW output power in P-band (0.23-1GHz). Vacuum tubes that can achieve continuous-wave operation include Traveling Wave Tubes, Klystrons, Free Electron Lasers, and Magnetrons, with output power up to 1MW. Vacuum tubes that can generate frequencies of the order of 100 GHz and above include Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes, Gyrotrons, Backward Wave Oscillators, Magnetrons, Surface Wave Oscillators, Free Electron Lasers, Orotrons, etc. Gyrotrons are very attractive in the millimeter wave and THz fields.

Multem 3 is equipped with LAPACK, the state-of-the art Faddeeva complex error function routine, and the Bessel function package AMOS. The amendments significantly improve both the speed, convergence, and precision of Multem 2. Increased stability allows to freely increase the cut-off value LMAX on the number of spherical vector wave functions and the cut-off value RMAX controlling the maximal length of reciprocal vectors taken into consideration. An immediate bonus is that Multem 3 can be reliably used to describe bound states in the continuum (BICs). To ensure convergence of the layer coupling scheme, it appears that appreciably larger values of convergence paramaters LMAX and RMAX are required than those reported in numerous published work in the past using Multem 2. We hope that Multem 3 will become a reliable and fast alternative to generic commercial software, such as COMSOL Multiphysics, CST Microwave Studio, or Ansys HFSS, and that it will become the code of choice for various optimization tasks for a large number of research groups. The improvements concern the core part of Multem 2, which is common to the extensions of Multem 2 for acoustic and elastic multiple scattering and to the original layer-Kohn-Korringa-Rostocker (LKKR) code. Therefore, the enhancements presented here can be readily applied to the above codes as well.         ",

Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.

The atom plays the role of the catalyst, and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity. Considering a cavity prepared in a ``classical'' coherent state, and choosing appropriately the atomic state and the interaction time, we obtain an evolution with the following properties. First, the state of the cavity has been modified, and now features non-classicality, as witnessed by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity. Second, the process is catalytic, in the sense that the atom is deterministically returned to its initial state exactly, and can be re-used multiple times. What is more, we also show that our findings are robust under dissipation and can be applied to scenarios featuring cavity loss and atomic decay.

    "abstract": "           In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation of classical Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an $r$-dimensional subspace. A first order Suzuki-Trotter approximation for the evolution operator enables us to isolate the non-unitary operators (associated with dissipation) from the unitary operators (associated with lossless media). The unitary operators can be implemented through qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) on $n$ qubits. However, the non-unitary-dissipative part poses a challenge on how it should be implemented on a quantum computer. In this paper, two probabilistic dilation algorithms are considered for handling the dissipative operators. The first algorithm is based on treating the classical dissipation as a linear amplitude damping-type completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum channel where the combined system-environment must undergo unitary evolution in the dilated space. The unspecified environment can be modeled by just one ancillary qubit, resulting in an implementation scaling of $\\textit{O}(2^{n-1}n^2)$ elementary gates for the dilated unitary evolution operator. The second algorithm approximates the non-unitary operators by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). We obtain an optimized representation of the non-unitary part, which requires $\\textit{O}(2^{n})$ elementary gates. Applying the LCU method for a simple dielectric medium with homogeneous dissipation rate, the implementation scaling can be further reduced into $\\textit{O}[poly(n)]$ basic gates. For the particular case of weak dissipation we show that our proposed post-selective dilation algorithms can efficiently delve into the transient evolution dynamics of dissipative systems by calculating the respective implementation circuit depth. A connection of our results with the non-linear-in-normalization-only (NINO) quantum channels is also presented.         ",

    "abstract": "           Atoms confined in a three-dimensional dissipative optical lattice oscillate inside potential wells, occasionally hopping to adjacent wells, thereby diffusing in all directions. Illumination by a weak probe beam modulates the lattice, yielding propagating atomic density waves, referred to as Brillouin modes which travel perpendicular to the direction of travel of the probe. The probe is made incident at a small angle relative to a lattice symmetry axis, yielding a driving potential perturbation whose spatial period is not a multiple of the period of the underlying optical potential, thus enabling exploration of the regime of space quasiperiodic drive. A theory, based on the Fourier decomposition of the current into its atomic density wave contributions, reveals that unlike the previously studied time quasiperiodic case, wherein a lattice driven by two incommensurate frequencies may exhibit abrupt suppression in directed current as the driving transitions from quasiperiodic to periodic, a spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattice exhibits no such abrupt response. Further, detailed modeling of spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattices reveals that directed propagation occurs not only as a consequence of velocity-matching between the propagating modulation and the average velocity of the atom oscillating inside a well as was previously reported in the literature, but also as a distinct consequence of a new mechanism, namely, frequency-matching between the modulation frequency and the oscillation frequencies. A systematic measurement of the transmitted probe spectra as a function of off-axis probe angle is presented, which is consistent with the velocity- and frequency-matching predictions from the detailed model.

Here we propose a general approach to selectively condense and switch between ferroaxial domains with light. We show that circularly polarized light pulses on resonance with infrared-active phonons manifest helicity-dependent control over ferroaxial domains. Nonlinear contributions to the lattice polarizability play an essential role in this phenomenon.
