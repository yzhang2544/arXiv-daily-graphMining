    "title": "Inactive Overhang in Silicon Anodes",
    "abstract": "           Li-ion batteries contain excess anode area to improve manufacturability and prevent Li plating. These overhang areas in graphite electrodes are active but experience decreased Li+ flux during cycling. Over time, the overhang and the anode portions directly opposite to the cathode can exchange Li+, driven by differences in local electrical potential across the electrode, which artificially inflates or decreases the measured cell capacity. Here, we show that lithiation of the overhang is less likely to happen in silicon anodes paired with layered oxide cathodes. The large voltage hysteresis of silicon creates a lower driving force for Li+ exchange as lithium ions transit into the overhang, rendering this exchange highly inefficient. For crystalline Si particles, Li+ storage at the overhang is prohibitive, because the low potential required for the initial lithiation can act as thermodynamic barrier for this exchange. We use micro-Raman spectroscopy to demonstrate that crystalline Si particles at the overhang are never lithiated even after cell storage at 45 oC for four months. Since the anode overhang can affect the forecasting of cell life, cells using silicon anodes may require different methodologies for life estimation compared to those used for traditional graphite-based Li-ion batteries.

    "abstract": "           Pulsed visible lasers either by Q-switching or mode locking have been attracting intense attentions both in solid-state laser and fiber laser. Here, we report on the simultaneous manipulation of reconfigurable sub-pulse sequences and customizable high-order vortex beams in an actively Q-switched visible laser. On the one hand, pulse sequences with up to 4 sub-pulses could be generated and fully controlled by means of an acoustic-optic modulator driven by an arbitrary waveform generator. Both pulse number and pulse intensity can be manipulated through the programmable step-signal, which is also theoretically simulated through the rate equations. On the other hand, assisted by the off-axis pumping technique and the astigmatic mode conversion, the laser cavity could emit high-quality vortex beams carrying Laguerre-Gaussian modes up to 30th order. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most flexible active manipulations not only on the intensity distribution of the transverse modes but also on the temporal distribution of the pulse sequences in a visible laser. The versatile manipulating techniques in this work could be immediately implemented into all other solid-state lasers to obtain sub-pulse vortex beams, which may provide enhanced functionality and flexibility for a large range of laser systems.

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate the generation of instability waves triggered by the upstream acoustic forcing near the nozzle lip of a supersonic jet. This represents an important stage, i.e. the jet receptivity, of the screech feedback loop. The upstream acoustic forcing, resulting from the shock-instability interaction, reaches the nozzle lip and excites new shear-layer instability waves. To obtain the newly-excited instability wave, we first determine the scattered sound field due to the upstream forcing using the Wiener-Hopf technique, with the kernel function factored using asymptotic expansions and overlapping approximations. Subsequently, the unsteady Kutta condition is imposed at the nozzle lip, enabling the derivation of the dispersion relation for the newly-excited instability wave. A linear transfer function between the upstream forcing and the newly-excited instability wave is obtained. We calculate the amplitude and phase delay in this receptivity process and examine their variations against the frequency. The phase delay enables us to re-evaluate the phase condition for jet screech and propose a new frequency prediction model. The new model shows improved agreement between the predicted screech frequencies and the experimental data compared to classical models. It is hoped that this model may help in developing a full screech model.         ",

Co ablation of titanium and vanadium nitride targets together with graphite allowed us to synthesize carbon-metal oxynitride porous nanocomposite and exploit them as a binder-free thin film supercapacitor electrode in aqueous electrolyte. We show that the elemental composition ratio and hence the structural properties can be tuned by selecting target configuration and by manipulating the ablation position.

Conventional OVA technologies are mostly based on discrete optoelectronic components, leading to unsatisfactory system sizes, complexity, and stability. They also encounter challenges in revealing the on-chip characteristics of integrated photonic devices, which are often overwhelmed by the substantial coupling loss and extra spectral response at chip facets. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized OVA system for integrated photonics devices based on broadband single sideband (SSB) modulators on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. The OVA could provide a direct probe of both amplitude and phase responses of photonic devices with kHz-level resolution and tens of terahertz measurement bandwidth. We perform in-situ characterizations of single and coupled microring resonators fabricated on the same chip as the OVA, unfolding their intrinsic loss and coupling states unambiguously. Furthermore, we achieve the direct measurement of collective phase dynamics and density of states of the Bloch modes in a synthetic frequency crystal, by in-situ OVA of a dynamically modulated microring resonator. Our in-situ OVA system provides a compact, high-precision, and broadband solution for characterizing future integrated photonic devices and circuits, with potential applications ranging from optical communications, biosensing, neuromorphic computing, to quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "           The emerging technique of serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) can be used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules to high spatial and temporal resolutions. An ongoing challenge for SFX is the damage caused by the ultrabright X-ray free electron laser pulse. Though it is often assumed that sufficiently femtosecond pulses `outrun' radiation damage, in reality electronic damage processes commence during exposure. We model the electronic damage to protein nanocrystals using a plasma model that tracks the continuous changes to the energy distribution of the unbound electrons. Tracking the continuous energy distribution is of particular importance for distinguishing the influence of differing elements on secondary damage processes. Heavy atoms have a ubiquitous but small presence in protein targets - typically as integral components of the macromolecule and as salts in the solvent. We find that these atoms considerably influence the simulated ionization and scattering behavior of realistic targets due to their rapid seeding of secondary ionization processes. In lysozyme, even the presence of native sulfur atoms significantly contributes to theoretical measures of damage-induced noise for >= 6 keV, 15 fs pulses. Contributing to the effect is that heavy atoms seed `intermediate' energy electron cascades that are particularly effective at ionizing the target on the femtosecond timescale. In addition, the disproportionate effect of heavy atoms means the damage to a protein crystal can be sensitive to their presence in the solvent. Outside of reducing the concentration of heavy atoms in the target, these results suggest the dose limits of SFX targets will be higher where the ionization of deep >~ 6 keV absorption edges is minimized, or, to a lesser extent, when such edges are only ionized with X-rays >> 2 keV above their binding energy.

It is therefore essential to directly verify or rule out these theories experimentally. However, despite substantial efforts in astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, previous tests have not yet acquired enough accuracy to provide decisive conclusions as to the validity of these theories. Here, using a diamagnetically levitated force sensor, we carry out a test on one of the most compelling explanations for dark energy to date, namely the Chameleon theory, an ultra-light scalar field with screening mechanisms, which couples to normal-matter fields and leaves a detectable fifth force. Our results extend previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude to the entire physical plausible parameter space of cosmologically viable chameleon models. We find no evidence for such a fifth force. Our results decisively rule out the basic chameleon model as a candidate for dark energy. Our work, thus, demonstrates the robustness of laboratory experiments in unveiling the nature of dark energy in the future.

In addition, the width and height of the transparency window can be controlled through the effective optomechanical coupling, which is readily adjusted by altering changing the nanosphere's radius and the Coulomb interaction. One of the most interesting result is the transition NMIT behavior in $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and broken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime.

We determine that both modes have propagation losses dominated by scatter, and that the absorption due to the sample only accounts for 3% of the measured losses for both modes. The TM mode has better overlap with the sample than the TE mode, but the TM mode also has a stronger propagation loss due to sidewall and sample induced scattering (32.5 $\\pm$ 0.3 dB/cm) compared to the TE mode (23.0 $\\pm$ 0.2 dB/cm). The TE mode is, therefore, more appropriate for sensing. Our findings have important implications for on-chip lithium niobate-based sensor designs.         ",

    "abstract": "           Molecular docking plays a pivotal role in drug discovery and precision medicine, enabling us to understand protein functions and advance novel therapeutics. Here, we introduce a potential alternative solution to this problem, the digitized-counterdiabatic quantum approximate optimization algorithm (DC-QAOA), which utilizes counterdiabatic driving and QAOA on a quantum computer. Our method was applied to analyze diverse biological systems, including the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex with PM-2-020B, the DPP-4 complex with piperidine fused imidazopyridine 34, and the HIV-1 gp120 complex with JP-III-048. The DC-QAOA exhibits superior performance, providing more accurate and biologically relevant docking results, especially for larger molecular docking problems. Moreover, QAOA-based algorithms demonstrate enhanced hardware compatibility in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, indicating their potential for efficient implementation under practical docking scenarios. Our findings underscore quantum computing's potential in drug discovery and offer valuable insights for optimizing protein-ligand docking processes.         ",

    "title": "Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range",
    "abstract": "           The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \\cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\\, MHz, $ 2 \\cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\\, GHz, and $ 6 \\cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.

    "title": "Field, frequency and temperature dependence of the surface resistance of nitrogen diffused niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities",
    "abstract": "           We report the RF performance of several single-cell superconducting radio-frequency cavities subjected to low temperature heat treatment in nitrogen environment. The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 $^{\\circ}$C for an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in $Q_0$ with a Q-rise was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at $\\sim$300 $^{\\circ} $C during the cavity cooldown from 800 $^{\\circ}$C and held at 165 $^{\\circ}$C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of $\\sim 0.95$~GHz above which the Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2~K. Some of these results can be explained qualitatively with an existing model of intrinsic field-dependence of the surface resistance with both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions. The change in the Q-slope below 0.95 GHz may result from masking contribution of trapped magnetic flux to the residual surface resistance.         ",

    "abstract": "           I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or \"interpretations\" of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT). GQT postulates different sets of features, and the combination of these different features can help generate different quantum theories. Furthermore, this ontology makes quantum indeterminacy and determinacy play an important explanatory role in accounting for when quantum systems whose values of their properties are indeterminate become determinate. The process via which determinate values arise varies between the different quantum theories. Moreover, quantum states represent quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each quantum theory specifies a structure with certain features. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the Many-Worlds Interpretation, single-world relationalist theories such as Relational Quantum Mechanics, Bohmian Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. I will argue that GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of important benefits that current widely discussed ontologies lack, namely, wavefunction realism and primitive ontology, without some of their costs. For instance, it helps generate quantum theories that are clearly compatible with relativistic causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Also, GQT has the benefit of providing new ways to compare and evaluate quantum theories, which may lead to philosophical and scientific progress on these issues.         ",

    "abstract": "           Evaluating multi-center molecular integrals with Cartesian Gaussian-type basis sets has been a long-standing bottleneck in electronic structure theory calculation for solids and molecules. We have developed a vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling scheme to solve molecular Coulomb integrals with solid harmonics basis functions(SHGO). Solid harmonics are eigenstates of angular momentum, making it possible to factorize molecular integrals. By combining solid harmonic addition, differential and product rules, the computationally costly multi-center four-center integrals can be factored into an angular part and a radial component dependent on the atomic positions. The potential speed-up ratio in evaluating molecular nuclear Coulomb integrals in our method can reach up to four orders of magnitude for atomic orbitals with high angular momentum quantum numbers. The foundation underpinning the mathematical efficiency is the quantum angular momentum theory, where both vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling schemes correspond to unitary Clebsch-Gordan transformations that act on quantum angular momentum states, influencing their degree of entanglement. By incorporating quantum angular momentum through these transformations, the entanglement of the states can be reduced, and the less entanglement there is for a quantum system, the easier it is to simulate. The highly efficient method unveiled here opens new avenues for accelerated material and molecule design and discovery.         ",
