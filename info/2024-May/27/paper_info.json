    "abstract": "           Single-photon detectors based on the superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) are used in a number of visible to near-infrared (VNIR) applications, particularly for photon-number-resolving measurements in quantum information science. To be practical for large-scale photonic quantum computing or for future spectroscopic imaging applications in astronomy, the size of VNIR TES arrays must be increased from a few pixels to many thousands. Historically, TES arrays have been read out with multiplexed superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), but the microsecond-duration pulse signals of VNIR TESs are notoriously difficult to multiplex. In this manuscript, we introduce the kinetic inductance current sensor (KICS), a more readily scalable readout technology that exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance in a superconducting resonator to make sensitive current measurements. KICS devices can replace SQUIDs for many applications because of their ability to measure fast, high slew-rate signals, their compatibility with standard microwave frequency-division multiplexing techniques, and their relatively simple fabrication. Here, we demonstrate the readout of a VNIR TES using a KICS with $3.7$ $\\text{MHz}$ of bandwidth. We measure a readout noise of $1.4$ $\\text{pA}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$, considerably below the TES noise at frequencies of interest, and a TES energy resolution of $(0.137 \\pm 0.001)$ $\\text{eV}$ at $0.8$ $\\text{eV}$, comparable to resolutions observed with non-multiplexed SQUID readouts.

However, the widespread adoption of this technique has been hindered by the complexity and alignment sensitivity of mid-infrared frequency comb sources. Leveraging the underexplored mid-infrared window of silica fibers presents a promising approach to address these challenges. In this study, we present the first experimental demonstration and quantitative numerical description of mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers. Our all-silica-fiber frequency comb spans over two octaves (0.8 $\\mu$m to 3.5 $\\mu$m) with a power output of 100 mW in the mid-infrared region. The amplified quantum noise is suppressed using four-cycle (25 fs) driving pulses, with the carrier-envelope offset frequency exhibiting a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB and a free-running bandwidth of 90 kHz. Our developed model provides quantitative guidelines for mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers, enabling all-fiber frequency comb spectroscopy in diverse fields such as organic synthesis, pharmacokinetics processes, and environmental monitoring.

    "abstract": "           Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning model for general accelerated MRI reconstruction. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study built a magnetic resonance image processing transformer (MR-IPT) which includes multi-head-tails and a single shared window transformer main body. Three mutations of MR-IPT with different transformer structures were implemented to guide the design of our MR-IPT model. Pre-trained on the MRI set of RadImageNet including 672675 images with multiple anatomy categories, the model was further migrated and evaluated on fastMRI knee dataset with 25012 images for downstream reconstruction tasks. We performed comparison studies with three CNN-based conventional networks in zero- and few-shot learning scenarios. Transfer learning process was conducted on both MR-IPT and CNN networks to further validate the generalizability of MR-IPT. To study the model performance stability, we evaluated our model with various downstream dataset sizes ranging from 10 to 2500 images. Result: The MR-IPT model provided superior performance in multiple downstream tasks compared to conventional CNN networks. MR-IPT achieved a PSNR/SSIM of 26.521/0.6102 (4-fold) and 24.861/0.4996 (8-fold) in 10-epoch learning, surpassing UNet128 at 25.056/0.5832 (4-fold) and 22.984/0.4637 (8-fold). With the same large-scale pre-training, MR-IPT provided a 5% performance boost compared to UNet128 in zero-shot learning in 8-fold and 3% in 4-fold. Conclusion: MR-IPT framework benefits from its transformer-based structure and large-scale pre-training and can serve as a solid backbone in other downstream tasks with zero- and few-shot learning.

The proposed scheme is capable of producing results in good agreement with corresponding conventional NEVPT2 simulations, while significantly reducing the cost of quantum measurements and allowing for embarrassingly parallel estimations of higher-order RDMs in classical post-processing. Our scheme shows favourable scaling of the total number of shots with respect to system size.

In thin films, conventionally, a charge current flowing in a heavy metal is used to generate transverse spin currents and to exert torques on the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic thin film layer. Here, in contrast to the typically employed heavy metals, we study spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic heterostructures with large spin-orbit interaction that function as the torque-generating layers. In particular, we chose perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) multilayers [Co/Ni] and [Co/Pt] as the torque-generating layers and drive magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnetic thin film $\\mathrm{Co_{20}Fe_{60}B_{20}}$ (CoFeB) layers with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). We investigate the spin dynamics driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) and the concomitant charge current generation by the inverse SOT process using an inductive technique based on a vector network analyzer. In our experimental findings, we find that the SOTs generated by our multilayers are of a magnitude comparable to those produced by Pt, consistent with first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we noted a significant correlation between the SOT and the thickness of the CoFeB layer.         ",

We derive the master equation that governs the evolution of the ground state of the atoms and the quantum state of light. Solving the master equation exactly without invoking the Holstein-Primakoff approximation and projecting out the quantum state of light, we derive a positive operator-valued measure that describes the QND measurement. We show that at high spontaneous emission conditions, the QND measurement has a unique dominant state to which the measurement collapses. We additionally investigate the behavior of the QND measurement in the limiting case of strong atom-light interactions, where we show that the positive operator valued measure becomes a projection operator. We further analyze the effect of spontaneous emission noise on atomic state preparation. We find that it limits the width of the eigenvalue spectrum available to a quantum state in a linear superposition. This effect leads to state collapse on the dominant state. We generate various non-classical states of the atom by tuning the atom-light interaction strength. We find that non-classical states such as the Schr\u00f6dinger-cat state, whose coherence spans the entire eigenvalue spectrum of the total spin operator $J_z$ for a given spin eigenvalue $J$, lose their coherence because spontaneous emission limits the accessibility of states farther away from the dominant state.

    "abstract": "           Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, $B$, that confines charged particles effectively in a three-dimensional toroidal plasma equilibrium. Here, we show that QS has a deep connection to the underlying symmetry that makes solitons possible. Our approach uncovers a hidden lower dimensionality of $B$ on a magnetic flux surface, which could make stellarator optimization schemes significantly more efficient. Recent numerical breakthroughs have yielded configurations with excellent volumetric QS and surprisingly low magnetic shear. Our approach elucidates why the magnetic shear is low in these configurations. Furthermore, we deduce an upper bound on the maximum toroidal volume that can be quasisymmetric and verify it for the Landreman-Paul precise quasiaxisymmetric (QA) stellarator configuration. In the neighborhood of the outermost surface, we show that the B approaches the form of the 1-soliton reflectionless potential. We present three independent approaches to demonstrate that quasisymmetric $B$ is described by well-known integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The first approach is weakly nonlinear multiscale perturbation theory, which highlights the crucial role that magnetic shear plays in QS. We show that the overdetermined problem of finding quasisymmetric vacuum fields admits solutions for which the rotational transform is not free but highly constrained. We obtain the KdV equation (and, more specifically, Gardner's equation for certain choices of parameters). Our second approach is non-perturbative and based on ensuring single-valuedness of $B$, which directly leads to its Painlev\u00e9 property shared by the KdV equation. Our third approach uses machine learning, trained on a large dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators. We robustly recover the KdV (and Gardner's) equation from the data.

However, the challenge of co-integrating the multiple components of high-performance laser systems has left application of these nanoscale devices thwarted by bulky laser sources that are orders of magnitude larger than the devices themselves. Here we show that the two main ingredients for high-performance lasers -- noise reduction and isolation -- currently requiring serial combination of incompatible technologies, can be sourced simultaneously from a single, passive, CMOS-compatible nanophotonic device. To do this, we take advantage of both the long photon lifetime and the nonreciprocal Kerr nonlinearity of a high quality factor silicon nitride ring resonator to self-injection lock a semiconductor laser chip while also providing isolation. Additionally, we identify a previously unappreciated power regime limitation of current on-chip laser architectures which our system overcomes. Using our device, which we term a unified laser stabilizer, we demonstrate an on-chip integrated laser system with built-in isolation and noise reduction that operates with turnkey reliability. This approach departs from efforts to directly miniaturize and integrate traditional laser system components and serves to bridge the gap to fully integrated optical technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           We show how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.

    "abstract": "           In the era of Big Data, prompt analysis and processing of data sets is critical. Meanwhile, statistical methods provide key tools and techniques to extract valuable insights and knowledge from complex data sets. This paper creatively applies statistical methods to the field of traffic, particularly focusing on the preprocessing of multi-frame signals obtained by optical fiber-based Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system. An online non-parametric regression model based on Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) and variable bandwidth selection is employed to dynamically update the estimation of mean function as signals flow in. This mean estimation method can derive average information of multi-frame fiber signals, thus providing the basis for the subsequent vehicle trajectory extraction algorithms. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparison experiments were conducted under real highway scenarios, showing that our approach not only deals with multi-frame signals more accurately than the classical filter-based Kalman and Wavelet methods, but also meets the needs better under the condition of saving memory and rapid responses. It provides a new reliable means for signal processing which can be integrated with other existing methods.         ",

    "abstract": "           Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \\times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.
