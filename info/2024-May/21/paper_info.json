    "abstract": "           In this research, we developed a low-power silicon photonics foundry-fabricated slow-light thermal phase shifter (SLTPS) where the slow-light (SL) effect is achieved using an integrated Bragg grating (BG) waveguide. Heating the grating induces a red shift in the transmission spectrum, leading to an increased group index $n_g$ during operation, which facilitates a further reduction in the voltage needed for a $\\pi$ phase shift, i.e. $V_{\\pi}$. Additionally, we investigated a compact Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) that incorporates the SLTPS in both arms with a phase shifter length of 50 $\\mu$m. A detailed theoretical analysis was conducted to address the non-idealities of the SL-MZI due to uneven optical power splitting and unbalanced loss in the two MZI arms. The $V_{\\pi}$ and power consumption for a $\\pi$ phase shift $(P_{\\pi})$ of the SL-MZI were quantified for operation in the slow light regime, demonstrating a $V_{\\pi}$ of 1.1 V and a $P_{\\pi}$ of 3.63 mW at an operational wavelength near the photonic band edge. The figure of merit (FOM) $P_{\\pi} \\times \\tau$ is commonly used to assess the performance of thermal optical switches. The SL-MZI in this work has achieved a low $P_{\\pi} \\times \\tau$ of 5.1 mW $\\mu$s. Insertion loss of the SL-MZI ranges from 1.3 dB to 4.4 dB depending on the operation wavelength, indicating a trade-off with the $V_\\pi$ reduction.         ",

    "abstract": "           Appropriately designed dual-core fibers using coupling-length phase matching (CLPM) allow for phase-matched frequency downconversion over wide frequency intervals using the third-order optical nonlinearity of glass. By tuning the distance between the two cores, CLPM allows continuously tunable phase matching for widely different wavelengths for the process in which a pump wave at a frequency $\\omega_2$ generates or amplifies two waves with frequencies $\\omega_3>\\omega_2$ and $\\omega_1 = 2 \\omega_2 - \\omega_3$. The intensity-dependent correction that accounts for nonlinear phase-modulation is derived in general. In addition, a specific CLPM configuration is found to be insensitive to phase-modulation, and can achieve 100\\% theoretical quantum yield for pump wave injection in one core. Fiber-based frequency converters can thus be designed for large differences between pump wavelengths and generated wavelengths, with the phase-matched interaction enabling the use of meter-long fibers to compensate for low third-order susceptibilities. Examples of fiber designs for pump wavelengths at 1.3 and 1.55 $\\mu$m, to generate radiation with wavelengths longer than 2 $\\mu$m, are discussed for silica and fluoride fibers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cold atom interferometry (CAI)-based quantum accelerometers are very promising for future satellite gravity missions thanks to their strength in providing long-term stable and precise measurements of non-gravitational accelerations. However, their limitations due to the low measurement rate and the existence of ambiguities in the raw sensor measurements call for hybridization of the quantum accelerometer (Q-ACC) with a classical one (e.g., electrostatic) with higher bandwidth. While previous hybridization studies have so far considered simple noise models for the Q-ACC and neglected the impact of satellite rotation on the phase shift of the accelerometer, we perform here a more advanced hybridization simulation by implementing a comprehensive noise model for the satellite-based quantum accelerometers and considering the full impact of rotation, gravity gradient, and self-gravity on the instrument. We perform simulation studies for scenarios with different assumptions about quantum and classical sensors and satellite missions. The performance benefits of the hybrid solutions, taking the synergy of both classical and quantum accelerometers into account, will be quantified. We found that implementing a hybrid accelerometer onboard a future gravity mission improves the gravity solution by one to two orders in lower and higher degrees. In particular, the produced global gravity field maps show a drastic reduction in the instrumental contribution to the striping effect after introducing measurements from the hybrid accelerometers.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, \\textit{a posteriori}, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.

The method refers to a two-mode system with the vibrations at significantly different frequencies. The signal from one mode is used to control the other mode. In the experiment, self-sustained oscillations of micromechanical modes are excited by pumping at the blue-detuned sideband of the higher-frequency mode. Phase fluctuations of the two modes show near perfect anti-correlation. They can be compensated in either one of the modes by a stepwise change of the pump phase. The phase change of the controlled mode is proportional to the pump phase change, with the proportionality constant independent of the pump amplitude and frequency. This finding allows us to stabilize the phase of one mode against phase diffusion using the measured phase of the other mode. We demonstrate that phase fluctuations of either the high or low frequency mode can be significantly reduced. The results open new opportunities in generating stable vibrations in a broad frequency range via parametric downconversion in nonlinear resonators.         ",

The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\\to [ODD]^{\\#} \\to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \\to [ArHCl]^{\\#} \\to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity.

    "abstract": "           Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest the potential to revolutionize computational algorithms across various scientific domains including oceanography and atmospheric science. The field is still relatively young and quantum computation is so different from classical computation that suitable frameworks to represent oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are yet to be explored. Quantum annealing, one of the major paradigms, focuses on combinatorial optimization tasks. In this paper, we solve the classical Stommel problem by quantum annealing (QA) and simulated annealing (SA), a classical counterpart of quantum annealing. We cast the linear partial differential equation into an optimization problem by the least-squares method and discretize the cost function in two ways: finite difference and truncated basis expansion. In either case, SA successfully reproduces the expected solution when appropriate parameters are chosen, demonstrating that annealing has the potential. In contrast, QA using the D-Wave quantum annealing machine fails to obtain good solutions for some cases owing to hardware limitations; in particular, the highly limited connectivity graph of the machine limits the size of the solvable problems, at least under currently available algorithms. Either expanding the connectivity graph or improving the graph embedding algorithms would probably be necessary for quantum annealing machines to be usable for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics problems. While this finding emphasizes the need for hardware improvements and enhancements in graph embedding algorithms for practical applications of quantum annealers, the results from simulated annealing suggest its potential to address practical geophysical dynamics problems. As quantum calculation continues to evolve, addressing these challenges may lead to transformative advancements in ocean and atmosphere modeling.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, a compact wideband dual-polarized Luneburg lens antenna (LLA) with reduced anisotropy and improved impedance matching is proposed in Ka band with a wide 2D beamscanning capability. Based on transformation optics, the spherical Luneburg lens is compressed into a cylindrical one, while the merits of high gain, broad band, wide scanning, and free polarization are preserved. A trigonometric function is employed to the material property of the flattened Luneburg lens with reduced anisotropy, thus effectively alleviates the strong reflection, the high sidelobes and back radiation with a free cost on the antenna weight and volume. Furthermore, a light thin wideband 7-by-1 metasurface phased array is studied as the primary feed for the LLA. The proposed metantenna, shorted for metamaterial-based antenna, has a high potential for B5G, future wireless communication and radar sensing as an onboard system.         ",

Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast processes and thermal response upon excitation of two-layered complexes consisting of fused silica thin films placed on silicon substrates with ultrashort pulsed lasers in the Mid-IR spectral regime. Through the development of a theoretical model, we demonstrate that the control of the underlying ultrafast phenomena and the damage threshold (DT) of the substrate are achieved via an appropriate modulation of the thickness of the SiO2 film. It is shown that a decrease of DT by up to 27% compared to the absence of coating is feasible emphasising the impact of coatings of a lower refractive index than the substrate. Besides this, it is demonstrated that no absorption of energy occurs within the SiO2 layer, therefore the dynamics of the reflectivity of the two-layered complex is directly associated with the electron excitation in the substrate. These remarkable predictions can be employed for the development of new optical coatings and components for nonlinear optics and photonics for a large range of Mid-IR laser-based applications.

    "abstract": "           Acoustic holographic lenses, also known as acoustic holograms, can change the phase of a transmitted wavefront in order to shape and construct complex ultrasound pressure fields, often for focusing the acoustic energy on a target region. These lenses have been proposed for transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to create diffraction-limited focal zones that target specific brain regions while compensating for skull aberration. Holograms for tFUS are currently designed using time-reversal approaches in full-wave time-domain numerical simulations. However, such simulations need time-consuming computations, which severely limits the adoption of iterative optimization strategies. Furthermore, in the time-reversal method, the number and distribution of virtual sources can significantly influence the final sound field. Because of the computational constraints, predicting these effects and determining the optimal arrangement is challenging. This study introduces an efficient method for designing acoustic holograms using a volumetric holographic technique to generate focused fields inside the skull. The proposed method combines a modified mixed-domain method for ultrasonic propagation with a gradient descent iterative optimization algorithm. This approach enables substantially faster holographic computation than previously reported techniques. The iterative process uses explicitly defined loss functions to bias the ultrasound field's optimization parameters to specific desired characteristics, such as axial resolution, transversal resolution, coverage, and focal region uniformity, while eliminating the uncertainty associated with virtual sources in time-reversal techniques. Numerical studies are conducted on four brain structures: the anterior insula, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala. The findings are further validated in underwater experiments with a 3D-printed skull phantom.         ",

The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally, increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them. Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach. By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the generation of void arrays in PDMS.

The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories.

When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives.

    "abstract": "           We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.
