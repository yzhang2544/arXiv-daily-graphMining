This has been achieved with a (100 x 100) $\\mu$m$^2$ Ti-Au bilayer TES, with a critical temperature of about 84 mK. The electrons are produced directly in the cryostat by a cold-cathode source based on field emission from vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes. We obtain a Gaussian energy resolution between 0.8 and 1.8 eV for fully-absorbed electrons in the (95-105) eV energy range, which is found to be compatible with the resolution of this same device for photons in the same energy range. This measurement opens new possibilities in the field of electron detection.         ",

Our approach relies on the use of microscope objectives that are in-vacuum but at room temperature, in combination with windowless thermal shields into which the objectives are protruding to ensure a cryogenic environment for the trapped atoms. To achieve enough optical power for efficient trapping, we combine two lasers at slightly different wavelengths. We discuss the performance and limitations of our design.

Additionally, modifications to $k$ ($\\Delta k$) are derived from phase shifts in the reflected SC.

    "abstract": "           Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging platform which enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which quantifies fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyze collagen-dense and collagen-sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE-PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.

    "abstract": "           We demonstrate absorber-free passive and hybrid mode-locking at sub-GHz repetition rates using a hybrid integrated extended cavity diode laser around 1550 nm. The laser is based on InP as gain medium and a long Si$_3$N$_4$ feedback circuit, with three highly frequency selective microring resonators. The feedback resonators not only increases the cavity length up to 0.6 m to achieve sub-GHz repetition rates but also serve as a dispersive narrowband mirror for sharp spectral filtering, which enables Fourier domain mode-locking. We observe passive mode-locking with repetition rates below 500 MHz, with $\\approx$ 15 comb lines at around 0.2 mW total power. To stabilize the repetition rate, hybrid mode-locking is demonstrated by weak RF modulation of the diode current at frequencies around 500 MHz. The RF injection reduces the Lorentzian linewidth component from 8.9 kHz to a detection limited value around 300 mHz. To measure the locking range of the repetition rate, the injected RF frequency is tuned with regard to the passive mode-locking frequency and the injected RF power is varied. The locking range increases approximately as a square-root function of the injected RF power. At 1 mW injection a wide locking range of about 80 MHz is obtained. We observe the laser maintaining stable mode-locking also when the DC diode pump current is increased from 40 mA to 190 mA, provided that the cavity length is maintained constant with thermo-refractive tuning.

Absence of demonstrated GHz single-cycle lasers constrains exploration of single/sub-cycle dynamics at this repetition rate. By leveraging fiber soliton effects and suppressing higher-order dispersion, we achieve single-cycle pulse generation at a 1 GHz repetition rate in an all-fiber format. The laser produces 7.1 fs (1.1-cycle) pulses with 1.8 W average power, centered around 1970 nm. Temporal characterization shows 60% of the pulse energy is concentrated in the pulse center, yielding a peak power of 110 kW. The seed laser demonstrates a 43 dB signal-to-noise ratio for the CEO frequency, facilitating comb stabilization and CEO control. Our model, which matches experimental observations, identifies conditions for achieving single-cycle duration and predicts scalability to a 2 GHz repetition rate. This work presents the first GHz single-cycle source.

    "abstract": "           LiteBIRD, a forthcoming JAXA mission, aims to accurately study the microwave sky within the 40-400 GHz frequency range divided into 15 distinct nominal bands. The primary objective is to constrain the CMB inflationary signal, specifically the primordial B-modes. LiteBIRD targets the CMB B-mode signal on large angular scales, where the primordial inflationary signal is expected to dominate, with the goal of reaching a tensor-to-scalar ratio sensitivity of $\\sigma_r\\sim0.001$. LiteBIRD frequency bands will be split among three telescopes, with some overlap between telescopes for better control of systematic effects. Here we report on the development status of the detector arrays for the Low Frequency Telescope (LFT), which spans the 34-161 GHz range, with 12 bands subdivided between four types of trichroic pixels consisting of lenslet-coupled sinuous antennas. The signal from the antenna is bandpass filtered and sensed by AlMn Transition-Edge Sensors (TES). We provide an update on the status of the design and development of LiteBIRD's LFT LF1 (40-60-78 GHz), LF2 (50-68-89 GHz) pixels. We discuss design choices motivated by LiteBIRD scientific goals. In particular we focus on the details of the optimization of the design parameters of the sinuous antenna, on-chip bandpass filters, cross-under and impedance transformers and all the RF components that define the LF1 and LF2 pixel detection chain.

Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience.

The interaction between the photoelectron and parent core transforms from soft collision to recollision as the laser field tuned from elliptical to linear polarization, which can be reflected in THz emission. The soft collision is found to be more effective in reconstructing electron dynamics through THz polarization, which enables to construct the effective core potential of the generating medium with the Coulomb-reshaped THz radiation in an elliptically polarized laser field.

While rare-earth ion-doped crystals offer ultra-narrow optical filtering via spectral hole burning, their applications have primarily been limited to those using bulk crystals, restricting their utility. In this work, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced spectral filtering based on rare-earth ions in an integrated nonlinear optical platform. We incorporate rare-earth ions into high quality-factor ring resonators patterned in thin-film lithium niobate. By spectral hole burning at 4K in a critically coupled resonance mode, we achieve bandpass filters ranging from 7 MHz linewidth, with 13.0 dB of extinction, to 24 MHz linewidth, with 20.4 dB of extinction. By reducing the temperature to 100 mK to eliminate phonon broadening, we achieve an even narrower linewidth of 681 kHz, which is comparable to the narrowest filter linewidth demonstrated in an integrated photonic device, while only requiring a small device footprint. Moreover, the cavity enables reconfigurable filtering by varying the cavity coupling rate. For instance, as opposed to the bandpass filter, we demonstrate a bandstop filter utilizing an under-coupled ring resonator. Such versatile integrated spectral filters with high extinction ratio and narrow linewidth could serve as fundamental components for optical signal processing and optical memories on-a-chip.
