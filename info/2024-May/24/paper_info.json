    "abstract": "           Interpreting scattered acoustic and electromagnetic wave patterns is a computational task that enables remote imaging in a number of important applications, including medical imaging, geophysical exploration, sonar and radar detection, and nondestructive testing of materials. However, accurately and stably recovering an inhomogeneous medium from far-field scattered wave measurements is a computationally difficult problem, due to the nonlinear and non-local nature of the forward scattering process. We design a neural network, called Multi-Frequency Inverse Scattering Network (MFISNet), and a training method to approximate the inverse map from far-field scattered wave measurements at multiple frequencies. We consider three variants of MFISNet, with the strongest performing variant inspired by the recursive linearization method -- a commonly used technique for stably inverting scattered wavefield data -- that progressively refines the estimate with higher frequency content.

    "abstract": "           Continuous aerosol monitoring in East Asia is essential due to the massive aerosol emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. Geostationary satellites enable continuous aerosol monitoring; however, the observation is limited to the daytime. This study proposed machine learning-based models to estimate daytime and nighttime aerosol optical depth (AOD) in East Asia using a geostationary satellite, Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A). The input variables for the machine learning models include the brightness temperature (BT) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from GK-2A, meteorological and geographical data, and auxiliary variables. The two models that used different combinations of GK-2A variables were proposed and compared: the all-day BT model, which estimates AOD during both day and night using BT variables, and the daytime TOA model, which estimates AOD during the day using TOA reflectance variables as well. The estimated AODs by the models were validated with ground-based AOD data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) by 10-fold cross-validation and hold-out validation methods. The performance of the daytime TOA model was slightly higher than the all-day BT model during the day (R2 = 0.80-0.82, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.107-0.116 for the all-day BT model, R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.098 for the daytime TOA model). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that total precipitable water content and seasonality contributed the most for both proposed models. BT differences and TOA reflectance variables were identified as the next most contributing variables for the all-day BT and daytime TOA models. The spatiotemporal distributions of estimated AODs from the proposed models show similar patterns compared with other AOD products. A time series comparison at a test station demonstrated that the estimated AOD of the proposed models was consistent with the AERONET AOD.         ",

    "abstract": "           We conduct systematic studies of the optical characteristics of plasmonic nanoparticles that exhibit C2v symmetry. We analyze three distinct geometric configurations: an L-type shape, a crescent, and a split-ring resonator. Optical properties are examined using the FDTD method. It is demonstrated that all three shapes exhibit two prominent plasmon bands associated with the two axes of symmetry. This is in addition to a wide range of resonances observed at high frequencies corresponding to quadrupole modes and peaks due to sharp corners. Next, to facilitate nonlinear analysis, we employ a semiclassical hydrodynamic model where the electron pressure term is explicitly accounted for. Employing this model enables us to rigorously examine the second-order angular resolved nonlinear optical response of these nanoparticles in each of the three configurations. For CW pumping, we explore properties of the SHG. Polarization and angle-resolved SHG spectra are obtained, revealing strong dependence on the nanoparticle geometry and incident wave polarization. For pulsed excitations, we discuss the phenomenon of broadband THz generation induced by the DFG. It is shown that the THz emission spectra exhibit unique features attributed to the plasmonic resonances and symmetry of the nanoparticles. The polarization of the generated THz waves is also examined, revealing interesting patterns tied to the nanoparticle geometry. To gain deeper insight, we propose a simple analytical theory that agrees very well with the numerical experiments. An expression for the far-field THz intensity is derived in terms of the incident pulse parameters and the nonlinear response tensor of the nanoparticle. The results presented in this work offer new insights into the linear and nonlinear optical properties of nanoparticles with C2v symmetry.         ",

This technique employs 30% and 24% hydrofluoric (HF) acid for the first and second steps, respectively. In the first step, a silica single-mode fiber with clad diameter of 125 um and core diameter of 10 um is immersed in the HF acid for 90 minutes. The resultant fiber diameter is reduced to 45 um. In the second step, such a fiber is again immersed in the HF acid for 60-80 minutes. The etching time is controlled to achieve the desired tip diameter of the ONFT. We characterize fabricated ONFTs by measuring optical transmission and surface morphology. The observed optical transmissions are more than 30% and tip diameters are less than 500 nm. The measured results readily reveal the merit of the employed technique as it is easy and cost-effective. Due to the strong confinement of the electromagnetic field at the tip of ONFTs, these structures lay versatile platforms with potential applications in sensing, photonics, and quantum optics.

The resulting band gap atlas show that binary systems may suffice for most applications but ternary systems may add additional flexibility in design if needed. Linear gratings show a regular pattern for all gaps studied, this regularity was able to be reproduced with only few materials involved. The position of the gaps showed a very monotonous behavior for all calculations performed. Finally, additional extensions of formulas commonly used in the design of Bragg mirrors/reflectors using binary materials were proposed with their corresponding limitations discussed.

Because of this, there is growing research interest in miniaturizing Raman probes to reach deep regions of the body. Typically, such probes utilize multiple optical fibers to act as separate excitation/collection channels with optical filters attached to the distal facet to separate the collected signal from the background optical signal from the probe itself. Although these probes have achieved impressive diagnostic performance, their use is limited by the overall size of the probe, which is typically several hundred micrometers to millimeters. Here, we show how a wavefront shaping technique can be used to measure Raman images through a single, hair thin multimode fiber. The wavefront shaping technique transforms the tip of the fiber to a sub-cellular spatial resolution Raman microscope. The resultant Raman images were analyzed with a variety of state-of-the-art statistical techniques including PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and k-means clustering. Our data-driven approach enables us to create high quality Raman images of microclusters of pharmaceuticals through a standard silica multimode optical fiber.         ",

In BSC light condenses into the fundamental fiber mode at elevated intensities. Despite extensive efforts utilizing optical thermodynamics to explain such counterintuitive beam reshaping process, several challenges still remain in fully understanding underlying physics. Here we provide compelling experimental evidence that BSC in a dissipative dual-core fiber can be understood in full analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases. Being ruled by the identical Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, both systems feature a Townes soliton solution, for which we find further evidence by modal decomposition of our experimental data. Specifically, we observe that efficient BSC only sets in after an initial thermalization phase, causing converge towards a Townes beam profile once a threshold intensity has been surpassed. This process is akin to a transition from classical to quantum-mechanical thermodynamics in BEC. Furthermore, our analysis also identifies dissipative processes as a crucial, yet previously unidentified component for efficient BSC in multimode fiber. This discovery paves the way for unprecedented applications of multimode-fiber based systems in ultrafast lasers, communications, and fiber-based delivery of high-power laser beams.         ",

    "abstract": "           Flow and heat transfer in a compressor rotating disc cavity with axial throughflow is investigated using wall-modelled large-eddy simulations (WMLES). These are compared to measurements from recently published experiments and used to investigate high Reynolds number effects. The simulations use an open-source CFD solver with high parallel efficiency and employ the Boussinesq approximation for centrifugal buoyancy. Kinetic energy effects (characterised by Eckert number) are accounted for by scaling the thermal boundary conditions from static temperature to rotary stagnation temperature. The WMLES shows very encouraging agreement with experiments up to the highest Reynolds number tested, $Re_\\phi=3.0\\times10^6$. A further simulation at $Re_\\phi=10^7$ extends the investigation to an operating condition more representative of aero engine high pressure compressors. The results support the scaling of shroud heat transfer found at lower $Re_\\phi$, but disc heat transfer is higher than expected from a simple extrapolation of lower $Re_\\phi$ results. This is associated with transition to turbulence in the disc Ekman layers and is consistent with the boundary layer Reynolds numbers at this condition. The introduction of swirl in the axial throughflow, as may occur at engine conditions, could reduce the boundary layer Reynolds numbers and delay the transition.         ",

We reveal that this effect occurs when a vortex beam is observed from a tilted reference frame free of wave-interface interactions or gradient-index media needed for observing conventional ones, and can be amplified by simply binding the beam tightly. Thanks to this mechanism, large transverse shifts proportional to angular momentum are observed in a compact system.

Due to the different physical mechanisms, there is not yet a solution that can effectively suppress the frequency shifts induced by these two effects. Here, we propose a 'resonance-offset' locking approach that compensates for the two physical frequency shifts. In this approach, the additional offset locking shift can effectively counteract the atomic resonance shifts arising from changes in vapor-cell temperature and light power, reducing the net impact on the clock's frequency to nearly zero. We have demonstrated this strategy on the 778 nm Rubidium two-photon optical frequency standard, successfully compensating for light shift and cell-temperature shift, respectively. This general method is particularly appealing for compact vapor-cell microwave and optical atomic clocks designed for the excellent stability rather than accuracy.         ",

    "abstract": "           Substantial efforts have been devoted to the elaborate component and microstructure design of absorbents (inclusions) in microwave absorbing (MA) composite materials. However, mesoscopic architectures of composites also play significant roles in prescribing their electromagnetic properties, which are rarely explored in studies of MA materials. Herein, a composite containing randomly distributed ZrB2 particles is fabricated to offer a mesoscopic cluster configuration, which produces a novel dielectric resonance. The resonance disappears and reoccurs when ZrB2 is coated with the insulating and semiconductive ZrO2 layer respectively, suggesting that it is a plasmon resonance excited by the electron transport between ZrB2 particles in clusters rather than any intrinsic resonances of materials constituting the composite. The resonance strength can be regulated by controlling the quantity of the electron transport between particles, which is accomplished by gradually increasing the insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2 ratio x to disturb the electron transport in ternary disordered composites containing ZrB2 and insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2. When x exceeds 0.7, the electron transport is cut off completely and the resonance thus disappears. The resonance induces unusual double quarter-wavelength interference cancellations or resonance absorption coupled with quarter-wavelength interference cancellation, giving rise to continuous dual-peak absorption. This work highlights the significance of mesoscopic architectures of composites in MA material design, which can be exploited to prescribe novel electromagnetic properties.         ",

Recently, there have been proposals for utilizing waveguide lattices to implement quantum gates, providing a more compact and robust solution compared to discrete implementation with directional couplers and phase shifters. We report on the first demonstration of precise control of single photon states on an $11\\times 11$ continuously-coupled programmable waveguide array. Through electro-optical control, the array is subdivided into decoupled subcircuits and the degree of on-chip quantum interference can be tuned with a maximum visibility of 0.962$\\pm$0.013. Furthermore, we show simultaneous control of two subcircuits on a single device. Our results demonstrate the potential of using this technology as a building block for quantum information processing applications.         ",

For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \\times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \\times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.

Trapped ions present a natural platform for the quantum simulation of such models; however, previous experiments have been limited to simulating a scenario where a spin is coherently coupled to bosonic modes, which neglects capturing the dissipation of the bath. In our work, we perform quantum simulations of spin-boson models with structured baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to the control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with spectral densities composed of up to three Lorentzian peaks. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, suggesting the advantage of adding the trapped-ion system's experimental noise for simulating open quantum systems.         ",

This paper develops an answer by interrogating the assumption that observations need to be recorded and communicated using the language of classical physics. Niels Bohr held this assumption even though he recognized the fact that quantum phenomena cannot be analyzed on classical lines. Classical analysis requires the objectification of whatever is being observed so that it can be objectively described. Inherent in this analysis is the intellectual creation of a transcendental verity, a view from nowhere. In contrast, knowledge systems that predate European colonialism make use of the quantum nature of nature without constructing an objective model of it. This paper concludes that uncolonized knowledge systems differ from classical ones in that they are epistemically plural, accepting multiple true observations of the same phenomenon.         ",

    "abstract": "           This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model to investigate whether the ability of two quantum entangled particles to \"correlate\" their behaviors even at very large distances and in the absence of any physical connection can be seen as due to an exchange of information through an extra-temporal dimension. Since superluminal information exchange is forbidden in our (3,1) spacetime, an extra-temporal dimension is needed to recover the physical picture of finite velocity information exchange between entangled entities. Assuming that the geometry of space-time of dimension (3,2) is described by a metric containing a warping factor, the confinement of the massive particles in the extra time dimension follows. Therefore, why we do not experience an infinitely large extra time dimension can be explained. The toy model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wavefunction collapse using nonlinear (non-unitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model so obtained is just speculative without any claim of being robust against any criticism, nevertheless, it satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be verified experimentally; in fact, it proposes an experiment potentially interesting which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful.         ",

Recent research has indicated the importance of teachers enthusing students about the topic of quantum physics. Therefore, educators at both high school and early university level need to find engaging and perhaps unorthodox ways of teaching complex, yet interesting topics such as quantum teleportation. In this paper, we present a paradigm to teach the concept of quantum teleportation using the Christmas gift-bringer Santa Claus. Using the example of Santa Claus, we use an unusual context to explore the key aspects of quantum teleportation, and all without being overly abstract. In addition, we outline a worksheet designed for use in the classroom setting which is based on common naive conceptions from quantum physics. This worksheet will be evaluated as a classroom resource to teach quantum teleportation in a subsequent study.         ",

This paper proposes an approach to extending the functionality of a standard magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by introducing an additional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (FM/AFM) storage layer (SL) vertically integrated with the standard Vortex MTJ stack into the nanopillar. The magnetostatic field created by this storage layer acts on the free layer and can be used to change its static and dynamic properties. To tune the magnitude and direction of this magnetostatic field, magnetic reconfiguration is carried out through a thermally assisted switching mechanism using a voltage pulse that heats the AFM layer in the SL above the Neel temperature in the presence of an external field. It is experimentally shown that using an MTJ based on a 600 nm diameter nanopillar with a vortex in the free layer, reconfiguration of the SL allows to continuously change the core precession frequency in the 15 MHz range. The reconfigurable analogue storage layer locally affects both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ free layer, demonstrating vertical 3D integration of additional functionalities into a single MTJ nanopillar.

We derive and classify several analytic interference conditions for single-channel RESI in arbitrary driving fields, and address specific issues for few-cycle pulses.

We quantify this dominance for single excitation channels by proposing a dominance parameter.

It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova & Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations.

The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states.

It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum-metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such a subspace effective field theory for interacting, spin carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies, including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum clock interferometry.

While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives.

We achieved this breakthrough by building a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.
