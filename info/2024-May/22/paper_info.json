    "abstract": "           The generation of shaped laser beams, or structured light, is of interest in a wide range of fields, from microscopy to fundamental physics. There are several ways to make shaped beams, most commonly using spatial light modulators comprised of pixels of liquid crystals. These methods have limitations on the wavelength, pulse duration, and average power that can be used. Here we present a method to generate shaped light that can be used at any wavelength from the UV to IR, on ultrafast pulses, and a large range of optical powers. By exploiting the frequency difference between higher order modes, a result of the Gouy phase, and cavity mode matching, we can selectively couple into a variety of pure and composite higher order modes. Optical cavities are used as a spatial filter and then combined with sum frequency generation in a nonlinear crystal as the output coupler to the cavity to create ultrafast, frequency comb structured light.

    "abstract": "           Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.

Here, we numerically demonstrate that Raman solitons can exist even under conditions of continuous wave driving, and by numerically examining the existence and characteristics of Raman solitons under such conditions, we elucidate the role of desynchronisation in pulse-driven systems. In addition to providing new insights on the existence and characteristics of ultrashort Raman solitons, our analysis yields a qualitative explanation for the range of desynchronisations over which the solitons can exist.

These range from quantum sensors for magnetic fields, interferometers for gravimetry measurements, to quantum computing and simulations. Within this technological landscape, reliable laser systems are crucial in order to cool and manipulate atoms efficiently. We present the design, experimental realization and characterization of a relatively simple, compact, and economical laser system for quantum technology applications. It operates at 780 nm in order to work with Rubidium atoms, and it is entirely based on fiber components. This improves its reliability, and makes it less complex and more versatile with respect to a free-space system. In order to cut costs, we take advantage of already available commercial fiber devices at 1560 nm: due to their ubiquity in telecom applications they are in fact cheap and standardized. To operate at Rubidium wavelengths the system employs Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) of the 1560 nm infrared radiation: two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm (one for cooling, one for repumping) are combined, amplified in an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), and frequency-doubled in a Periodically-Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal. We characterize the amplitude stability of the lasers, their frequency noise, and the SHG efficiency. The measured features (rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s; linewidths well below 1 MHz) make our system a suitable candidate for applications in quantum sensors and atom interferometers.

While the gas phase was the playground of early efforts in atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics, we have only recently demonstrated the formation of molecular polaritons under these conditions. Studying the reactivity of isolated gas-phase molecules under strong coupling would eliminate solvent interactions and enable quantum state resolution of reaction progress.

The scheme utilises cavity QED effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a new quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.

This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for denoising medical images, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process, resulting in compression of imaging modes by over 70 percent. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is a standalone algorithm with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating its potential to achieve quantum-level performance without heavy reliance on classical algorithms. Through experimental validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for current and future quantum computing applications.

In this work we explore the phenomenon of operator spreading in quantum simulation of electronic structure in quantum computers. To substantiate our results, we focus on a hydrogen chain $H_4$ and demonstrate that operator spreading is enhanced when the chain is far from its equilibrium geometry. We also investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglement and its dependence on the partition's size. Our findings reveal distinctive signatures closely resembling area- and volume-laws in equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium geometries, respectively. Our results provide insight of operator spreading of coherent errors in quantum simulation of electronic structure and can be experimentally implemented in various platforms available today.

Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows a remarkable exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. Surprisingly, this measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.         ",

Photonic integrated circuits (PIC) has demonstrated promising potentials in terms of low latency and low power consumption per operation for linear operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. However, the existing schemes face challenges in their scalability due to the use of photonic circuits that expand with the scale of the operants, despite efforts of exploiting the multiple optical parameter dimensions such as time, wavelength and spatial parallelism. They also lacked flexibility and efficiency in switching between different types of operations or tasks and adapting to multimodal data. In this article, we introduce an optical matrix processor (MP) with a minimalistic recursive structure for both multiplications and accumulations. The MP consists of an eletro-optic ring-modulator implemented as a thin-film lithium niobate PIC that allows flexible configurability and time-division multiplexed scheduling. The MP supports not only versatile linear operations including vector/matrix-vector multiplication and single/multi-kernel convolution but also ultrafast task switching and adaptability to data of different sizes, by simply adjusting the data baud rate relative to the ring delay without structural modifications. We demonstrate its capabilities in a optic-electronic convolutional neural network with a computing throughput up to 73.4 billion operations per second. The MP further supports high scalability through appropriate allocation of wavelength and space resources,extending computing parallelism to handle higher data volumes with higher energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "           Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           I argue that the rules of unitary quantum mechanics imply that observers who will themselves be subject to measurements in a linear combination of macroscopic states (``cat\" measurements) cannot make reliable predictions on the results of experiments performed after such measurements. This lifts the inconsistency in the interpretation of quantum mechanics recently identified by Frauchiger and Renner. The Born rules for calculating the probability of outcomes and for communicating with other observers do not generally apply for cat-measured observers, nor can they generally be amended to incorporate upcoming cat measurements. Quantum mechanical rules completed with these conditions become fully consistent.         ",

    "title": "Transfer learning-assisted inverse modeling in nanophotonics based on mixture density networks",
    "abstract": "           The simulation of nanophotonic structures relies on electromagnetic solvers, which play a crucial role in understanding their behavior. However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can be numerically unstable and can lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach allows overcoming these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while preserving a high accuracy in the prediction capability of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose a new model-independent method for new physics searches called Cluster Scanning. It uses the k-means algorithm to perform clustering in the space of low-level event or jet observables, and separates potentially anomalous clusters to construct a signal-enriched region. The spectra of a selected observable (e.g. invariant mass) in these two regions are then used to determine whether a resonant signal is present. A pseudo-analysis on the LHC Olympics dataset with a $Z'$ resonance shows that Cluster Scanning outperforms the widely used 4-parameter functional background fitting procedures, reducing the number of signal events needed to reach a $3\\sigma$ significant access by a factor of 0.61. Emphasis is placed on the speed of the method, which allows the test statistic to be calibrated on synthetic data.         ",

    "abstract": "           Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.         ",

The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\\to [ODD]^{\\#} \\to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \\to [ArHCl]^{\\#} \\to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.         ",
