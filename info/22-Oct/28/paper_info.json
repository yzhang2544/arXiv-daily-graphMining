    "title": "Examining the origins of observed terahertz modes from an optically  pumped atomistic model protein in aqueous solution",
    "abstract": "The microscopic origins of terahertz (THz) vibrational modes in biological systems are an active and open area of current research. Recent experiments [Physical Review X 8, 031061 (2018)] have revealed the presence of a pronounced mode at $\\sim$0.3 THz in fluorophore-decorated bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein in aqueous solution under nonequilibrium conditions induced by optical pumping. This result was heuristically interpreted as a collective elastic fluctuation originating from the activation of a low-frequency phonon mode. In this work, we show that the sub-THz spectroscopic response emerges in a statistically significant manner (> 2$\\sigma$) from such collective behavior, illustrating how specific THz vibrational modes can be triggered through optical excitations and other charge reorganization processes. We revisit the theoretical analysis with proof-of-concept molecular dynamics that introduce optical excitations into the simulations. Using information theory techniques, we show that these excitations can induce a multiscale response involving the two optically excited chromophores (tryptophans), other amino acids in the protein, ions, and water. Our results motivate new experiments and fully nonequilibrium simulations to probe these phenomena, as well as the refinement of atomistic models of Fr\\\"ohlich condensates that are fundamentally determined by nonlinear interactions in biology.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new technique named Latent CATHODE (LaCATHODE) for performing \"enhanced bump hunts\", a type of resonant anomaly search that combines conventional one-dimensional bump hunts with a model-agnostic anomaly score in an auxiliary feature space where potential signals could also be localized. The main advantage of LaCATHODE over existing methods is that it provides an anomaly score that is well behaved when evaluating it beyond the signal region, which is essential to prevent the sculpting of background distributions in the bump hunt. LaCATHODE accomplishes this by constructing the anomaly score directly in the latent space learned by a conditional normalizing flow trained on sideband regions. We demonstrate the superior stability and comparable performance of LaCATHODE for enhanced bump hunting in an illustrative toy example as well as on the LHC Olympics R&D dataset. ",

    "abstract": "We study the propagation of structured optical scalar beams in a spacetime background parameterized by a second-rank symmetric tensor. An analytic expression for the Green's function in a cylindrical coordinate system is obtained for particular choices of such a tensor. This facilitates the numerical exploration of the propagation of apertured Gaussian beams in this nontrivial background. Unusual focusing properties are found along with a decrease in the Gouy phase compared to that in standard vacuum. In the case of apertured Bessel beams, the medium allows to overcome finite aperture effects so that the corresponding diffraction length is increased; besides, the central spot of a zero order Bessel concentrates an increased fraction of the energy of the beam. Multiple scenarios beyond an electromagnetic field in the presence of an anisotropic medium could support the results reported here. They include a bosonic field in a weak gravitational field or a nontrivial spacetime background arising from Lorentz symmetry breaking. In particular, our results could illustrate how optically transparent multiferroic materials offer unprecedented opportunities to tailor structured beam propagation, as well as to simulate nontrivial spacetime backgrounds.

    "abstract": "We study the onset of electron heating in intense laser-solid interactions and its impact on the spectral quality of radiation pressure accelerated ions in both hole boring and light sail regimes. Two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed over a wide range of laser and target parameters and reveal how the pulse duration, profile, polarization, and target surface stability control the electron heating, the dominant ion acceleration mechanisms, and the ion spectra. We find that the onset of strong electron heating is associated with the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability at the front surface and must be controlled to produce high-quality ion beams, even when circularly polarized lasers are employed. We define a threshold condition for the maximum duration of the laser pulse that allows mitigation of electron heating and radiation pressure acceleration of narrow energy spread ion beams. The model is validated by three-dimensional PIC simulations, and the few experimental studies that reported low energy spread radiation pressure accelerated ion beams appear to meet the derived criteria. The understanding provided by our work will be important in guiding future experimental developments, for example for the ultrashort laser pulses becoming available at state-of-the-art laser facilities, for which we predict that proton beams with ~150 - 250 MeV, ~30% energy spread, and a total laser-to-proton conversion efficiency of ~20% can be produced.

    "abstract": "Blu-ray drive is an engineering masterpiece that integrates disc rotation, pickup head translation, and three lasers in a compact and portable format. Here we integrate a blood-coated image sensor with a modified Blu-ray drive for high-throughput cytometric analysis of various bio-specimens. In this device, samples are mounted on the rotating Blu-ray disc and illuminated by the built-in lasers from the pickup head. The resulting coherent diffraction patterns are then recorded by the blood-coated image sensor. The rich spatial features of the blood-cell monolayer help down-modulate the object information for sensor detection, thus forming a high-resolution computational bio-lens with a theoretically unlimited field of view. With the acquired data, we develop a lensless coherent diffraction imaging modality termed rotational ptychography for image reconstruction. We show that our device can resolve the 435 nm linewidth on the resolution target and has a field of view only limited by the size of the Blu-ray disc. To demonstrate its applications, we perform high-throughput urinalysis by locating disease-related calcium oxalate crystals over the entire microscope slide. We also quantify different types of cells on a blood smear with an acquisition speed of ~10,000 cells per second. For in vitro experiment, we monitor live bacterial cultures over the entire Petri dish with single-cell resolution. Using biological cells as a computational lens could enable new intriguing imaging devices for point-of-care diagnostics. Modifying a Blu-ray drive with the blood-coated sensor further allows the spread of high-throughput optical microscopy from well-equipped laboratories to citizen scientists worldwide. ",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a closed-loop light-pulse atom-interferometer inertial sensor, which can realize continuous decoupling measurements of acceleration and rotation. The sensor works in a differential mode of double-loop atom interferometers, which share same Raman light pulses into spatially separated Mach-Zehnder configuration and have continuous cold atomic beam sources propagating in opposite directions from two 2D$^+$ Magneto-Optical Trappings. By phase-locking interferometers via Raman laser phases from the differential interferometer signal, decoupled acceleration phase shift and rotation phase shift are obtained simultaneously. Experimental results show that the differential detection suppresses the common-mode noise and increases sensitivity to about 1.5 times higher than that of a single atom interferometer, and the closed-loop phase-locking method effectively improves the long-term stability of the sensor. We achieve long-term stabilities of acceleration and rotation rate at 110 ng and 32 $\\mu$rad/s respectively with a short interrogation time of 0.95ms (interference area $A=0.11$ mm$^2$). This work provides a building block for atom-interferometer inertial measurement unit in field applications requiring high data-rate and stability. ",

    "abstract": "Formation of a splash crown and a cavity following the impact of a sphere on a body of liquid is a classical problem. In the related problem of a droplet splashing on a flat surface, it has been established that the properties of the surrounding gas can influence the splashing threshold. At lower impact speeds, this is due mainly to the influence of gas kinetic effects, since the height of the gas lubrication film which is displaced during dynamic wetting is often comparable to the mean free path of the gas. At higher Weber and Reynolds numbers, on the other hand, inertial effects dominate and the density of the gas becomes important in determining whether a splash occurs. In this article, sphere impacts on a liquid body are investigated in a rarefied atmosphere using high-speed photography. It is found that the threshold entry speed for cavity formation is influenced by the density of the surrounding gas, whereas changing the mean free path of the gas has no effect. We attribute this phenomenon to the gas slowing the sealing of the thin crown sheet behind the sphere. This assertion is supported with experimental measurements of the liquid sheet thickness. In the range of parameters considered, the splash crown influences the movement of the contact line, an effect not previously observed. ",

We discuss the formation of this soliton and the transition towards a droplet regime that occurs when the number of atoms in the minority component is increased.

    "abstract": "To assess the potential optoelectronic applications of metal-halide perovskites, it is critical to have a detailed understanding of the nature, strength, and dynamics of the interactions between carriers and the polar lattices. Here, we report the electronic and structural dynamics of bismuth-based perovskite $\\textrm{Cs}_{3}\\textrm{Bi}_{2}\\textrm{I}_{9}$ revealed by transient reflectivity and ultrafast electron diffraction. A cross-examination of these experimental results combined with theoretical analyses allows the identification of the major carrier-phonon coupling mechanism and the associated time scales. It is found that carriers photoinjected into $\\textrm{Cs}_{3}\\textrm{Bi}_{2}\\textrm{I}_{9}$ form self-trapped excitons on an ultrafast time scale. However, they retain most of their energy and their coupling to Fr\\\"ohlich-type optical phonons is limited at early times. Instead, the long-lived excitons exert an electronic stress via deformation potential and develop a prominent, sustaining strain field as coherent acoustic phonons in 10 ps. From sub-ps to ns and beyond, a similar extent of the atomic displacements is found throughout the different stages of structural distortions, from limited local modulations to a coherent strain field to the Debye-Waller random atomic motions on longer times. The current results suggest the potential use of bismuth-based perovskites for applications other than photovoltaics to take advantage of carriers' stronger self-trapping and long lifetime. ",
