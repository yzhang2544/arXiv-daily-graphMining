    "title": "Thermodynamic optical pressures in tight-binding nonlinear multimode  photonic systems",
    "abstract": "Optical forces are known to arise in a universal fashion in many and diverse physical settings. As such, they are successfully employed over a wide range of applications in areas like biophotonics, optomechanics and integrated optics. While inter-elemental optical forces in few-mode photonic networks have been so far systematically analyzed, little is known, if any, as to how they manifest themselves in highly multimoded optical environments. In this work, by means of statistical mechanics, we formally address this open problem in optically thermalized weakly nonlinear heavily multimode tight-binding networks. The outlined thermodynamic formulation allows one to obtain in an elegant manner analytical results for the exerted thermodynamic pressures in utterly complex arrangements-results that are either computationally intensive or impossible to obtain otherwise. Thus, we derive simple closed-form expressions for the thermodynamic optical pressures displayed among elements, which depend only on the internal energy as well as the coupling coefficients involved. In all cases, our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with numerical computations. Our study may pave the way towards a deeper understanding of these complex processes and could open up avenues in harnessing radiation forces in multimode optomechanical systems. ",

However, such an approach is not easily scalable to other frequency regimes. Here, we design a space-time-coding digital metasurface operating in microwave frequencies to experimentally generate different modes of time-varying OAM. We also introduce a concept of superhelicity of time-varying OAM with a higher-order twist of the wavefront structure, which can be further realized by reflection phase profiles nonlinear in time through the metasurface. By developing a two-probe measurement technique, we dynamically map the OAM field pattern varying in time. The proposed superhelical time-varying OAM beam paves a way for particle manipulations and OAM multiplexing communications. ",

    "title": "Holistic nanowire laser characterization as a route to optimal design",
    "abstract": "Nanowire lasers are sought for near-field and on-chip photonic applications as they provide integrable, coherent and monochromatic radiation. A wavelength-scale nanowire acts as both the gain medium and the cavity for the lasing action: the functional performance (threshold and wavelength) is therefore dependent on both the opto-electronic and crystallographic properties of each nanowire. However, scalable bottom-up manufacturing techniques often suffer from inter-nanowire variation, leading to, often dramatic, differences in yield and performance between individual nanowires. Establishing the relationship between manufacturing controls, geometric and material properties and the lasing performance is a crucial step towards optimisation, however, this is challenging to achieve experimentally due to the complex interdependance of such properties. Here, we present a high-throughput correlative approach to characterise over 5000 individual GaAsP/GaAs multiple quantum well nanowire lasers. Fitting the spontaneous emission provides the threshold carrier density, while coherence length measurements measures end-facet reflectivity. We show that the lasing wavelength and threshold are intrinsically related to the width of a single quantum well due to quantum confinement and bandfilling effects. Unexpectedly, there is no strong relationship between the properties of the lasing cavity (facet reflectivity and distributed losses) and the threshold: instead the threshold is negatively correlated with the non-radiative recombination lifetime of the carriers. This approach therefore provides an optimisation strategy that is not accessible through small-scale studies. The quality and width of the quantum wells limit the threshold of these nanowire lasers, rather than the cavity quality. ",

    "abstract": "Energy self sufficiency, as well as optimal management of power in buildings is gaining importance, while obtaining power from traditional fossil energy sources is becoming more and more expensive. In this context, millimeter scale metasurfaces can be employed to harvest energy from microwave sources. They can also be used as sensors in the microwave regime for efficient power management solutions. In the current study, a simple spray printing method is proposed to develop metasurfaces in construction materials, i.e., plasterboard and wood. Such materials are used in the interior design of buildings; therefore, the implementation of metasurfaces in large areas, such as walls, doors and floors, is realized. The fabricated metasurfaces were characterized regarding their electromagnetic performance. It is hereby shown that the investigated metasurfaces exhibit an efficient electromagnetic response in the frequency range 4 to 7 GHz, depending on the MS. Thus, spray printed metasurfaces integrated on construction materials can potentially be used for electromagnetic applications, for buildings power self efficiency and management. ",

Here we demonstrate a non-volatile optical phase shifter by driving a III-V/Si hybrid metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) phase shifter with a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) operating in the source follower mode. Owing to the various polarization states in the FeFET, we obtained multistate non-volatile phase shifts up to 1.25{\\pi} with a CMOS-compatible operation voltage. Furthermore, we proposed a crossbar array architecture to simplify their controls in large-scale PICs and verified its feasibility by confirming the selective write-in operation of a targeted FeFET with a negligible disturbance to the others.

    "abstract": "The 2 {\\mu}m waveband is an area that could have significant technological consequences, with applications ranging from spectroscopy, LIDAR and free-space communications. The development of the thulium-doped fiber amplifier, hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber and 2 {\\mu}m GaSb-based diode lasers has highlighted the ability of the waveband in alleviating the fiber capacity crisis in the incumbent communication infrastructure. The above has initiated vibrant development in the silicon photonic-space at 2 {\\mu}m, where the area is capable of enabling highly-integrated photonic circuits, and potentially at low-cost and high-volumes. However, as of now, modulator linearity at 2 {\\mu}m has not been addressed. The metric, as characterized by spurious free dynamic range is imperative for numerous applications such as RF photonic links for 5G and digital analog transmission in coherent communications. The development of linear optical modulators will be crucial in bringing these applications to the 2 {\\mu}m. In view of that, this work is the first to address modulator linearity at the 2 {\\mu}m, where the ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder modulator is developed, indicating spurious free dynamic range as high as 95 dB.Hz^2/3. It is found that that modulator spurious free dynamic range has a strong dependence on modulator bias voltage where it impacts the linearity of the transfer function in which the input RF signal is applied upon. The demonstrated modulator indicates favorable performance within silicon photonic modulators developed at 2 {\\mu}m with bandwidth exceeding 17.5 GHz and modulation efficiency ranging from 0.70 to 1.25 V.cm.

The study rests on a model that consists of the Lugiato-Lefever equation, coupled to the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation with a source term proportional to the average power of the optical field. Using appropriate variable changes the model equations are transformed into a set of coupled first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically with emphasis on the influence of thermo-optic effects on the amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the optical field, as well as on the temperature profile in the microresonator cavity. It is found that thermo-optic effects do not prevent soliton crytals from forming in optical Kerr microresonators, however, a strong thermal detuning will decrease the soliton-crystal amplitude. The model predicts a temperature profile in the microresonator cavity which is insensitive to the specific spatio-temporal profile of the soliton crystal propagating in the microresonator, a feature peculiar to the model.

Exciting experimental progress has been achieved by either introducing spatial-temporal modulation of the optical medium or combining Kerr-type optical nonlinearity with spatial asymmetry in photonic structures. However, extra driving fields are required for the first approach, while the isolation of noise and the transmission of the signal cannot be simultaneously achieved for the other approach. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a new concept of nonlinear non-reciprocal susceptibility for optical media and realize the completely passive isolation of optical signals without any external bias field. The self-induced isolation by the input signal is demonstrated with an extremely high isolation ratio of 63.4 dB, a bandwidth of 2.1 GHz for 60 dB isolation, and a low insertion loss of around 1 dB. Furthermore, novel functional optical devices are realized, including polarization purification and non-reciprocal leverage. The demonstrated nonlinear non-reciprocity provides a versatile tool to control light and deepen our understanding of light-matter interactions, and enables applications ranging from topological photonics to unidirectional quantum information transfer in a network.

In this paper, we focus on the performance of IGA and apply the recently-developed softIGA to reduce the spectral errors of the low-energy bound states. The main idea is to add high-order derivative-jump terms with a penalty parameter to the IGA bilinear forms. With an optimal choice of the penalty parameter, we observe eigenvalue error superconvergence. We focus on linear (finite elements) and quadratic elements and demonstrate the outperformance of softIGA over IGA through a variety of examples including both two- and three-body problems in 1D. ",

We solve a 512-armed bandit problem online, which is much larger than previous experiments by two orders of magnitude. The scaling property for correct decision making is examined as a function of the number of slot machines, evaluated as an exponent of 0.86.
