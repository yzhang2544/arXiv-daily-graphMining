    "abstract": "Here we investigate the use of passive intracavity optical filters for controlling the laser output spectrum of a polarization-mode-locked, ultrafast Ytterbium fiber laser. With strategic placement of the filter cutoff frequency, the overall lasing bandwidth can be increased or extended. Overall laser performance, including pulse compression and intensity noise, is investigated for both shortpass and longpass filters with a range of cutoff frequencies, tuned by rotating the filters. We demonstrate the use of an intracavity filter not only shapes the output spectra, it provides a route for overall broader bandwidths and shorter pulses in Yb:fiber lasers. These results demonstrate that spectral shaping is a useful tool to routinely achieve sub-45 fs pulse durations in Yb:fiber lasers. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, nonlinear optical (NLO) studies of nickel oxide doped (ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mol%) Li2SO4-MgO-P2O5 glasses are reported. A combination of femtosecond (fs) laser, as a pumping light source and a high-accuracy polarimeter with low power probing laser, is used to investigate the light-induced optical anisotropy (OA) in these glass materials. The light-induced birefringence (LIB) exhibits slow relaxation tendency up to about 10 s suggesting on anisotropic photorefractive effect evidently dominated fast Kerr effect. This behavior is evaluated in the light of other results reported recently and is explained by the glass polymerization mechanisms. The photorefractive birefringence increases with increase of the quantity of NiO up to 0.8 mol% and it is attributed to the enhanced degree of depolymerization of the glass network due to the hike in the concentration of Ni2+ ions that occupy octahedral (Oh) positions. Further increase of NiO content (>0.8 mol%) causes, however, a certain decrease of the photorefractive birefringence. Notable change in concentration trend is interpreted by rising of phonon losses due to increasing portion of the nickel ions occupying tetrahedral (Th) sites that facilitates the polymerization of the glass network. The doped glasses with the NiO content of about 0.8 mol% may be considered as optimal in the sense of photorefractive efficiency. Relevant samples exhibit largest magnitudes of the photorefractive birefringence and appear to be favorable for potential applications. ",

Photonic crystal cavities in 4H-silicon carbide serve as a nanoscope monitoring silicon monovacancy (V$_{Si}^-$) defect formation within the $100~\\text{nm}^3$ cavity mode volume. We observe defect spin resonance, cavity-integrated photoluminescence and excited-state lifetimes consistent with conventional defect formation methods, without need for post-irradiation thermal annealing. We further find an exponential reduction in excited-state lifetime at fluences approaching the cavity amorphization threshold, and show single-shot local annealing of the intrinsic background defects at the V$_{Si}^-$ formation sites. This real-time in-situ method of localized defect formation, paired with demonstration of cavity-integrated defect spins, marks an important step in engineering cavity-emitter coupling for quantum networking.

The nanofabrication techniques used for fabricating these devices often lack flexibility. While photolithography requires printing of an expensive photomask for each new design iteration, electron-beam lithography is extremely slow and commands high equipment cost. Here we demonstrate maskless rapid prototyping of freestanding SiN nanomechanical resonators fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation of plain SiN membrane in ambient air. We fabricate microbeams with different widths from 7 to 100 um, and we characterize their resonance frequency and mechanical quality (Q) factors. We find that membrane cracking can be avoided during fabrication by carefully engineering the etch pattern, and that laser etching has a negligible effect on built-in tensile stress. For each beam, Q-factors are measured for several eigenmodes and are found to remain high after laser etching. All beams show quality factors greater than 105, while unetched plain membranes have Q > 106. Possible causes for Q-factor reduction are identified, along with future process improvement directions.

    "abstract": "Fundamental effects in nanophotonic resonance systems focused on singular states and their properties are presented. Strongly related to lattice geometry and material composition, there appear resonant bright channels and non-resonant dark channels in the spectra. The bright state corresponds to high reflectivity guided-mode resonance (GMR) whereas the dark channel represents a bound state in the continuum (BIC). Even in simple systems, singular states with tunable bandwidth appear as isolated spectral lines that are widely separated from other resonance features. Under moderate lattice modulation, there ensues leaky-band metamorphosis, merging modal bands and resulting in offset dark states and reflective BICs along with transmissive BICs within a high-reflectance wideband. Rytov-type effective medium theory (EMT) is shown to be a powerful means to describe, formulate, and understand the collective GMR/BIC fundamentals in resonant photonic systems. Particularly, the discarded Rytov analytical solution for asymmetric fields is shown here to predict the dark BIC states essentially exactly for considerable modulation levels. The propagation constant of an equivalent EMT homogeneous film provides a quantitative evaluation of the eminent, oft-cited embedded BIC eigenvalue. The work concludes with experimental verification of key effects. ",

Along with the proposed circuit model, accurate spatial profiles for square and circular apertures are presented in which the transverse components of the electric field are approximated. In this paper, it is shown that structures such as an array of PEC pillars can be analyzed similar to other arrays of apertures, and the circuit model accurately predicts the behavior of these structures. In some practical applications, such as sensors and TCEs (transparent conducting electrodes), the array is embedded in a layered medium, and the circuit model with minor changes and few modifications can analyze these structures with high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Real-time in-line interpretation of liquid properties is important for multiphase flow measurements. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a sensor, such as a microwave sensor, which can continuously measure the salinity of a flow. In addition to salinity measurement, the microwave sensor can also measure water fraction, which is required for a multiphase flowmeter based on single-energy gamma-ray attenuation; however, choosing a suitable probe sensing location for a microwave salinity sensor in a multiphase flowmeter can be challenging, as the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich region to accommodate a wide range of flow conditions. Currently, a microwave sensor is installed in the lower area of a horizontal blind-tee inlet spool of a multiphase flowmeter for salinity measurement. Integrating the microwave sensor into the vertically mounted multiphase flowmeter can reduce the flowmeter (carbon) footprint and manufacturing costs and can improve water-to-liquid ratio measurement due to faster local oil-water mixing. The associated challenge is that the sensor needs to be located at near-wall liquid-rich region to accommodate a wide range of flow conditions, including high gas-volume-fraction flows, where the near-wall liquid layer present in the vertical pipe is usually very thin. In this study, computational fluid dynamics modeling is used to evaluate the suitability of four different sensing locations along the vertical cross-section of a Venturi-based multiphase flowmeter based on near-wall liquid-richness. The results show that the Venturi inlet is the most suitable location for microwave sensor measurement, compared to the mid-convergence section, the mid-divergence section, and the Venturi outlet for a range of inlet liquid-volume-fractions. The findings have been validated by experimental microwave sensor measurements in a multiphase flow loop facility. ",

    "abstract": "Bonded permanent magnets are key components in many energy conversion, sensor and actuator devices. These applications require high magnetic performance and freedom of shape. With additive manufacturing processes, for example laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), it is possible to produce bonded magnets with customized stray field distribution. Up to now, most studies use spherical powders as magnetic fillers due to their good flowability. Here, the behavior of large SmFeN platelets with a high aspect ratio as filler material and its influence on the arrangement and the resulting magnetic properties are examined in comparison to a spherical magnetic filler. The 3D distribution and orientation of the magnetic filler was studied by computed tomography and digital image analysis. The platelet-shaped particles align themselves perpendicular to the buildup direction during the process, which offers a new and cost-effective way of producing composites by LPBF with anisotropic structural and functional properties. The influence of LPBF parameters on the properties of the composites is investigated. Highest filling fractions are required for high magnetic remanence, however the powder itself limits this maximum due to particle shape and required minimal polymer fraction to form mechanically stable magnets. The coercivity decreases for higher filling fractions, which is attributed to increased rotation of insufficiently embedded magnetic particles in the matrix. It is discussed how filler morphology influences the observed change in coercivity since the rotation of spherical particles in comparison to platelet-shaped particles requires less energy. Our work shows the challenges and opportunities of large platelet shaped fillers used in LPBF for the production of anisotropic functional and structural composites. ",

    "abstract": "DSP (digital signal processing) has been widely applied in optical communication systems to mitigate signal distortions and has become one of the key technologies that have sustained data traffic growth over the past decade. However, the strict energy budget of application-specific integrated circuit-based DSP chips has prevented the deployment of some powerful but computationally costly DSP algorithms. As a result, fiber nonlinearity-induced signal distortions impede fiber communications systems, especially in wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) transmission systems. To solve these challenges, photonics hardware (i.e., photonic neural networks) promises to break performance limitations in electronics and gain advantages in bandwidth, latency, and power consumption in solving intellectual tasks that are unreachable by conventional digital electronic platforms. This work proposes a photonic recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of simultaneously resolving dispersion and both intra and inter-channel fiber nonlinearities in multiple WDM channels in the photonic domain, for the first time to our best knowledge. Furthermore, our photonic RNN can directly process optical WDM signals in the photonic domain, avoiding prohibitive energy consumption and speed overhead in analog to digital converters (ADC). We demonstrate in simulation that our photonic RNN can process multiple WDM channels simultaneously and achieve a reduced bit error rate compared to typical DSP algorithms for all WDM channels in a pulse-amplitude modulation 4-level (PAM4) transmission system, thanks to its unique capability to address inter-channel fiber nonlinearities. In addition to signal quality performance, the proposed system also promises to significantly reduce the power consumption and the latency compared to the state-of-the-art DSP chips, according to our power and latency analysis.

    "abstract": "Polarization is a fundamental degree of freedom for light and is widely leveraged in free space and fiber optics. Non-reciprocal polarization rotation, enabled via the magneto-optic Faraday effect, has been essentially unbeatable for broadband isolators and circulators. For integrated photonics foundries, however, there is still no good path to producing low-loss magneto-optic components, which has prompted a search for alternatives that do not use polarization rotation. Moreover, magneto-optic materials tend to be highly lossy, and while large (10-100 rad/cm) polarization rotation can be achieved, the key figure of merit (rotation-per-loss) is typically < 1 rad/dB. Here, we demonstrate that broadband non-reciprocal polarization rotation can be produced using electro-optics in nanophotonic devices. Our demonstration leverages electro-optic inter-polarization scattering around 780 nm in lithium niobate, in which the reciprocity is broken with the help of a radiofrequency stimulus that carries synthetic momentum. While the demonstrated electro-optic polarization rotation rate is approximately 1 rad/cm, the exceptionally low loss of lithium niobate enables non-reciprocal polarization rotators with figures of merit that are 1-2 orders-of-magnitude better than what is possible with magneto-optics. This approach can be replicated in III-V platforms paving the way for high-performance lasers with co-integrated monolithic isolators. ",

The observed behavior is discussed in terms of polymerization of the glass network, the degree of which rises with concentration of Cu+ ions occupying Td sites in the glass matrix. However, the samples containing low content of CuO are dominated by Cu2+ ions that act as modifiers and induce structural imperfections by breaking of P-O-S bonds. Accordingly, the samples mixed with lower content of CuO are more favorable for inducing higher magnitudes of the optical birefringence. This conclusion is corroborated by results of electrical conductivity, positron annihilation and ultrasonic measurements. ",

    "abstract": "Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) have been widely used in quantum optical technology, but the non-ideal diffraction efficiency limits its application in a quantum system. Here we experimentally demonstrate a bi-frequency interferometer scheme by using AOMs as the beam-splitter and the beam-combiner with a near prefect visibility of $(99.5\\pm0.2)\\%$. Chopped phase locking mode to arbitrary phase offset of the interferometer is achieved by directly introducing phase dithering to the splitting AOM. These features enable the interferometer functions as a high efficiency optical switch for quantum technology. Further discussion shows the interferometer can accomplish the coherent combination of quantum state with different optical frequency and is useful for the generation of entangled quantum state. ",

    "abstract": "A simple scheme is presented for realizing robust optically controlled quantum gates for scalable atomic quantum processors by driving the qubits with optical standing waves. Atoms localized close to the antinodes of the standing wave can realize phase-controlled quantum operations that are potentially more than an order of magnitude less sensitive to the local optical phase and atomic motion than corresponding travelling wave configurations. The scheme is compatible with robust optimal control techniques and spatial qubit addressing in atomic arrays to realize phase controlled operations without the need for tight focusing and precise positioning of the control lasers. This will be particularly beneficial for quantum gates involving Doppler sensitive optical frequency transitions and provides an all optical route to scaling up atomic quantum processors. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed along with Variational Monte Carlo methods for finding the ground state of quantum many-body spin systems with great success. In order to do so, however, a CNN with only linearly many variational parameters has to circumvent the ``curse of dimensionality'' and successfully approximate a wavefunction on an exponentially large Hilbert space. In our work, we provide a theoretical and experimental analysis of how the CNN optimizes learning for spin systems, and investigate the CNN's low dimensional approximation. We first quantify the role played by physical symmetries of the underlying spin system during training. We incorporate our insights into a new training algorithm and demonstrate its improved efficiency, accuracy and robustness. We then further investigate the CNN's ability to approximate wavefunctions by looking at the entanglement spectrum captured by the size of the convolutional filter. Our insights reveal the CNN to be an ansatz fundamentally centered around the occurrence statistics of $K$-motifs of the input strings. We use this motivation to provide the shallow CNN ansatz with a unifying theoretical interpretation in terms of other well-known statistical and physical ansatzes such as the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and entangled plaquette correlator product states (EP-CPS). Using regression analysis, we find further relationships between the CNN's approximations of the different motifs' expectation values. Our results allow us to gain a comprehensive, improved understanding of how CNNs successfully approximate quantum spin Hamiltonians and to use that understanding to improve CNN performance. ",

    "title": "Early stages of polycrystalline diamond deposition: Laser reflectance at  substrates with growing nanodiamonds",
    "abstract": "The chemical vapor deposition of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) films is typically done on substrates seeded with diamond nanoparticles. Specular laser reflectance and a continuous film model have been used to monitor the thickness of these films during their deposition. However, most seeds are isolated during the early stages of the deposition, which questions the utility of applying such a continuous film model for monitoring deposition before film formation. In this work, we present a model based on the Rayleigh theory of scattering for laser reflectance at substrates with growing nanodiamonds to capture the early stages of PCD deposition. The reflectance behavior predicted by our model differs from that of a continuous film, which is well-described by the continuous film model. This difference enlarges as the seed density used in our model decreases. We verify this trend experimentally by depositing diamond under identical conditions on substrates with various seed densities. A relation derived from our model is used to fit reflectance data from which seed densities are obtained that are proportional to those found with electron microscopy. We also show that relying on the continuous film model for describing the early stages of deposition can result in falsely deducing the existence of incubation, and that the continuous film model can be used safely beyond the early stages of deposition. Based on these findings, we delineate a robust method for obtaining growth rates and incubation periods from reflectance measurements. This work may also advance the general understanding of nanoparticle growth and formation. ",

    "abstract": "Nulling interferometry is one of the most promising technologies for imaging exoplanets within stellar habitable zones. The use of photonics for carrying out nulling interferometry enables the contrast and separation required for exoplanet detection. So far, two key issues limiting current-generation photonic nullers have been identified: phase variations and chromaticity within the beam combiner. The use of tricouplers addresses both limitations, delivering a broadband, achromatic null together with phase measurements for fringe tracking. Here, we present a derivation of the transfer matrix of the tricoupler, including its chromatic behaviour, and our 3D design of a fully symmetric tricoupler, built upon a previous design proposed for the GLINT instrument. It enables a broadband null with symmetric, baseline-phase-dependent splitting into a pair of bright channels when inputs are in anti-phase. Within some design trade space, either the science signal or the fringe tracking ability can be prioritised. We also present a tapered-waveguide $180^\\circ$-phase shifter with a phase variation of $0.6^\\circ$ in the $1.4-1.7~\\mu$m band, producing a near-achromatic differential phase between beams{ for optimal operation of the tricoupler nulling stage}. Both devices can be integrated to deliver a deep, broadband null together with a real-time fringe phase metrology signal. ",

Hence, because of quantum complementarity, the cat does not possess any definite value for the property of being dead or alive. It is neither dead nor alive. Namely, the cat paradox is explained through quantum complementarity: of many complementary properties, any quantum system can have a well defined value only of one at a time. While this interpretation only uses textbook concepts (the Copenhagen interpretation), apparently it has never explicitly appeared in the literature. We detail how to build an Arduino based simulation of Schroedinger's experiment for science outreach events. ",
