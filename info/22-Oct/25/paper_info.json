The Bloch surface wave excited on surface of a photonic crystal as electromagnetic hosting photonic mode, and altered the optical response of Rb atoms in the vicinity of surface. Coupling of atomic states with BSW confined modes would lead to quantum interference effects and results in nonlinearities in resonant coupling of atoms with BSW. We show Bloch surface wave induced transparency is highly stable under a change of incidence angle. Our results show slight changes in transitions detunings due to nonlinear interactions like the Casimir-Polder effect under change of localized density of optical states. ",

    "abstract": "We propose to achieve joint detections of frequency and direction of arrival in wideband using single sensor based on an active metasurface with programmable transmission states of pass and stop. By integrating two PIN diodes with the opposite directions into the proposed single-layer and ultrathin meta-atom, the transmission performance with 10 dB difference between the pass and stop states is realized in the bandwidth from 5.9 GHz to 8.8 GHz using field-circuit co-simulations. Accordingly, random receiving patterns are generated by controlling the programmable metasurface composed of the switchable meta-atoms. Afterwards, the frequency and direction information of sources located in the far field are detected using the modified algorithm of estimating signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and the compressive sensing method, respectively. A sample of the programmable metasurface is fabricated and the voltage control system is built up correspondingly. To entirely verify the validity of the proposed method, we conduct three kinds of experiments with one single source, double sources with different frequencies, and double sources with the same frequency, respectively. In all cases, the source information of frequency and direction has been detected preciously in measurements in the frequency band from 6.2 GHz to 8.8 GHz. ",

Special attention is given to panels, which can be designed using several approaches to achieve considerable sound attenuation. Previously, we have presented the concept of thickness-varying periodic plates with optimized profiles to inhibit flexural wave energy propagation. In this work, motivated by biological structures that present multiple locally resonant elements able to cause acoustic cloaking, we extend our shape optimization approach to design panels that achieve improved acoustic insulation performance using either thickness-varying profiles or locally resonant attachments. The optimization is performed using numerical models that combine the Kirchhoff plate theory and the plane wave expansion method. Our results indicate that panels based on locally resonant mechanisms have the advantage of being robust against variation in the incidence angle of acoustic excitation and, therefore, are preferred for single-leaf applications.

    "abstract": "High-speed spatial light modulators (SLM) are crucial components for free-space communication and structured illumination imaging. Current approaches for dynamical spatial mode generation, such as liquid crystal SLMs or digital micromirror devices, are limited to a maximum pattern refresh rate of 10 kHz and have a low damage threshold. We demonstrate that arbitrary spatial profiles in a laser pulse can be generated by mapping the temporal radio-frequency (RF) waveform sent to an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) onto the optical field. We find that the fidelity of the SLM performance can be improved through numerical optimization of the RF waveform to overcome the nonlinear effect of AOM. An AOM can thus be used as a 1-dimensional SLM, a technique we call acousto-optic spatial light modulator (AO-SLM), which has 50 um pixel pitch, over 1 MHz update rate, and high damage threshold. We simulate the application of AO-SLM to single-pixel imaging, which can reconstruct a 32x32 pixel complex object at a rate of 11.6 kHz with 98% fidelity. ",

Miniaturized microfluidic platforms have recently emerged for microscale fluid mixing with their capabilities of high-throughput sample processing and reduced sample depletion. However, microscale fluid mixing is inherently hampered due to the characteristics of a low Reynolds number flows in diminutive channels. Microscale fluid mixing mainly depends on molecular diffusion and thus requires long processing time. In order to address the conundrum, a variety of active microfluidic approaches for swift and efficient mixing have been developed using electro-kinetic flow, laser-induced flow, magnetic stirring, and acoustic streaming flow (ASF). Among these techniques with external force fields, acoustofluidic fluid mixing has been acclaimed due to its on-demand, controllable, non-invasive and biocompatible nature. In this study, we performed numerical simulations of acoustic streaming flows, induced by with a highly localized surface acoustic waves (SAWs), in a microscale fluidic channel based on an acoustic wave attenuation model ",

However, these structures typically suffer from post-yield softenings originating from the limited plasticity of available material choices. This study aims to resolve such an issue by fabricating lattice structures made of ductile pure copper (Cu). For the first time, Cu lattice structures are fabricated through laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) with green laser ({\\lambda} = 515 nm). Structural and microstructural analysis confirm that the lattice structures consist of well-defined unit cells and show dense microstructure. The deformation behavior is investigated under a wide range of strain rates from ~0.001 /s to ~1000 /s. The stress-strain curves exhibit a smooth and continuous deformation without any post-yield softening, which can be attributed to the intrinsic mechanical properties of Cu. Correlated with post-mortem microscopy examination, the rate-dependent deformation behavior of pure Cu lattice structures is investigated and rationalized. The current work suggests that the complex Cu architectures can be fabricated by L-PBF with green laser and the lattice structures made of ductile metal are suitable for dynamic loading applications.

These bunches, possessing a charge ranging from tens to hundreds of pC and a size from tens of microns to millimeters, are suitably provided by the FERMI electron linac in Trieste, Italy. The high density of charge carriers generated by ionization in the diamond bulk causes a transient modification of electrical properties of DS (e.g., resistance), which in turn affects the signal shape. We have modeled a two-step numerical approach, simulating the effects on the signal of both the evolution of charge carrier density in the diamond bulk and the changes in the circuit parameters. This approach interprets features observed in our experimental results to a great extent. ",

Moreover, contemporary cavities frequently include 2D materials to exploit and resonantly enhance their nonlinear properties or provide tunability. Such materials add further modeling complexity due to their infinitesimally thin nature and strong dispersion. Here, a formalism for efficiently analyzing third harmonic generation (THG) in nanoparticles and metasurfaces incorporating 2D materials is proposed. It is based on numerically calculating the quasinormal modes in the nanostructure, it is general, and does not make any prior assumptions regarding the number of resonances involved in the conversion process, in contrast to conventional coupled-mode theory approaches in the literature. The capabilities of the framework are showcased via two selected examples: a single scatterer and a periodic metasurface incorporating graphene for its high third-order nonlinearity. In both cases, excellent agreement with full-wave nonlinear simulations is obtained. The proposed framework may constitute an invaluable tool for gaining physical insight into the frequency generation process in nano-optic structures and providing guidelines for achieving drastically enhanced THG efficiency.

The single mode tapered optical fiber has been used in various sensing applications in recent times.

The optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) detects the changes in the free spectral range (FSR), period, and transmission power loss from the ion beam irradiated TOFs. The change in the refractive index of the cladding material due to the implanted ions influences the transmission spectra of the TOFs and we could able to detect ions of energy as low as 80 keV. COMSOL simulation results are employed to explain the observed changes in spectra. The ion beams induced surface modification and defect formation as well as the implantation in TOF have been predicted using Monte Carlo based 3D TRI3DYN ion-solid interaction simulation and corroborated with other experimental studies such as scanning electron microscopy and Raman scattering spectroscopy. Such tapered optical fiber-based detection technique will help to develop portable device to detect charged particles in space exploration and in nuclear reactors. ",

Here, we unravel coherent superposition of excited Mie-scattering moments in a dipolar antenna, coupled with a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center, to achieve bright single photon source with GHz collection rate. Such balancing of Mie-scattering moments, especially higher-order multi-polar moments, provide strong forward light scattering with null backward scattering at the generalized Kerker condition. This results in strong field intensity localization that can be used to shape the emission from an embedded NV- center in the dipolar antenna. A relative decay rate enhancement of more than 300 times with collection efficiency exceeding 75% is achieved that result in photon collection rate of ~ 5 GHz.

Here we report the coherent control of a microwave cavity mode using laser light in a multimode device at millikelvin temperature with near unity cooperativity, as manifested by the observation of electro-optically induced transparency and absorption due to the electro-optical dynamical back-action. We show that both the stationary and instantaneous pulsed response of the microwave and optical modes comply with the coherent electro-optical interaction and reveal only minuscule amount of excess back-action with an unanticipated time delay. Our demonstration represents a key step to attain full quantum control of microwave circuits using laser light, with possible applications ranging from optical quantum non-demolition measurements of microwave fields beyond the standard quantum limit, optical microwave ground state cooling and squeezing, to quantum transduction, entanglement generation and hybrid quantum networks.

The system is described by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with site-dependent hopping parameters. We study numerically and analytically the interface states. The ground state is described by the Jackiw-Rebbi mode with a pure imaginary energy, reflecting the non-Hermiticity of the system. It is strictly localized only at the A sites. We also find a series of analytic solutions of excited states based on SUSY quantum mechanics, where the A and B sites of the bipartite lattice form SUSY partners. We then study the system containing loss and gain with saturation. The Jackiw-Rebbi mode is extended to a nonlinear theory, where B sites are also excited. The relative phases between A and B sites are fixed, and hence it will serve as a large area coherent laser. ",

    "abstract": "A quantum thermal machine is an open quantum system coupled to hot and cold thermal baths. Thus, its dynamics can be well understood using the concepts and tools from non-Hermitian quantum systems. A hallmark of non-Hermiticity is the existence of exceptional points where the eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian or an Liouvillian superoperator and their associated eigenvectors coalesce. Here, we report the experimental realisation of a single-ion heat engine and demonstrate the effect of the Liouvillian exceptional points on the dynamics and the performance of a quantum heat engine. Our experiments have revealed that operating the engine in the exact- and broken-phases, separated by a Liouvillian exceptional point, respectively during the isochoric heating and cooling strokes of an Otto cycle produces more work and output power and achieves higher efficiency than executing the Otto cycle completely in the exact phase where the system has an oscillatory dynamics and higher coherence. This result opens interesting possibilities for the control of quantum heat engines and will be of interest to other research areas that are concerned with the role of coherence and exceptional points in quantum processes and in work extraction by thermal machines.

    "abstract": "Correlation functions of quantum systems are central objects in quantum field theories which may be defined in high-dimensional space-time domains. The numerical treatment of these objects suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which hinders the application of sophisticated many-body theories to interesting problems. Here, we propose a quantum-inspired Multi-Scale Space-Time Ansatz (MSSTA) for correlation functions of quantum systems. The space-time dependence is mapped to auxiliary qubit degrees of freedom describing exponentially different length scales, and the ansatz assumes a separation of length scales. We numerically verify the ansatz for various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems and demonstrate compression rates of several orders of magnitude for challenging cases. Essential building blocks of diagrammatic equations, such as convolutions or Fourier transforms are formulated in the compressed form. We numerically demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed methods for the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. MSSTA provides a unified framework for implementing efficient computations of quantum field theories. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents experimental and modelling results of an ultra-compact self-rectifier flux pump energizing a superconducting coil. The device fits inside a volume of 65x65x50~mm and generates up to 320~A dc through the coil and a peak output voltage up to 60~mV. We also develop and present a full electromagnetic effective circuit model of the flux pump and compare its predictions to the experimental results. We show that our model can reproduce accurately the charging of the load coil and that it reproduces the systematic dependence of the maximum load coil current on the input current waveform. The experiments and modelling together show also the importance of dc-flux offsets in the transformer core on the final achievable current through the coil. The miniaturization possible for this class of flux pump and their minimal heat-leak into the cryogenic environment from thermal conduction make them attractive for applications with demanding size, weight and power limitations. Our effective circuit model is a useful tool in the understanding, design and optimization of such flux pumps which will accelerate their progression from research devices to their application. ",

    "abstract": "LUXE (Laser Und XFEL Experiment) is a proposed experiment at DESY which will study Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the strong-field regime, where QED becomes non-perturbative. Measuring the rate of created electron-positron pairs using a silicon pixel tracking detector is an essential ingredient to study this regime. Precision tracking of positrons traversing the four layers of the tracking detector becomes very challenging at high laser intensities due to the high rates, which can be computationally expensive for classical computers. In this work, we update our previous study of the potential of using quantum computing to reconstruct positron tracks. The reconstruction task is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation and is solved using simulated quantum computers and a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, namely the variational quantum eigensolver. Different ansatz circuits and optimisers are studied. The results are discussed and compared with classical track reconstruction algorithms using a graph neural network and a combinatorial Kalman filter. ",
