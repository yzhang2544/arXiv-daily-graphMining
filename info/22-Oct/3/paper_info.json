    "abstract": "Thin crystalline silicon solar photovoltaics holds great potential for reducing the module price by material saving and increasing the efficiency by reduced bulk recombination loss. However, the module efficiency decreases rather sensitively as the module temperature rises under sunlight. Effective, inexpensive approach to cooling modules would accelerate large-scale market adoption of thin crystalline silicon photovoltaics. For effective cooling, we exploit high flexibility of single-crystalline thin silicon films to create wavy solar cells. These wavy cells possess larger surface area than conventional flat cells, while occupying the same projected area. We experimentally demonstrate that the temperature of thin wavy crystalline silicon solar cells under the sunlight can be significantly reduced by increased convective cooling due to their large surface area. The substantial efficiency gain, achieved by the effective heat removal, points to high-performance thin crystalline silicon photovoltaic systems that are radically different in configuration from conventional systems.

    "abstract": "Post-compression methods for ultrafast laser pulses typically face challenging limitations including saturation effects and temporal pulse break-up when large compression factors and broad bandwidths are targeted. To overcome these limitations, we exploit direct dispersion control in a gas-filled multi-pass cell, enabling for the first time single-stage post-compression of 150 fs pulses and up to 250 uJ pulse energy from an Ytterbium (Yb) fiber laser down to sub-20 fs. Dispersion-engineered dielectric cavity mirrors are used to achieve nonlinear spectral broadening dominated by self-phase-modulation over large compression factors and bandwidths at 98% throughput. Our method opens a route towards single-stage post-compression of Yb lasers into the few-cycle regime. ",

    "abstract": "We present and theoretically investigate a dispersion engineered GaP-OI microresonator containing a partially-etched gap of 250 nm x 410 nm in a 600 nm x 2990 nm waveguide. This gap enables a 3.25 {\\mu}m wide anomalous dispersion spectral span covering both the near-infrared and the mid-infrared spectra. This anomalous dispersion is manifested by two mechanisms, being the hybridization of the fundamental TE modes around 1550 nm and the geometric dispersion of the higher order TE mode around the 3100 nm wavelengths, respectively. Two Kerr soliton combs can be numerically generated with 101 GHz and 97 GHz teeth spacings at these spectral windows. The proposed structure demonstrates the design flexibility thanks to the partially etched gap and paves the way towards potential coherent multicolor frequency comb generation in the emerging GaP-OI platform.

In this paper, we propose equivariant energy-guided stochastic differential equations (EEGSDE), a flexible framework for controllable 3D molecule generation under the guidance of an energy function in diffusion models. Formally, we show that EEGSDE naturally exploits the geometric symmetry in 3D molecular conformation, as long as the energy function is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Empirically, under the guidance of designed energy functions, EEGSDE significantly improves the baseline on QM9, in inverse molecular design targeted to quantum properties and molecular structures. Furthermore, EEGSDE is able to generate molecules with multiple target properties by combining the corresponding energy functions linearly. ",

The racetrack memory made of synthetic ferrimagnetic material with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is coupled on to a photonic waveguide onto the indium phosphide membrane on silicon platform. The device which is composed of a double V-shaped gold plasmonic nanoantenna coupled with a photonic crystal cavity can enable switching and reading of the magnetization state in nanoscale magnetic bits by enhancing the absorbed energy density and polar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE) locally beyond the diffraction limit. Using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, we numerically show that our device can switch and read the magnetization state in targeted bits down to ~100 nm in the presence of oppositely magnetized background regions in the racetrack with widths of 30 to 120 nm, clearly outperforming a bare photonic waveguide. Our hybrid device tackles the challenges of nonlinear absorption in the waveguide, weak PMOKE, and size mismatch between spintronics and integrated photonics. Thus, it provides missing link between the integrated photonics and nanoscale spintronics, expediting the development of ultrafast and energy efficient advanced on-chip applications. ",

    "abstract": "Increasing the information capacity of communication channels is a pressing need, driven by growing data demands and the consequent impending data crunch with existing modulation schemes. In this regard, mode division multiplexing (MDM), where the spatial modes of light form the encoding basis, has enormous potential and appeal, but is impeded by modal noise due to imperfect channels. Here we overcome this challenge by breaking the existing MDM paradigm of using the modes themselves as a discrete basis, instead exploiting the polarization inhomogeneity (vectorness) of vectorial light as our information carrier. We show that this encoding basis can be partitioned and detected almost at will, and measured in a channel independent fashion, a fact we confirm experimentally using atmospheric turbulence as a highly perturbing channel example. Our approach replaces conventional amplitude modulation with a novel modal alternative for potentially orders of magnitude channel information enhancement, yet is robust to fading even through noisy channels, offering a new paradigm to exploiting the spatial mode basis for optical communication.

Here, we overcome the low conversion efficiency by two-color wave mixing. A quantum theory reveals that our experiments follow a novel generation mechanism where the conventional interband and intraband nonlinear dynamics are boosted by Floquet-Bloch dressed states, that make solid HHG in the XUV more efficient by at least one order of magnitude. Emission intensity scalings that follow perturbative optical wave mixing, combined with the angular separation of the emitted frequencies, make our approach a decisive step for all-solid coherent XUV sources and for studying light-engineered materials.

This compact interferometer, potentially set in a portable device for field operations, could allow the detection of low concentrations of methane at up to 100m range.

Much previous research was focused on large continental areas, while small systems, such as islands are less well-studied. These natural island systems are ideal testing environments for microgrid proposals and artificially islanded grid operation. In the present paper, we utilize measurements of the power grid frequency obtained in European islands: the Faroe Islands, Ireland, the Balearic Islands and Iceland and investigate how their frequency can be predicted, compared to the Nordic power system, acting as a reference. The Balearic islands are found to be particularly deterministic and easy to predict in contrast to hard-to-predict Iceland. Furthermore, we show that typically 2-4 weeks of data are needed to improve prediction performance beyond simple benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, hybrid design strategies combining machine learning (ML) with electromagnetic optimization algorithms have emerged as a new paradigm for the inverse design of photonic structures and devices. While a trained, data-driven neural network can rapidly identify solutions near the global optimum with a given dataset's design space, an iterative optimization algorithm can further refine the solution and overcome dataset limitations. Furthermore, such hybrid ML-optimization methodologies can reduce computational costs and expedite the discovery of novel electromagnetic components. However, existing hybrid ML-optimization methods have yet to optimize across both materials and geometries in a single integrated and user-friendly environment. In addition, due to the challenge of acquiring large datasets for ML, as well as the exponential growth of isolated models being trained for photonics design, there is a need to standardize the ML-optimization workflow while making the pre-trained models easily accessible. Motivated by these challenges, here we introduce DeepAdjoint, a general-purpose, open-source, and multi-objective \"all-in-one\" global photonics inverse design application framework which integrates pre-trained deep generative networks with state-of-the-art electromagnetic optimization algorithms such as the adjoint variables method. DeepAdjoint allows a designer to specify an arbitrary optical design target, then obtain a photonic structure that is robust to fabrication tolerances and possesses the desired optical properties - all within a single user-guided application interface. Our framework thus paves a path towards the systematic unification of ML and optimization algorithms for photonic inverse design. ",

Interatomic interactions are modeled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian fitted to density-functional calculations. Quantum atomic delocalization combined with anharmonicity of the vibrational modes cause changes in structural and thermal properties of 2D SiC, which we quantify by comparison of PIMD results with those derived from classical molecular dynamics simulations, as well as with those given by a quantum harmonic approximation. Nuclear quantum effects are found to be appreciable in structural properties such as the layer area and interatomic distances. Moreover, we consider a {\\em real} area for the SiC sheet, which takes into account bending and rippling at finite temperatures. Differences between this area and the in-plane area are discussed in the context of quantum atomic dynamics. The bending constant ($\\kappa = 1.0$ eV) and the 2D modulus of hydrostatic compression ($B_{xy}$ = 5.5 eV/\\AA$^2$) are clearly lower than the corresponding values for graphene.
