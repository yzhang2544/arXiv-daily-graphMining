    "abstract": "The lack of a bulk second-order nonlinearity (\\c{hi}(2)) in silicon nitride (Si3N4) keeps this low-loss, CMOS-compatible platform from key active functions such as Pockels electro-optic (EO) modulation and efficient second harmonic generation (SHG). We demonstrate a successful induction of \\c{hi}(2) in Si3N4 through electrical poling with an externally-applied field to align the Si-N bonds. This alignment breaks the centrosymmetry of Si3N4, and enables the bulk \\c{hi}(2). The sample is heated to over 500{\\deg}C to facilitate the poling. The comparison between the EO responses of poled and non-poled Si3N4, measured using a Si3N4 micro-ring modulator, shows at least a 25X enhancement in the r33 EO component. The maximum \\c{hi}(2) we obtain through poling is 0.24pm/V. We observe a remarkable improvement in the speed of the measured EO responses from 3GHz to 15GHz (3dB bandwidth) after the poling, which confirms the \\c{hi}(2) nature of the EO response induced by poling. This work paves the way for high-speed active functions on the Si3N4 platform. ",

    "abstract": "Neutrino experiments often use large volumes of water, organic scintillators or noble liquids as active detection material. Due to the large hydrostatic and buoyancy forces involved, precise knowledge of the liquid levels inside the detector tank are mandatory. Here we present the main characteristics of the TruSense S310 Laser Range System that offers several advantages over other level-measurement methods for this special environment. Level measurements can be performed without direct contact to the liquid and through a gas-proof acrylic window, thus preserving the strict radiopurity and chemical requirements of the target liquid. We report the results of a suit of laboratory experiments for short-term precision ($\\pm$4 mm) and long-term stability (< 9 mm) of the level measurement. Moreover, we demonstrate that the infrared laser can be used while standard bi-alkali PMTs are operational. We discuss the mechanical layout and integration of the system in the OSIRIS pre-detector that will monitor the radiopurity of the liquid scintillator for the large-volume neutrino experiment JUNO.

    "abstract": "Topological photonic edge states are conventionally formed at the interface between two domains of topologically trivial and nontrivial photonic crystals. Recent works exploiting photonic quantum Hall and quantum valley Hall effects have shown that large-area topological waveguide states could be created in a three-layer topological heterostructure that consists of a finite-width domain featuring Dirac cone sandwiched between two domains of photonic crystals with opposite topological properties. In this work, we show that a new kind of large-area topological waveguide states could be created employing the photonic analogs of quantum spin Hall effect. Taking the well-used Wu-Hu model in topological photonics as an example, we show that sandwiching a finite-width domain of photonic crystal featuring double Dirac cone between two domains of expanded and shrunken unit cells could lead to the emergence of large-area helical waveguide states distributed uniformly in the middle domain. Importantly, we unveil a power-law scaling regarding to the size of the bandgap within which the large-area helical states reside as a function of the width of the middle domain, which implies that these large-area modes in principle could exist in the middle domain with arbitrary width. Moreover, pseudospin-momentum locking unidirectional propagations and robustness of these large-area waveguide modes against sharp bends are explicitly demonstrated. Our work enlarges the photonic systems and platforms that could be utilized for large-area-mode enabled topological waveguiding. ",

    "abstract": "The implementation of terahertz (THz) wafer-level metadevices is critical to advance the science for applications including (I) integrated focal plane array which can image for biology and (II) integrated narrowband absorbers for high spectral resolution THz spectroscopy. Substantial progress has been made in the development of THz metamaterials; however, a wafer-level low-stress THz metadevices platform remains a challenge. This paper experimentally demonstrates a substrate-free THz metadevices platform adopting engineered Si-rich and low-stress silicon nitride (SiNx) thin films, achieving an extensive THz transparency up to f = 2.5 THz. A new analytical model is first reported from the Lorentz model that can accurately predict spectral responses of metal insulator metal (MIM) metamaterial absorbers. The model is experimentally validated in the THz range and exploited for the first demonstration of a THz absorber, which exhibits performance approaching the predicted results. Our results show that the wafer-level SiNx platform will accelerate the development of large-scale, sophisticated substrate-free THz metadevices. The Lorentz model and its quadratic model will be a very practical method for designing THz metadevices. ",

    "abstract": "Broadband Kerr combs with a flat comb spectral profile are expected in a number of applications, such as high-capacity optical communication. Here, we propose novel concentric dual-ring microresonators (DRMs) for advanced dispersion engineering to tailor the comb spectral profile. The dispersion can be flexibly engineered not only by the cross-section of the DRMs, but also by the gap between concentric dual-ring microresonators, which provides a new path to geometrically control the spectral profile of the soliton Kerr combs. An octave-spanning dissipative Kerr soliton comb with superior spectral flatness has been achieved numerically, covering from the telecommunication band to the mid-infrared (MIR) band region with a -40 dB bandwidth of 1265 nm (99.82 THz). Our results are promising to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics in hybrid modes in DRMs, which helps control broadband comb formation. ",

Based on an extension of the Lugiato-Lefever equation we investigate in this paper the perspectives of changing the pump scheme from the well-understood monochromatic pump to a dual-tone configuration simultaneously pumping two modes. For the case of anomalous dispersion we give a detailed study of the optimal choices of detuning offsets and division of total pump power between the two modes in order to optimize single-soliton comb states with respect to performance metrics like power conversion efficiency and bandwidth. Our approach allows also to quantify the performance metrics of the optimal single-soliton comb states and determine their trends over a wide range of technically relevant parameters. ",

We investigate temporally dispersive dual-comb generation of phase-matched combs with broad bandwidth, and report conditions for accessing a multistable regime that simultaneously supports two types of coupled bright cavity solitons. These bistable cavity solitons coexist for the same pump power and frequency detuning, while featuring dissimilar amplitudes of their individual field components. Third-harmonic generation frequency combs can permit telecom pump laser sources to simultaneously directly access both the near-infrared and the visible regions, which may be advantageous for the development of optical clocks and sensing applications.

    "abstract": "A new generation of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), produced in a 65 nm CMOS imaging process, promises higher densities of on-chip circuits and, for a given pixel size, more sophisticated in-pixel logic compared to larger feature size processes. MAPS are a cost-effective alternative to hybrid pixel sensors since flip-chip bonding is not required. In addition, they allow for significant reductions of the material budget of detector systems, due to the smaller physical thicknesses of the active sensor and the absence of a separate readout chip. The TANGERINE project develops a sensor suitable for future Higgs factories as well as for a beam telescope to be used at beam-test facilities. The sensors will have small collection electrodes (order of $\\mu$m) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, which makes it possible to minimize power dissipation in the circuitry. The first batch of test chips, featuring full front-end amplifiers with Krummenacher feedback, was produced and tested at the Mainzer Mikrotron (MAMI) at the end of 2021. MAMI provides an electron beam with currents up to 100 $\\mu$A and an energy of 855 MeV. The analog output signal of the test chips was recorded with a high bandwidth oscilloscope and used to study the charge-sensitive amplifier of the chips in terms of waveform analysis. A beam telescope was used as a reference system to allow for track-based analysis of the recorded data. ",

Here, we demonstrate stroboscopic, two-photon imaging of soliton molecules (SM) with completely unsynchronized lasers, where the wavelength and bandwidth constraints are considerably eased compared to conventional imaging techniques. Two-photon detection enables the probe and tested oscillator to operate at completely different wavelengths, which permits mature near-infrared laser technology to be leveraged for rapid SM studies of emerging long-wavelength laser sources. As a demonstration, using a 1550 nm probe laser we image the behavior of soliton singlets across the 1800-2100 nm range, and capture the rich dynamics of evolving multiatomic SM. This technique may prove to be an essential, easy-to-implement diagnostic tool for detecting the presence of loosely-bound SM, which often remain unnoticed due to instrumental resolution or bandwidth limitations.

To characterize the system, the Hall drift of the employed atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in the lowest Landau level is determined. The topological properties are verified by determining the local Chern marker, and upon performing system excitations both cyclotron and skipping orbits are observed in the bulk and edge respectively.
