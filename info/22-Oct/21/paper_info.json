The experimental data obtained are satisfactorily explained by the developed theory.Finally, we discuss the experimental results obtained and possible applications of the derived pulse area approach.

    "abstract": "Controlling the coherence between light and matter has enabled the radiation of electromagnetic waves with spectral purity and stability that defines the Syst\\`eme International (SI) second. While transitions between hyperfine levels in atoms are accessible in the microwave and optical domains, faithfully transferring such stability to other frequency ranges of interest is not trivial. Such stability is specifically sought after for the terahertz domain to improve the resolution in very long baseline interferometry and molecular spectroscopy, and advance the technological development of high-speed, high data rate wireless communications. However, there is an evident lack of native frequency references in this spectral range, essential for the consistency of measurements and traceability. To mitigate the frequency drift encompassed in such waves, we experimentally demonstrate that using rotational spectroscopy of nitrous oxide N2O can lead to linewidth reduction up to a thousandfold. A pair of diode lasers, optically injected with a low-noise, chip-based dissipative Kerr soliton, were incident upon a uni-travelling-carrier photodiode. We frequency-locked the emitted terahertz wave to the center of a rotational transition of N2O through phase modulation spectroscopy. A terahertz wave with a 6 Hz linewidth was achieved (fractional frequency stability of $2 \\times 10^{-11}$ at 1 second averaging time) while circumventing the need of frequency multiplication or division of frequency standards.

Photodissociation dynamics is examined via direct numerical integration of the coupled Maxwell-Schrodinger equations with molecular ro-vibrational degrees of freedom explicitly taken into account.

    "abstract": "Temporally stabilized optical pules, confined in microresonators driven by a continuous-wave laser, have attracted tremendous attention due to their fascinating features with many applications. Here we report the observations of mode-locked platicon frequency microcomb formation in normal dispersion dispersion-managed microresonators operating at microwave K-band repetition rate for the first time. Facilitated by the thermally controllable modulated background induced by avoided mode-crossings, various platicon bound state patterns with regular and irregular temporal separation are stably generated due to an additional balance between repulsive and attractive forces resulting from non-trivial interpulse and background electromagnetic field interactions. The number of mode-locked pulses can be switched by forward- and backward-cavity pump detuning and, with increasing pump power, result in stationary bound-state complexes. These experimental observations are in accordance with our nonlinear numerical simulations that includes avoided mode-crossing, anomalous fourth-order dispersion and quality-factor spectral filtering. The observed platicon mode-locked pulses have broad spectral profiles overlapping Kelly-sideband-like parametric oscillation. The single-sideband phase noise of microcomb repetition rate is characterized for the different mode-locked states, comparable with electronic microwave oscillators. The ability to achieve mode-locking in dispersion-managed microresonators provides a platform to reduce pulse timing jitter and enrich the exploration of ultrafast phenomena in microresonators. ",

We also present the effect of two-stream type instability in the ion acoustic feature showing the opposite trend to the overlapped case resulting from the asymmetry in electron distribution function caused by the instability. Our results show that the two-stream plasmas have significant effects on CTS spectra and the waves resulting from instability can be observed in the ion acoustic feature. ",

It is believed that internal gravity waves (IGW) are the main wave process in the atmosphere. However, the explanation of the process of IGW occurrence cannot be considered sufficiently substantiated, because the reasons for the appearance of the selected air parcel, which is affected by the initial disturbance, are not yet clear. The data of the performed experiments on the detection of wave processes shows the presence of noticeable oscillatory movements not only during the passage of fronts or other disturbances, but also in good weather. As an alternative to IGW, I consider a possible process of generating volumetric acoustic oscillations due to the formation of an acoustic resonator in the atmosphere. The probability of formation of such oscillations is high, because they do not require the presence of sharp changes in the parameters of the atmosphere to appear. ",

We theoretically calculate and numerically simulate the CTS spectra in two-stream plasmas as a typical example of non-equilibrium system in space and astrophysical plasmas.

We first develop models to identify features observed in laser self-heterodyne noise spectra, focusing on the effects of white noise and servo bumps. In the weak-noise regime, characteristic of well-stabilized lasers, we show that an analytical theory based on a perturbative solution of a master equation agrees very well with numerical simulations that incorporate phase noise. We compute quantum gate fidelities for one- and two-photon Rabi oscillations and show that they can be enhanced by an appropriate choice of Rabi frequency relative to spectral noise peaks. We also analyze the influence of intensity noise with spectral support smaller than the Rabi frequency. Our results establish requirements on laser noise levels needed to achieve desired gate fidelities. ",

    "abstract": "Single photon emitters in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising solid-state quantum emitters for photonic applications and quantum networks. Despite their favorable properties, it has so far remained elusive to determine the origin of these emitters. We focus on two different kinds of hBN samples that particularly lend themselves for integration with nanophotonic devices, multilayer nanoflakes produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and a layer engineered sample from hBN grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). We investigate their inherent defects and fit their emission properties to computationally simulated optical properties of likely carbon-related defects. Thereby we are able to narrow down the origin of emitters found in these samples and find that the C2CB defect fits our spectral data best. In addition, we demonstrate a scalable way of coupling LPE hBN to optical nanofibers that are directly connected to optical fibers. Our work brings us one step closer to specifying the origin of hBN's promising quantum emitters and sheds more light onto the characteristics of emitters in samples that are particularly suited for integration with nanophotonics. This knowledge will prove invaluable for novel nanophotonic platforms and may contribute towards the employment of hBN for future quantum technologies. ",

Such detailed and accurate forecast is typically performed with numerical atmospheric models. Recently short-term forecasts (a few hours in advance) are also being provided (ALTA project) using a technique based on an autoregression approach, as part of a strategy that aims to increase the forecast accuracy. It has been proved that such a technique is able to achieve unprecedented performances so far. Such short-term predictions make use of the numerical model forecast and real-time observations. In recent years machine learning (ML) techniques also started to be used to provide an atmospheric and turbulence forecast. Preliminary results indicate however an accuracy not really competitive with respect to the autoregressive method or even prediction by persistence. This technique might be applicable joint to atmospheric model. It is therefore interesting to investigate the main features of their performances and characteristics (also because there is a great number of algorithms potentially accessible) to understand if results achieved so far can be further improved using ML. In this study we focus on a purely machine learning application to short term forecast (1-2 hours) of astroclimatic and other atmospheric parameters above VLT. ",

Generative neural networks are trained on spin configurations produced by a D-Wave quantum annealer. They are then used to generate smart proposals for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In particular, we explore hybrid schemes by combining single spin-flip and neural proposals, as well as D-Wave and classical Monte Carlo training data. The hybrid algorithm outperforms the single spin-flip Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is competitive with parallel tempering in terms of correlation times, with the significant benefit of a much faster equilibration. ",
