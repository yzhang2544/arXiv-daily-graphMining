    "title": "Topological aspects in nonlinear optical frequency conversion",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, observed more than half a century ago, is a corner stone in modern applications of nonlinear and quantum optics. It is well known that frequency conversion processes are constrained by conservation laws, such as momentum conservation that requires phase matching conditions for efficient conversion. However, conservation laws alone could not fully capture the features of nonlinear frequency conversion. Here it is shown that topology can provide additional constraints in nonlinear multi-frequency conversion processes. Unlike conservation laws, a topological constraint concerns with the conserved properties under continuous deformation, and can be regarded as a new indispensable degree of freedom to describe multi-frequency processes. We illustrate such a paradigm by considering sum frequency generation under a multi-frequency pump wave, showing that, akin topological phases in topological insulators, topological phase transitions can be observed in the frequency conversion process both at classical and quantum level.

    "title": "Quantum Biochemical Analysis of the TtgR Regulator and Effectors",
    "abstract": "The recent expansion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens poses significant challenges in treating healthcare-associated infections. Although antibacterial resistance occurs by numerous mechanisms, active efflux of the drugs is a critical concern. A single species of efflux pump can produce a simultaneous resistance to several drugs. One of the best-studied efflux pumps is the TtgABC: a tripartite resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump implicated in the intrinsic antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E. The expression of the TtgABC gene is down-regulated by the HTH-type transcriptional repressor TtgR. In this context, by employing quantum chemistry methods based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the Molecular Fragmentation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC) approach, we investigate the coupling profiles of the transcriptional regulator TtgR in complex with quercetin (QUE), a natural polyphenolic flavonoid, tetracycline (TAC), and chloramphenicol (CLM), two broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Our quantum biochemical computational results show the: [i] convergence radius, [ii] total binding energy, [iii] relevance (energetically) of the ligands regions, and [iv] most relevant amino acids residues of the TtgR-QUE/TAC/CLM complexes, pointing out distinctions and similarities among them. These findings improve the understanding of the binding mechanism of effectors and facilitate the development of new chemicals targeting TtgR, helping in the battle against the rise of resistance to antimicrobial drugs.

A unique feature is bridging the spin-polarization in a static frame and the spin-precession in a rotating frame. The new method accommodates temporally and spatially localized multiplexing measurements and can be ubiquitously applied to generic ion species.

    "abstract": "The planar Goubau line is a promising low-loss metal waveguide for terahertz interconnects. To enable advanced system architectures and multi-port measurements based on planar Goubau lines, there is a strong need for broadband impedance-matched loads, which can be used to absorb the energy and minimize standing waves in a system. In this work, we propose a matched load for planar Goubau lines based on an exponentially-tapered corrugated line, gradually increasing conductor losses while maintaining small reflections. The corrugation density is high enough to increase conductor losses without requiring an auxiliary low-conductivity material, simplifying the fabrication process. A 400-$\\mu$m long planar Goubau line load was fabricated on a 10-$\\mu$m thick silicon substrate suspended in the air. Electromagnetic simulations of the load show excellent agreement with calibrated reflection measurements in the frequency range 0.5 THz - 1.1 THz. Above the cut-off frequency of around 580 GHz, the measured reflections are much less than -19 dB, below the noise floor of the characterization setup. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Task-based assessment of image quality in undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a way of evaluating the impact of regularization on task performance. In this work, we evaluated the effect of total variation (TV) and wavelet regularization on human detection of signals with a varying background and validated a model observer in predicting human performance. Approach: For the human observer studies we used two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) studies with a small signal known exactly (SKE) task but with varying backgrounds for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images reconstructed from undersampled multi-coil data. We used a 3.48 undersampling factor with TV and a wavelet sparsity constraints. The sparse difference-of-Gaussians (S-DOG) observer with internal noise was used to model human observer detection. That S-DOG model was used to predict the percent correct of human observers for a range of regularization parameters. Results: We found that the human observer detection performance remained fairly constant for a broad range of values in the regularization parameter before decreasing at large values. Using the TV, wavelet sparsity, or a combination of the constraints did not meaningfully improve task performance. The model observer tracked the performance of the human observers as the regularization was increased but over-estimated the PC for large amounts of regularization for TV and wavelet sparsity, as well as the combination of both parameters. Conclusions: For the task we studied, the S-DOG observer was able to reasonably predict human performance with both total variation and wavelet sparsity regularizers over a broad range of regularization parameters. We also did not find a large improvement in task performance due to regularization. ",

Specifically, we demonstrate that the optical response of an important class of such nanoscale structures is reproduced accurately by a simple, one-dimensional model, within the entire spectral range of interest. This model can describe a variety of tapered photonic crystal structures. Orders of magnitude faster to solve, our approach can be used to optimize certain properties of the nanoscale cavity. Here we consider the case of a nanobeam cavity, where the confinement results from the modulation of its width. The profile of the width is optimized, in order to flatten the resonator dispersion profile (so that all modes are equally spaced in frequency). This result is particularly relevant for miniaturizing parametric generators of non-classical light, optical nano-combs and mode-locked laser sources. Our method can be easily extended to complex geometries, described by multiple parameters. ",

However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation well. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, that includes the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. The outcome is compared with the experimental observation and the predictions by Majorana, Rabi, and an alternative model called co-quantum dynamics. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model, which does not use free parameters, are still below zero. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored in the appendices for discussion. ",

    "title": "Quantum Algorithms for Geologic Fracture Networks",
    "abstract": "Solving large systems of equations is a challenge for modeling natural phenomena, such as simulating subsurface flow. To avoid systems that are intractable on current computers, it is often necessary to neglect information at small scales, an approach known as coarse-graining. For many practical applications, such as flow in porous, homogenous materials, coarse-graining offers a sufficiently-accurate approximation of the solution. Unfortunately, fractured systems cannot be accurately coarse-grained, as critical network topology exists at the smallest scales, including topology that can push the network across a percolation threshold. Therefore, new techniques are necessary to accurately model important fracture systems. Quantum algorithms for solving linear systems offer a theoretically-exponential improvement over their classical counterparts, and in this work we introduce two quantum algorithms for fractured flow. The first algorithm, designed for future quantum computers which operate without error, has enormous potential, but we demonstrate that current hardware is too noisy for adequate performance. The second algorithm, designed to be noise resilient, already performs well for problems of small to medium size (order 10 to 1000 nodes), which we demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically. We expect further improvements by leveraging quantum error mitigation and preconditioning. ",

    "abstract": "Optical measurements under externally applied stresses allow us to study the materials' electronic structure by comparing the pressure evolution of optical peaks obtained from experiments and theoretical calculations. We examine the stress-induced changes in electronic structure for the thermodynamically stable 1T polytype of selected MX2 compounds (M=Hf, Zr, Sn; X=S, Se), using the density functional theory. We demonstrate that considered 1T-MX2 materials are semiconducting with indirect character of the band gap, irrespective to the employed pressure as predicted using modified Becke-Johnson potential. We determine energies of direct interband transitions between bands extrema and in band-nesting regions close to Fermi level. Generally, the studied transitions are optically active, exhibiting in-plane polarization of light. Finally, we quantify their energy trends under external hydrostatic, uniaxial, and biaxial stresses by determining the linear pressure coefficients. Generally, negative pressure coefficients are obtained implying the narrowing of the band gap. The semiconducting-to-metal transition are predicted under hydrostatic pressure. We discuss these trends in terms of orbital composition of involved electronic bands. In addition, we demonstrate that the measured pressure coefficients of HfS2 and HfSe2 absorption edges are in perfect agreement with our predictions. Comprehensive and easy-to-interpret tables containing the optical features are provided to form the basis for assignation of optical peaks in future measurements. ",
