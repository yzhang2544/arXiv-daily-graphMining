    "abstract": "Integrated electro-optic (EO) modulators are fundamental photonics components with utility in domains ranging from digital communications to quantum information processing. At telecommunication wavelengths, thin-film lithium niobate modulators exhibit state-of-the-art performance in voltage-length product ($V_\\pi$L), optical loss, and EO bandwidth. However, applications in optical imaging, optogenetics, and quantum science generally require devices operating in the visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) wavelength range. In this work, we realize VNIR amplitude and phase modulators featuring $V_\\pi$L's of sub-1 V$\\cdot\\,$cm, low optical loss, and high bandwidth EO response. Our Mach-Zehnder modulators exhibit a $V_\\pi$L as low as 0.55 V$\\cdot\\,$cm at 738 nm, and EO bandwidths in excess of 35 GHz. Furthermore, we highlight the new opportunities these high-performance modulators offer by demonstrating the first integrated EO frequency combs at VNIR wavelengths, with over 50 lines and tunable spacing, and the first frequency shifting of pulsed light beyond its intrinsic bandwidth (up to 7x Fourier limit) by an EO shearing method.

    "title": "Electro-optic transduction in silicon via GHz-frequency nanomechanics",
    "abstract": "Interfacing electronics with optical fiber networks is key to the long-distance transfer of classical and quantum information. Piezo-optomechanical transducers enable such interfaces by using GHz-frequency acoustic vibrations as mediators for converting microwave photons to optical photons via the combination of optomechanical and piezoelectric interactions. However, despite successful demonstrations, efficient piezo-optomechanical transduction remains out of reach due to the challenges associated with hybrid material integration and increased loss from piezoelectric materials when operating in the quantum regime. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach in which we actuate 5-GHz phonons in a conventional silicon-on-insulator platform. In our experiment, microwave photons resonantly drive a phononic crystal oscillator via the electrostatic force realized in a charge-biased narrow-gap capacitor. The mechanical vibrations are subsequently transferred via a phonon waveguide to an optomechanical cavity, where they transform into optical photons in the sideband of a pump laser field. Operating at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, we measure a microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency of $1.8 \\times 10^{-7}$ in a 3.3 MHz bandwidth, and demonstrate efficient phase modulation with a half-wave voltage of $V_\\pi = 750 $ mV. Our results mark a stepping stone towards quantum transduction with integrated devices made from crystalline silicon, which promise efficient high-bandwidth operation, and integration with superconducting qubits. Additionally, the lack of need for piezoelectricity or other intrinsic nonlinearities makes our approach adaptable to a wide range of materials for potential applications beyond quantum technologies.

The intensified camera was successfully used for measurements in a variety of applications including quantum applications. As an example of such application, which requires simultaneous detection of multiple photons, we describe registration of photon pairs from the spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in a spectrometer.

    "abstract": "Bose-Einstein condensates are a promising platform for optical quantum memories, but suffer from several decoherence mechanisms, leading to short memory lifetimes. While some of these decoherence effects can be mitigated by conventional methods, density dependent atom-atom collisions ultimately set the upper limit of quantum memory lifetime to s-timescales in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. We propose a new quantum memory technique that utilizes microgravity as a resource to minimize such density-dependent effects. We show that by using optical atom lenses to collimate and refocus the freely expanding atomic ensembles, in an ideal environment, the expected memory lifetime is only limited by the quality of the background vacuum. We anticipate that this method can be experimentally demonstrated in Earth-bound microgravity platforms or space missions, eventually leading to storage times of minutes and unprecedented time-bandwidth products of {$10^{10}$} ",

Albert Einstein applied Bose's idea to a gas made of atoms and predicted a new state of matter now called Bose-Einstein condensate. It took 70 years to observe the predicted condensation phenomenon in the laboratory. With a brief introduction to the formative period of Professor Bose, this research survey begins with the founding works on quantum statistics and, subsequently, provides a brief account of the series of events terminating in the experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation.

    "abstract": "The persistent debate about the reality of a quantum state has recently come under limelight because of its importance to quantum information and the quantum computing community. Almost all of the deliberations are taking place using the elegant and powerful but abstract Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics developed with seminal contributions from John von Neumann. Since it is rather difficult to get a direct perception of the events in an abstract vector space, it is hard to trace the progress of a phenomenon. Among the multitude of recent attempts to show the reality of the quantum state in Hilbert space, the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theory gets most recognition for their proof. But some of its assumptions have been criticized, which are still not considered to be entirely loophole free. A straightforward proof of the reality of the wave packet function of a single particle has been presented earlier based on the currently recognized fundamental reality of the universal quantum fields. Quantum states like the atomic energy levels comprising the wave packets have been shown to be just as real. Here we show that an unambiguous proof of reality of the quantum states gleaned from the reality of quantum fields can also provide an explicit substantiation of the reality of quantum states in Hilbert space.

Optically active materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers can be placed in the near-field region of such Mie resonators. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and verify by numerical simulations coupling between a MoSe2 monolayer and the near-field of dielectric nanoresonators. Through a comparison of dark-field (DF) scattering spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation experiments (PLE), we show that the MoSe2 absorption can be enhanced via the near-field of a nanoresonator. We demonstrate spectral tuning of the absorption via the geometry of individual Mie resonators. We show that we indeed access the optical near-field of the nanoresonators, by measuring a spectral shift between the typical near-field resonances in PLE compared to the far-field resonances in DF scattering. Our results prove that using MoSe2 as an active probe allows accessing the optical near-field above photonic nanostructures, without the requirement of highly complex near-field microscopy equipment.

    "abstract": "We present an approach for microring dispersion engineering based on near-arbitrary control of the frequencies of resonator modes by counter-propagative coupling through an inscribed photonic crystal on the ring inner surface. This is achieved through a superposition of azimuthal ring width modulations, with each constituent modulation period determined by the azimuthal momentum of the targeted mode and modulation amplitude determined by the amount of frequency splitting required. We find that the most straightforward implementation of such a Fourier synthesis approach is limited, however, particularly when the modulation amplitude becomes comparable to the ring width, as spurious effects such as cavity-like localization and higher-order mode coupling occur, making the modal resonance splitting unpredictable. By carefully considering the impact of polarization and the role of the total modulated effective refractive index, we present a predictable and accurate design approach to achieve an arbitrary modal splitting envelope across dozens of microring modes while retaining high quality factors. Using this advance in dispersion engineering, we discuss through simulation the impact that such Fourier synthesis dispersion engineering can have on the landscape of ultra-broadband dissipative Kerr solitons, including multi-color solitons that are supported by complex dispersion profiles.

    "abstract": "Identification of non-amplified DNA sequences and single-base mutations is essential for molecular biology and genetic diagnostics. This paper reports a novel sensor consisting of electrochemically-gated graphene coplanar waveguides coupled with a microfluidic channel. Upon exposure to analytes, propagation of electromagnetic waves in the waveguides is modified as a result of interactions with the fringing field and modulation of graphene dynamic conductivity resulting from electrostatic gating. Probe DNA sequences are immobilised on the graphene surface, and the sensor is exposed to DNA sequences either perfectly matching the probe or containing a single-base mismatch. By monitoring the scattering parameters at frequencies between 50 MHz and 50 GHz, unambiguous and reproducible discrimination of single-base mismatch strands is achieved at concentrations as low as 1 attomole per litre (1 aM). By controlling and synchronising frequency sweeps, electrochemical gating, and liquid flow in the microfluidic channel, the sensor generates multidimensional datasets, leveraging the use of advanced data analysis techniques. By applying different machine learning methods, a classification accuracy >95% between single-base mismatches and perfect matches is achieved, even in the presence of simulated noise and low signal-to-noise ratios. The sensor exceeds state-of-the-art sensitivity for the identification of single-base mismatches of field-effect transistors and microwave sensors. ",

Resulting numerical solutions are compared with the well-known results obtained for a metal-dielectric interface (achiral case). Comparisons show that the chiral case exhibits smaller phase speeds than the achiral case. Such a longitudinal deceleration in the chiral case is caused by the energy expended on establishing the longitudinal spin density, which turns out anti-symmetric with respect to medium chirality. Moreover, the low-frequency range is disallowed in the chiral case. Relevant energy redistributions, spin-orbital couplings, and applications are discussed. ",

We argue that there is a single general interpretive framework with a common core to which all these interpretations are committed, so that they can be regarded as different instances of it, with some of their differences being mostly a matter of emphasis and degree. We also identify, however, remaining differences of a more substantial nature, and we offer a first analysis of them. We also argue that these remaining differences cannot be resolved within the formalism of quantum mechanics itself and identify the more general philosophical considerations that can be used in order to break this interpretation underdetermination.
