    "title": "Design of Novel Optical Cavities for Strong Shock Compression",
    "abstract": "Laser-induced strong shock with high efficiency remains a technical challenge, evidenced by the fact that much effort is being invested at large-scale national laboratories to optimize the laser-induced shock compression of pellets consisting of light elements. However, techniques developed at national laboratories are rarely transferable to university laboratories. Here, we present theoretical work on designing novel optical cavities intended for strong shock generation at a tabletop scale. The key idea is to utilize multiple laser pulses spatially shaped to form concentric laser rings on condensed matter samples. Each laser ring launches a 2D focusing pressure wave that converges at the common central point. The pulses are delayed in the nanosecond range and spaced by microns, matching the laser scanning speed to the shock speed, which is typically several microns/ns in condensed matter, allowing the pressure waves to superimpose to achieve extremely high pressure. The hereby designed optical cavities are expected to maintain or even exceed the shock excitation efficiency of $10^4$ GPa/J reported in our previous work using a single laser ring, where the limiting factor to generate stronger shocks was the saturation of input laser energy. The current design for multiple laser rings bypasses the saturation due to much larger excitation areas, thus the total input laser energy can be dramatically increased. Our work provides a viable pathway toward the application of laser-induced strong shock compression of condensed matters. The current tabletop scheme caters to the need of the shock compression community by providing the flexibility, in contrast to large-scale national labs, to test new shock compression strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Octave-wide frequency combs in microresonators are essential for self-referencing. However, it is difficult for the small-size and high-repetition-rate microresonators to achieve perfect soliton modelocking over the broad frequency range due to the detrimental impact of dispersion. Here we examine the stability of the soliton states consisting of one hundred modes in silicon-nitride microresonators with the one-THz free spectral range. We report the coexistence of fast and slow solitons in a narrow detuning range, which is surrounded on either side by the breather states. We decompose the breather combs into a sequence of subcombs with different carrier envelope offset frequencies. The large detuning breathers have a high frequency of oscillations associated with the perturbation extending across the whole microresonator. The small detuning breathers create oscillations localised on the soliton core and can undergo the period-doubling bifurcation, which triggers a sequence of intense sub-combs. ",

    "abstract": "Increasing power demands on multicore processors necessitate effective thermal management. The present study investigates natural convection heat transfer inside a square cavity with an alternately active bi-heater that mimics two cores of a dual-core processor. Pulsating heat flux condition is implemented on two discrete heaters with a certain switching frequency. The heat transfer characteristics have been investigated for Prandtl number =0.71 and Rayleigh number in the range of 10^3 - 10^6 using OpenFOAM. The results obtained for alternative active heaters configuration have been compared with that of the steady single heater and steady double-symmetric heaters subjected to the same heat flux. The alternately active heater configuration showed better heat transfer characteristics than a single steady heater for all switchover periods, and better than a double-symmetric heater for low switchover periods. However, it is found that for higher values of the switchover period, the maximum temperature of alternately active heaters configuration touches the temperature of steady single heater. This threshold switchover period has been determined using a scale analysis. The threshold switchover periods determined from scale analysis are consistent with the results obtained from numerical simulations for different Rayleigh numbers and heater lengths. ",

One-dimensional spectral (infinite-dimensional) and finite element (finite-dimensional) models for plane acoustic waves in ducts are used. It is shown that dispersion diagrams of this family of metamaterials exhibit non-reciprocal imaginary frequency components, manifesting as wave attenuation or amplification along opposite directions for all pass bands. The effects of different feedback laws are investigated. Furthermore, the non-Hermitian skin effect manifesting as topological modes localized at the boundaries of finite domains is investigated and successfully predicted by the topology of the reciprocal space. This work extends previous numerical results obtained for a piezoelectric rod system and contributes to recent efforts in designing active metamaterials with novel properties associated with the physics of non-Hermitian systems, which may find fruitful technological applications related to noise control, wave localization, filtering and multiplexing.

    "title": "Nonlinear multi-frequency phonon lasers with active levitated  optomechanics",
    "abstract": "Phonon lasers, exploiting coherent amplifications of phonons, have been a cornerstone for exploring nonlinear phononics, imaging nanomaterial structures, and operating phononic devices. Very recently, by levitating a nanosphere in an optical tweezer, a single-mode phonon laser governed by dispersive optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated, assisted by alternating mechanical nonlinear cooling and linear heating. Such levitated optomechanical (LOM) devices, with minimal noises in high vacuum, can allow flexible control of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However, untill now, it is still elusive to realize phonon lasing with levitated microscale objects, due to much stronger optical scattering losses. Here, by employing a Yb3+-doped active system, we report the first experiment on nonlinear multi-frequency phonon lasers with a micro-size sphere governed instead by dissipative LOM coupling. In this work, active gain plays a key role since not only 3-order enhancement can be achieved for the amplitude of the fundamental-mode phonon lasing, compared with the passive device, but also nonlinear mechanical harmonics can emerge spontaneously above the lasing threshold. Furthermore, for the first time, coherent correlations of phonons are observed for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work drives the field of LOM technology into a new regime where it becomes promising to engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects, such as atmospheric particulates and living cells, for a wide range of applications in e.g., acoustic sensing, gravimetry, and inertial navigation.

Coherent states and their overcompleteness properties along with the diagonal representation of the density matrix are essential as a prerequisite to reproduce the result. Most of the textbooks meant for graduate students describe linear harmonic oscillators in great detail but they cryptically mention coherent states and their associated properties. So it is difficult for the students to understand the essence of Sudarshans paper which contains only seven equations.

    "abstract": "A workflow is presented for performing pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of defected materials using structures generated from atomistic simulations. A large collection of structures, which differ in the types and concentrations of defects present, are obtained through energy minimization with an empirical interatomic potential. Each of the structures is refined against an experimental PDF. The structures with the lowest goodness of fit $R_w$ values are taken as being representative of the experimental structure. The workflow is applied to anatase titanium dioxide ($a$-TiO$_2$) and tetragonal zirconium dioxide ($t$-ZrO$_2$) synthesized in the presence of microwave radiation, a low temperature process that generates disorder. The results suggest that titanium vacancies and interstitials are the dominant defects in $a$-TiO$_2$, while oxygen vacancies dominate in $t$-ZrO$_2$. Analysis of the atomic displacement parameters extracted from the PDF refinement and mean squared displacements calculated from molecular dynamics simulations indicate that while these two quantities are closely related, it is challenging to make quantitative comparisons between them. The workflow can be applied to other materials systems, including nanoparticles. ",

    "abstract": "Cavity-mediated magnon-magnon coupling can lead to a transfer of spin-wave excitations between two spatially separated magnetic samples. We enunciate how the application of a two-photon parametric drive to the cavity can lead to stark amplification in this transfer efficiency. The recurrent multiphoton absorption by the cavity opens up an infinite ladder of accessible energy levels, which can induce higher-order transitions within the magnon Fock space. This is reflected in a heightened spin-current response from one of the magnetic samples when the neighboring sample is coherently pumped. The enhancement induced by the parametric drive can be considerably high within the stable dynamical region. Specifically, near the periphery of the stability boundary, the spin current is amplified by several orders of magnitude. Such striking enhancement factors are attributed to the emergence of parametrically induced strong coherences precipitated by a long-lived mode. While contextualized in magnonics, the generality of the principle would allow applications to energy transfer between systems contained in parametric cavities. ",

Here we demonstrate, for the first time, on-demand entanglement of individually prepared molecules.

Our results demonstrate the key building blocks needed for quantum information processing, simulation of quantum spin models, and quantum-enhanced sensing.
