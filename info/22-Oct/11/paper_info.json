    "title": "Steering line waves at a dual metasurface for optical applications",
    "abstract": "Line waves are defined as confined edge modes propagating at the interface of dual electromagnetic metasurfaces that preserve mirror reflection symmetries. Previous works have theoretically and practically explored these waves, showing that they occur at microwave regimes and terahertz ranges. It is also demonstrated that line waves can happen when there is a symmetric resistance discontinuity from negative to positive values and a uniform surface reactance. Line waves are of tunable mode confinement, direction-dependent polarizations, and singular field enhancement. This study presents a graphene patch design and demonstrates that the line waves associated with this structure can travel in the optical domain. Our design consists of a graphene metasurface on an epsilon near zero (ENZ) substrate. While our approach considers both dual reactive impedances and homogenous reactive ones, we only concentrate on line wave utilization in a dual-impedance structure. ",

A spherical non-absorbing particle cannot rotate due to the conservation of the angular momentum of light upon scattering. Here, we suggest a novel physical mechanism for the angular momentum transfer to non-absorbing particles via nonlinear light scattering. The breaking of symmetry occurs at the microscopic level manifested in nonlinear negative optical torque due to the excitation of resonant states at the harmonic frequency with higher projection of angular momentum. The proposed physical mechanism can be verified with resonant dielectric nanostructures, and we suggest some specific realizations. ",

    "abstract": "Focused ion beam (FIB) has been used as an effective tool for precise nanoscale fabrication. It has recently been employed to tailor defect engineering in functional nanomaterials such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), providing desirable properties in TMDC-based optoelectronic devices. However, the damage caused by the FIB irradiation and milling process to these delicate atomically thin materials, especially in the extended area, has not yet been elaboratively characterised. Understanding the correlation between lateral ion beam effects and optical properties of 2D TMDCs is crucial in designing and fabricating high-performance optoelectronic devices. In this work, we investigate lateral damage in large-area monolayer WS2 caused by the gallium focused ion beam milling process. Three distinct zones away from the milling location are identified and characterised via steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy. An unexpected bright ring-shaped emission around the milled location has been revealed by time-resolved PL spectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Our finding opens new avenues for tailoring the optical properties of TMDCs by charge and defect engineering via focused ion beam lithography. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that while some localised damage is inevitable, distant destruction can be eliminated by reducing the ion beam current. It paves the way for the use of FIB to create nanostructures in 2D TMDCs, as well as the design and realisation of optoelectrical devices on a wafer scale. ",

Based on this, an attempt is made to explain the difference in the measurements of hyperon yields in the two experiments - NA49 and NA57. Using the basic principles of quantum mechanics, it was shown that a fireball can have two quantum states - with and without ignited Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). With an increase of the collision energy of heavy ions, the probability of QGP ignition increases. At the same time, the probability of the formation of fireball without QGP ignition also remains nonzero even at nuclear collision energies that are much higher than the threshold QGP formation energy, which may be erroneously considered to be fixed and which is intensively sought in modern heavy ion accelerators. Thus, at SPS energy of heavy ion collisions \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 17.3 GeV, which is much higher than the assumed threshold energy of QGP formation in the region around or slightly above of \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3 GeV, only half of the central collisions of heavy ions bring to the formation of a fireball consisted of deconfined matter, the remaining half of the collisions lead to the formation of a fireball from only hadronic matter.

Recently, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning have been been introduced to the task of designing thin-films with great success, however a trained network is usually only able to become proficient for a single target and must be retrained if the optical targets are varied. In this work, we apply conditional Invertible Neural Networks (cINN) to inversely designing multilayer thin-films given an optical target. Since the cINN learns the energy landscape of all thin-film configurations within the training dataset, we show that cINNs can generate a stochastic ensemble of proposals for thin-film configurations that that are reasonably close to the desired target depending only on random variables. By refining the proposed configurations further by a local optimization, we show that the generated thin-films reach the target with significantly greater precision than comparable state-of-the art approaches. Furthermore, we tested the generative capabilities on samples which are outside the training data distribution and found that the cINN was able to predict thin-films for out-of-distribution targets, too. The results suggest that in order to improve the generative design of thin-films, it is instructive to use established and new machine learning methods in conjunction in order to obtain the most favorable results.

The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is increased in a continuous fashion from 43 dB to 60 dB. This was achieved by summing user-selected rows which were read out multiple times.

    "abstract": "We present a method for computing the inverse parameters and the solution field to inverse parametric PDEs based on randomized neural networks. This extends the local extreme learning machine technique originally developed for forward PDEs to inverse problems. We develop three algorithms for training the neural network to solve the inverse PDE problem. The first algorithm (NLLSQ) determines the inverse parameters and the trainable network parameters all together by the nonlinear least squares method with perturbations (NLLSQ-perturb). The second algorithm (VarPro-F1) eliminates the inverse parameters from the overall problem by variable projection to attain a reduced problem about the trainable network parameters only. It solves the reduced problem first by the NLLSQ-perturb algorithm for the trainable network parameters, and then computes the inverse parameters by the linear least squares method. The third algorithm (VarPro-F2) eliminates the trainable network parameters from the overall problem by variable projection to attain a reduced problem about the inverse parameters only. It solves the reduced problem for the inverse parameters first, and then computes the trainable network parameters afterwards. VarPro-F1 and VarPro-F2 are reciprocal to each other in a sense. The presented method produces accurate results for inverse PDE problems, as shown by the numerical examples herein. For noise-free data, the errors for the inverse parameters and the solution field decrease exponentially as the number of collocation points or the number of trainable network parameters increases, and can reach a level close to the machine accuracy. For noisy data, the accuracy degrades compared with the case of noise-free data, but the method remains quite accurate. The presented method has been compared with the physics-informed neural network method. ",

However, such active systems must be causal, stable, and carefully tuned to be practical and applicable to precision measurements. In this paper, we show that phase-insensitive amplification in laser interferometers can be implemented in a tabletop experiment. The layout consists of two coupled cavities and an active medium comprised of a silicon nitride membrane and an auxiliary pump field. Our design relies on existing membrane and cryogenic technology and can demonstrate three distinct features: (i) the self-stabilized dynamics of the optical system, (ii) quantum enhancement of its sensitivity in the presence of the amplifier, and (iii) optical control of the amplifier gain.

Although never adopted for its intended purpose, the notion of a skyrmion as a topologically stable field configuration has proven highly versatile, finding application in condensed matter physics, acoustics and more recently optics, but realizations as entanged states has remained elusive. Here we report the first non-local quantum entangled state with a non-trivial topology that is skyrmionic in nature, even though each photon individually has no topological structure. We reveal the deep connection between entanglement and topology, giving rise to a new mechanism that we coin topological noise rejection, where the topology of the quantum wavefunction makes such quantum states robust to entanglement decay, remaining intact until the entanglement itself vanishes. Our findings hold exciting promise for the creation and preservation of quantum information by topologically structured quantum states that persist even when entanglement is fragile. ",

Photon collection efficiencies directly impact the amount of resources required for measurement-based quantum computation and communication networks. Promising resources include solid-state quantum light sources, however, efficiently coupling light from a single quantum emitter to a guided mode remains demanding. In this work, we eliminate photon losses by maximizing coupling efficiencies in an emitter-to-fiber interface. We develop a waveguide-integrated 'Sawfish' photonic crystal cavity and use finite element simulations to demonstrate that our system transfers, with 97.4% efficiency, the zero-phonon line emission of a negatively-charged tin vacancy center in diamond adiabatically to a single-mode fiber. A surrogate model trained by machine learning provides quantitative estimates of sensitivities to fabrication tolerances. Our corrugation-based design proves robust under state-of-the-art nanofabrication parameters, maintaining an emitter-to-fiber coupling efficiency of 88.6%. To demonstrate its potential in reducing resource requirements, we apply the Sawfish cavity to a recent one-way quantum repeater protocol. ",
