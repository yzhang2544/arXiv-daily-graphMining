    "title": "Decreasing ultrafast X-ray pulse durations with saturable absorption and  resonant transitions",
    "abstract": "Saturable absorption is a nonlinear effect where a material's ability to absorb light is frustrated due to a high influx of photons and the creation of electron vacancies. Experimentally induced saturable absorption in copper revealed a reduction in the temporal duration of transmitted X-ray laser pulses, but a complete understanding of this process is still missing. In this computational work, we employ non-local thermodynamic equilibrium plasma simulations to study the interaction of femtosecond X-rays and copper. Following the onset of frustrated absorption, we find that a $K\\text{--}M$ resonant transition occurring at highly charged states turns copper opaque again. The changes in absorption generate a transient transparent window responsible for the shortened transmission signal. We also propose using fluorescence induced by the incident beam as an alternative source to achieve shorter X-ray pulses. Intense femtosecond X-ray pulses are valuable to probe the structure and dynamics of biological samples or to reach extreme states of matter. Shortened pulses could be relevant for emerging imaging techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic modes in dielectric nanostructures, e.g., wide gap semiconductor like CeO2 (ceria), has potential for various applications such as light harvesting and information transmission. To fully understand the properties of such phenomenon in nanoscale, we applied electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to detect such modes in a well-defined ceria nanocube. Through spectra and mapping, we demonstrated a geometrical difference of mode excitation. By comparing various spectra taken at different location relative to the cube, we also showed the transmission properties of the mode. To confirm our observation, we performed EELS simulation with finite-element dielectric calculations in COMSOL Multiphysics. We also revealed the origin of the modes through the calculation. We purposed a simple analytical model to estimate the energy of photonic modes as well. In all, this work gave a fine description of the photonic modes' properties in nanostructures, while demonstrating the advantage of EELS in characterizing optical phenomena in nanoscale. ",

    "abstract": "The enantiopurification of racemic mixtures of chiral molecules is important for a range of applications. Recent work has shown that chiral group-directed photoisomerization is a promising approach to enantioenrich racemic mixtures of BINOL, but increased control of the diasteriomeric excess (de) is necessary for its broad utility. Here we develop a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) generalization of time-dependent density functional theory and demonstrate computationally that strong light-matter coupling can alter the de of chiral group-directed photoisomerization of BINOL. The relative orientation of the cavity mode polarization and the molecules in the cavity dictates the nature of the cavity interactions, which either enhance the de of the (R)-BINOL diasteriomer (from 17% to $\\approx$ 40%) or invert the favorability to the (S)-BINOL derivative (to $\\approx$ 34% de). The latter outcome is particularly remarkable because it indicates that the preference in diasteriomer can be influenced via orientational control, without changing the chirality of the directing group. We demonstrate that the observed effect stems from cavity-induced changes to the Kohn-Sham orbitals of the ground state. ",

We constructed several microresonator-based laser sources with measured instantaneous linewidths of 1 Hz and used them for investigation and implementation of the self-injection locking effect. We studied analytically and experimentally the dependence of the stabilization coefficient on tunable parameters such as locking phase and coupling rate. It was shown that precise control of the locking phase allows fine tuning of the generated frequency from the stabilized laser diode. We also showed that it is possible for such laser sources to realize fast continuous and linear frequency modulation by injection current tuning inside the self-injection locking regime. We conceptually demonstrate coherent frequency-modulated continuous wave LIDAR over a distance of 10 km using such a microresonator-stabilized laser diode in the frequency-chirping regime and measure velocities as low as sub-micrometer per second in the unmodulated case.

    "abstract": "The realization of lossless metasurfaces with true chirality crucially requires the fabrication of three-dimensional structures, constraining their feasibility for experiments and hampering practical implementations. Even though the three-dimensional assembly of metallic nanostructures has been demonstrated previously, the resulting plasmonic resonances suffer from high intrinsic and radiative losses. The concept of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) is instrumental for tailoring radiative losses in diverse geometries, especially when implemented using lossless dielectrics, but applications have so far been limited to planar and intrinsically achiral structures. Here, we introduce a novel nanofabrication approach to unlock the height of generally flat all-dielectric metasurfaces as an accessible parameter for efficient resonance and functionality control. In particular, we realize out-of-plane symmetry breaking in quasi-BIC metasurfaces and leverage this design degree of freedom to demonstrate, for the first time, an optical all-dielectric quasi-BIC metasurface with maximum intrinsic chirality that responds selectively to light of a particular circular polarization depending on the structural handedness. Our experimental results not only open a new paradigm for all-dielectric BICs and chiral nanophotonics but also promise advances in the realization of efficient generation of optical angular momentum, holographic metasurfaces, and parity-time symmetry-broken optical systems.

    "abstract": "The goal of a LLRF system is to control an actual RF cavity with beam. While digital simulations have a place, having an analog circuit to stand in for the cavity can be tremendously helpful in validating hardware+firmware+software under development. A wide range of cavity emulators have been developed in collaboration with SLAC, and LBNL. Cavity emulators are typically based on quartz crystals and frequency conversion hardware. The choice of crystal frequency and coupling mechanism depends in part on the bandwidth and coupling of the cavity it's intended to emulate. Examples of bandwidth range from 800 Hz (SLAC) as a stand-in for a SRF cavity, to 31 kHz (LBNL) for a room-temperature accumulator ring cavity. An external LO is used to tune the emulated cavity frequency. The coupling properties are also of interest if the scope includes emulating reverse power waveforms. LLRF system checks such as closed-loop bandwidth, and determining cavity detuning can be performed interactively and as part of a Continuous Integration (CI) process. This paper describes the design, implementation, and performance of the cavity emulators. ",

Using full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that in this regime, cross-filament stochastic acceleration is an important mechanism that contributes to the production of superponderomotive, high-flux electron beams. Since the laser power significantly exceeds the threshold of the relativistic self-focusing, multiple filaments are generated and can propagate independently over a long distance. Electrons jump across the filaments during the acceleration, and their motion becomes stochastic. We find that the effective temperature of electrons increases with the total interaction time following a scaling like $T_{\\rm eff}\\propto\\tau_{i}^{0.65}$. By irradiating a submillimeter thick NCD target, the space charge of electrons with energy above 2.5 MeV reaches tens of $\\mu$C. Such high-flux electrons with superponderomotive energies significantly facilitate applications in high-energy-density science, nuclear science, secondary sources and diagnostic techniques. ",

They offer great opportunities to extract subtle and deep information about optical properties of materials with simpler optical setups, which would otherwise require sophisticated instrumentation. In this work, we propose a computational ellipsometry approach based on a conventional tabletop optical microscope and a deep learning model called EllipsoNet. Without any prior knowledge about the multilayer substrates, EllipsoNet can predict the complex refractive indices of thin films on top of these nontrivial substrates from experimentally measured optical reflectance spectra with high accuracies. This task was not feasible previously with traditional reflectometry or ellipsometry methods. Fundamental physical principles, such as the Kramers-Kronig relations, are spontaneously learned by the model without any further training.

We derive analytical conditions for a sustained emission and show that the ultimate linewidth is set by the fundamental quantum fluctuations of the collective atomic dipole.

We also present a general framework that is applicable to other figures of merit beyond memory efficiency. These results have practical ramifications for quantum memory experiments. ",

    "title": "Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Polariton Chemistry",
    "abstract": "We employ an exact quantum mechanical simulation technique to investigate a model of cavity-modified chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The model contains the coupling of the reaction coordinate to a generic solvent, cavity coupling to either the reaction coordinate or a non-reactive mode, and the coupling of the cavity to lossy modes. Thus, many of the most important features needed for realistic modeling of the cavity modification of chemical reactions are included. We find that when a molecule is coupled to an optical cavity it is essential to treat the problem quantum mechanically in order to obtain a quantitative account of alterations to reactivity. We find sizable and sharp changes in the rate constant that are associated with quantum mechanical state splittings and resonances. The features that emerge from our simulations are closer to those observed in experiments than are previous calculations, even for realistically small values of coupling and cavity loss. This work highlights the importance of a fully quantum treatment of vibrational polariton chemistry. ",

    "abstract": "We describe the RF Quantum Upconverter (RQU) and describe its application to quantum metrology of electromagnetic modes between dc and the Very High Frequency band (VHF) ($\\lesssim$300MHz). The RQU uses a Josephson interferometer made up of superconducting loops and Josephson junctions to implement a parametric interaction between a low-frequency electromagnetic mode (between dc and VHF) and a mode in the microwave C Band ($\\sim$ 5GHz), analogous to the radiation pressure interaction between electromagnetic and mechanical modes in cavity optomechanics. The RQU can operate as a quantum-limited op-amp, or use protocols from optomechanics to implement non-classical measurement protocols equivalent to those used in cavity optomechanics, including back-action evading (BAE) measurements, sideband cooling, and two-mode squeezing. These protocols enable experiments using dc-VHF electromagnetic modes as quantum sensors. ",

    "abstract": "Single-Photon Avalanche Detector (SPAD) arrays are a rapidly emerging technology. These multi-pixel sensors have single-photon sensitivities and pico-second temporal resolutions thus they can rapidly generate depth images with millimeter precision. Such sensors are a key enabling technology for future autonomous systems as they provide guidance and situational awareness. However, to fully exploit the capabilities of SPAD array sensors, it is crucial to establish the quality of depth images they are able to generate in a wide range of scenarios. Given a particular optical system and a finite image acquisition time, what is the best-case depth resolution and what are realistic images generated by SPAD arrays? In this work, we establish a robust yet simple numerical procedure that rapidly establishes the fundamental limits to depth imaging with SPAD arrays under real world conditions. Our approach accurately generates realistic depth images in a wide range of scenarios, allowing the performance of an optical depth imaging system to be established without the need for costly and laborious field testing. This procedure has applications in object detection and tracking for autonomous systems and could be easily extended to systems for underwater imaging or for imaging around corners. ",
