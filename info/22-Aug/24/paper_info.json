    "title": "SLAC Microresonator RF (SMuRF) Electronics: A tone-tracking readout  system for superconducting microwave resonator arrays",
    "abstract": "We describe the newest generation of the SLAC Microresonator RF (SMuRF) electronics, a warm digital control and readout system for microwave-frequency resonator-based cryogenic detector and multiplexer systems such as microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\\mu$mux) or microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). Ultra-sensitive measurements in particle physics and astronomy increasingly rely on large arrays of cryogenic sensors, which in turn necessitate highly multiplexed readout and accompanying room-temperature electronics. Microwave-frequency resonators are a popular tool for cryogenic multiplexing, with the potential to multiplex thousands of detector channels on one readout line. The SMuRF system provides the capability for reading out up to 3328 channels across a 4-8 GHz bandwidth. Notably, the SMuRF system is unique in its implementation of a closed-loop tone-tracking algorithm that minimizes RF power transmitted to the cold amplifier, substantially relaxing system linearity requirements and effective noise from intermodulation products. Here we present a description of the hardware, firmware, and software systems of the SMuRF electronics, comparing achieved performance with science-driven design requirements. We focus in particular on the case of large channel count, low bandwidth applications, but the system has been easily reconfigured for high bandwidth applications. The system described here has been successfully deployed in lab settings and field sites around the world and is baselined for use on upcoming large-scale observatories. ",

    "abstract": "Multicore optical fibers and ribbons based on fiber arrays allow for massively parallel transmission of signals via spatially separated channels, thereby offering attractive bandwidth scaling with linearly increasing technical effort. However, low-loss coupling of light between fiber arrays or multicore fibers and standard linear arrays of vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) or photodiodes (PD) still represents a challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D-printed facet-attached microlenses (FaML) offer an attractive path for connecting multimode fiber arrays as well as individual cores of multimode multicore fibers to standard arrays of VCSEL or PD. The freeform coupling elements are printed in situ with high precision on the device and fiber facets by high-resolution multi-photon lithography. We demonstrate coupling losses down to 0.35 dB along with lateral 1 dB alignment tolerances in excess of 10 um, allowing to leverage fast passive assembly techniques that rely on industry standard machine vision. To the best of our knowledge, our experiments represent the first demonstration of a coupling interface that connects individual cores of a multicore fiber to VCSEL or PD arranged in a standard linear array without the need for additional fiber- or waveguide-based fan-out structures. Using this approach, we build a 3 x 25 Gbit/s transceiver assembly which fits into a small form-factor pluggable module and which complies with the requirements for 100GBASE-SR4 transceivers according to the IEEE 802.3 standard.

As predicted in numerical simulations, the obtained pulse structures have ringing, i.e., a train of subpulses following the main pulse. Owing to the phase retrieval with a combination of linear and nonlinear autocorrelation measurements, the temporal phase was also obtained with the pulse shape, and $\\pi$-phase jumps between each pulse were confirmed. This particular pulse shape with $\\pi$-phase jumps is a common feature of Burnham-Chiao ringing or superradiance ringing. Using unaveraged FEL simulations, the ringing was found to originate from repeated formation and deformation of microbunches across successive bunch slices. The simulation results imply that there should be superluminal propagation of the FEL pulse due to strong gain modulation along the undulator of the FEL oscillator. ",

Several surfaces and subsurface micro defects develop within the Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) sensor due to delamination, corrosion, huge temperature fluctuation, etc., causing a decline in its performance. It is thus necessary to identify, locate, and quantify the defects. Non-Destructive Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is the most optimal and economical method of evaluation. Traditional ultrasound SHM techniques have a huge impedance mismatch between air and any solid material. And most of the popular signal processing methods define time-series signals in only one domain which gives sub-optimal results. Thus to improve the accuracy of detection point contact excitation and detection methods have been implemented to determine the interaction of ultrasonic waves with microscale defects in the PZT. And Haar Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) is applied to the time series data obtained from the Coulomb coupling setup. Using the above process, defect up to 100 um in diameter could be successfully distinguished and localized. ",

    "abstract": "The photonic lantern (PL) is a tapered waveguide that can efficiently couple light into multiple single-mode optical fibers. Such devices are currently being considered for a number of tasks, including the coupling of telescopes and high-resolution, fiber-fed spectrometers, coherent detection, nulling interferometry, and vortex-fiber nulling (VFN). In conjunction with these use cases, PLs can simultaneously perform low-order focal-plane wavefront sensing. In this work, we provide a mathematical framework for the analysis of the photonic lantern wavefront sensor (PLWFS), deriving linear and higher-order reconstruction models as well as metrics through which sensing performance -- both in the linear and nonlinear regimes -- can be quantified. This framework can be extended to account for additional optics such as beam-shaping optics and vortex masks, and is generalizable to other wavefront sensing architectures. Lastly, we provide initial numerical verification of our mathematical models, by simulating a 6-port PLWFS. In a companion paper, we provide a more comprehensive numerical characterization of few-port PLWFSs, and consider how the sensing properties of these devices can be controlled and optimized. ",

    "abstract": "Microwave-optics entanglement is a vital component for building hybrid quantum networks. Here we show how to prepare stationary entanglement between microwave and optical cavity fields in a cavity optomagnomechanical system. It consists of a magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic crystal that couples directly to a microwave cavity mode via the magnetic dipole interaction, and indirectly to an optical cavity through the deformation displacement of the crystal. The mechanical displacement is induced by the magnetostrictive force and coupled to the optical cavity via radiation pressure. Both the opto- and magnomechanical couplings are dispersive. Magnon-phonon entanglement is created via magnomechanical parametric down-conversion, which is further distributed to optical and microwave photons via simultaneous optomechanical beamsplitter interaction and electromagnonic state-swap interaction, yielding stationary microwave-optics entanglement. The microwave-optics entanglement is robust against thermal noise, which will find broad potential applications in quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems. ",

    "abstract": "Transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters and bolometers are used for a variety of applications. The sensors are based on the steep temperature-dependent resistance of the normal-to-superconducting transition, and are thus intrinsically sensitive to magnetic fields. Conventionally the detectors are shielded from stray magnetic fields using external magnetic shields. However, in particular for applications with strict limits on the available space and mass of an instrument, external magnetic shields might not be enough to obtain the required shielding factors or field homogeneity. Additionally, these shields are only effective for magnetic fields generated external to the TES array, and are ineffective to mitigate the impact of internally generated magnetic fields. Here we present an alternative shielding method based on a superconducting groundplane deposited directly on the backside of the silicon nitride membrane on which the TESs are located. We demonstrate that this local shielding for external magnetic fields has a shielding factor of at the least ~ 75, and is also effective at reducing internal self-induced magnetic fields, as demonstrated by measurements and simulation of the eddy current losses in our AC biased detectors. Measurements of 5.9 keV X-ray photons show that our shielded detectors have a high resilience to external magnetic fields, showing no degradation of the energy resolution or shifts of the energy scale calibration for fields of several microTesla, values higher than expected in typical real-world applications.
