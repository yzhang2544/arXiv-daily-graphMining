    "abstract": "A simple procedure to incorporate one-loop quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections into the generalized (Gatchina) nonlocal shape-consistent relativistic pseudopotential model is described. The pseudopotentials for Lu, Tl, and Ra replacing only inner core shells (with principal quantum numbers $n\\le 3$ for the two former elements and $n\\le 4$ for the latter one) are derived from the solutions of reference atomic SCF problems with the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian to which the model Lamb shift operator added. QED contributions to atomic valence excitation energies evaluated at the SCF level are demonstrated to exceed the errors introduced by the pseudopotential approximation itself by an order of magnitude. Pilot applications of the new model to calculations of excitation energies of two-valence-electron atomic systems using the intermediate-Hamiltonian relativistic Fock space coupled cluster method reformulated here for incomplete main model spaces are reported. Implications for high-accuracy molecular excited state calculations are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Broad area laser diodes are attractive for the high optical power they can produce. Unfortunately, this high power normally comes at the cost of severely reduced spatial coherence since the wide area of the semiconductor wave-guide is inherently spatially multi-mode (in the slow axis). We demonstrate a method to majorly improve the spatial coherence of a high-power broad-area diode laser by placing it in an external cavity that is mode selective. We design the cavity, such that the diode aperture acts as its own spatial filter, obviating the need for an intra-cavity slit-filter, and optimally utilizing the entire gain medium. We demonstrate this soft filtering method using wide diodes of $200 \\rm{\\mu m}$ and $300 \\rm{\\mu m}$ widths and compare its power-efficiency to the standard approach of hard-filtering with a slit. We obtain high-gain operation in a pure single-mode, demonstrating up to $1.5\\rm{W}$ CW power at $1064 \\rm{nm}$ with high beam quality. ",

The certification protocol is based on an adaptation of the existing quantum non-Gaussianity criteria for quantum states to quantum measurements. In our approach, it suffices to probe the detector with a vacuum state and two different thermal states to test its quantum non-Gaussianity. The certification is experimentally demonstrated for the detector formed by a spatially multiplexed array of ten single-photon avalanche photodiodes. We confirm the quantum non-Gaussianity of POVM elements $\\hat{\\Pi}_m$ associated with the $m$-fold coincidence counts, up to $m=7$. The experimental ability to certify from the first principles the quantum non-Gaussian character of $\\hat{\\Pi}_m$ is for large $m$ limited by low probability of the measurement outcomes, especially for vacuum input state. We find that the injection of independent Gaussian background noise into the detector can be helpful and may reduce the measurement time required for reliable confirmation of quantum non-Gaussianity. In addition, we modified and experimentally verified the quantum non-Gaussianity certification protocol employing a third thermal state instead of a vacuum to speed up the whole measurement. Our findings demonstrate the existence of efficient tools for the practical characterization of fundamental non-classical properties and benchmarking of complex optical quantum detectors. ",

This paper presents a rather elegant and novel way of looking at the resonance phenomenon, which among others shares a common conceptual basis in various fields of physics. For the sake of simplicity, the discussion will be restricted to the case of electric current resonance in series RLC circuits. The mathematics of electric resonance is thus meticulously extended to the extent that it ultimately unravels an invaluable relationship between the current at a certain driving frequency and that at the resonance frequency. Much further it gives rise to an elaborate correlation between any two driving frequencies that give the same current. Arising from the previously mentioned relations, a new technique is devised, a simple geometrical construction, that without running into tedious calculations, allows the computation of the phase difference between the current and the impressed voltage at any given frequency. Not to mention another geometric utility, that is miraculously constructed to correlate any frequency with its corresponding ``conjugate'' one, that allows the same current in the circuit. ",

Here we present a methodology for precise transfer and positioning of individual NPs onto different photonic nanostructures. The method is based on soft lithography printing that employs elastomeric stamp-assisted transfer of individual NPs onto a single nanostructure. It can also parallel imprint many individual NPs with high throughput and accuracy in a single step. Raman spectroscopy confirms enhanced light-matter interactions in the resulting NPoM-based devices. Our method mixes top-down and bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and shows the potential of building complex photonic nanodevices for applications ranging from enhanced sensing and spectroscopy to signal processing.

In order to improve its resolution, a Super-resolution optical fluctuation Fourier light field microscopy (SOFFLFM) was proposed here, in which the Sofi method with ability of super-resolution was introduced into FLFM. SOFFLFM uses higher-order cumulants statistical analysis on an image sequence collected by FLFM, and then carries out 3D deconvolution calculation to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sample.

Instead of considering the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, we use Timoshenko's approach instead, which is known to be more realistic at higher frequencies. Our goal is to minimize the reflection coefficient under a constraint imposed on the normalized wave number variation. We use the calculus of variations in order to derive the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation analytically and then use numerical methods to solve this equation in order to find the optimal height profile for different frequencies. We then compare these profiles to the corresponding ones previously found using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and see that in the lower range of the dimensionless frequency $\\Omega$ (defined using the largest height of the plate), the optimal profiles almost coincide, as expected. For higher such frequencies, even for values where Euler-Bernoulli theory should still be marginally valid, the profiles predicted using Euler-Bernoulli differ substantially from the correct ones predicted by Timoshenko theory. One explanation for this phenomenon is that unlike in the constant height case, in our setting the wave numbers also depend on the ratio between the smallest and the largest heights. ",

Subsequently, the simulation results are verified by comparison experiments, where distributed reflectivity measurements along a 32-m-long single-mode fiber joint with multiple connectors are performed using both conventional (with averaging) and ESA-free OCDR configurations (without averaging) at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The widths of the reflectivity peaks experimentally obtained by the conventional and ESA-free OCDR configurations are 22.9 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively. Finally, we experimentally evaluated the performance of the ESA-free OCDR at higher repetition rates, achieving 6.3-cm spatial resolution at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. This result indicates that the ESA-free OCDR can perform a distributed reflectivity measurement with an improved spatial resolution at a higher operation speed than ever. ",

The design of the cavity with hollow dielectric cylinders concentrically inserted in a OFHC Cu cavity, allowed us to maintain a loaded quality-factor Q $\\sim 300000$ during the measurements in presence of magnetic field. Through the cavity tuning mechanism it was possible to modulate the resonance frequency of the haloscope in the region $10.35337-10.35345$~GHz and thus acquire different dataset at different resonance frequencies. Acquiring each dataset for about 50 minutes, combining them and correcting for the axion's signal estimation-efficiency we set a limit on the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}< 0.731\\times10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with the confidence level set at $90\\%$.

    "title": "Implementing quantum dimensionality reduction for non-Markovian  stochastic simulation",
    "abstract": "Complex systems are embedded in our everyday experience. Stochastic modelling enables us to understand and predict the behaviour of such systems, cementing its utility across the quantitative sciences. Accurate models of highly non-Markovian processes -- where the future behaviour depends on events that happened far in the past -- must track copious amounts of information about past observations, requiring high-dimensional memories. Quantum technologies can ameliorate this cost, allowing models of the same processes with lower memory dimension than corresponding classical models. Here we implement such memory-efficient quantum models for a family of non-Markovian processes using a photonic setup. We show that with a single qubit of memory our implemented quantum models can attain higher precision than possible with any classical model of the same memory dimension. This heralds a key step towards applying quantum technologies in complex systems modelling. ",
