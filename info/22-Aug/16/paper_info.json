    "abstract": "Quantum states of light and matter can be manipulated on the nanoscale to provide a technological resource for aiding the implementation of scalable photonic quantum technologies [1-3]. Experimental progress relies on the quality and efficiency of the coupling between photons and internal states of quantum emitters [4-6]. Here we demonstrate a nanophotonic waveguide platform with embedded quantum dots (QDs) that enables both Purcell-enhanced emission and strong chiral coupling. The design uses slow-light effects in a glide-plane photonic crystal waveguide with QD tuning to match the emission frequency to the slow-light region. Simulations were used to map the chirality and Purcell enhancement depending on the position of a dipole emitter relative to the air holes. The highest Purcell factors and chirality occur in separate regions, but there is still a significant area where high values of both can be obtained. Based on this, we first demonstrate a record large radiative decay rate of 17 ns^-1 (60 ps lifetime) corresponding to a 20 fold Purcell enhancement. This was achieved by electric-field tuning of the QD to the slow-light region and quasi-resonant phonon-sideband excitation. We then demonstrate a 5 fold Purcell enhancement for a dot with high degree of chiral coupling to waveguide modes, substantially surpassing all previous measurements. Together these demonstrate the excellent prospects for using QDs in scalable implementations of on-chip spin-photonics relying on chiral quantum optics. ",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in filling the gap of miniaturized terahertz/mid-infrared radiation sources and, particularly, in incorporating these sources into micro/nanophotonic circuits. By using rigorous electromagnetic methods, we investigate the lasing conditions and the electric-tunability of radiative and non radiative propagating surface-plasmon modes in cylinders made of active materials coated with a graphene layer. A detailed analysis of the lasing condition of different surface-plasmon modes shows that there is an abrupt change in the gain required when modes become nonradiative. Although radiative modes, subject to both radiation and ohmic losses, are expected to require more gain compensation than nonradiative modes, we find that, counterintuitively, gain compensation is greater for nonradiative modes. This is explained in terms of a change in the distribution of fields that occurs when the character of modes switches from plasmonic to photonic. Finally, we assess the feasibility of our proposal by using a realist gain medium and showing that a relatively low population inversion is required for the stimulated emission of the studied system.

The partial reflecting surface (PRS) is elaborately tailored to serve as both a component of the FP antenna and the metal ground of the broadband liquid absorber. Then the integrated structure is realized by combining the FP antenna with the liquid absorber. The PRS is composed of patches on the top layer of the substrate and the square loop on the bottom and the microstrip patch antenna is used as a source. The liquid absorber is composed of a 3-D printed container, 45% ethanol layer, and a metal ground. By this design, the structure can serve as the FP antenna when the ethanol is extracted or the liquid absorber when the ethanol is injected. This can be used to switch between detection and stealth mode which can better adapt to the complex electromagnetic environment. The simulation results show that the gain of the antenna reaches to 19.7 dBi and the operating band is 100 MHz when the ethanol is extracted. When the ethanol is injected, the absorption band of the absorber ranges from 4 GHz to 20 GHz and the absorption bandwidth is over 133%. The monostatic RCS reduction bands of the structure with ethanol range from 4 GHz to 20GHz and the average RCS reduction is 28.4 dB. The measured and simulated results agree well. ",

Optical systems operating on the principles of excitation of extremely high-quality factor trapped modes (also known as the bound states in the continuum, BICs) are of great interest since they allow the implementation of laser and sensor devices with outstanding characteristics. In this paper, we discuss how one can utilize the natural anisotropy of novel materials, particularly, the bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) composite, to realize the excitation of trapped modes in dielectric metasurfaces. The bulk MoS2 composite is a finely-stratified structure characterized by averaged constitutive parameters possessing a form birefringence property. Our metasurface is composed of an array of disk-shaped nanoparticles (resonators) made of the MoS2 composite under the assumption that the anisotropy axis of the MoS2 composite can be tilted to the rotation axis of the disks. We perform a detailed analysis of eigenwaves and scattering properties of such anisotropic resonators as well as the spectral features of the metasurface revealing dependence of the excitation conditions of the trapped mode on the anisotropy axis orientation of the MoS2 composite used.

The filaments are characterized by high optical intensity, reduced (even zero) angular spreading and can contain laser plasma or be plasmaless (postfilaments). The presence of optical turbulence on the propagation path dramatically changes pulse filamentation dynamics and in some cases causes pulse fragmentation enhancement and collapse arrest. For the first time to our knowledge, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the transverse profile of Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser radiation nonlinearly propagating a 65 m air path to the region of postfilament evolution after passing through an artificial localized air turbulence. We show that when a turbulent layer is placed before the filamentation region, the average number of high-intensive local fluence maxima (\"hot points\") in pulse profile as well as their sizes grow as the turbulence strength increases, and then saturates at some levels. On the contrary, the deposition of a turbulent screen within the filamentation region has almost no effect on both the number and the average diameter of the postfilaments. ",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable attention for their broad impacts on various physical platforms and peculiar applications. In non-Hermitian systems, both eigenvalues and eigenstates simultaneously coalesce at exceptional points (EPs). As one of the remarkable features of EPs, the field chirality is commonly considered perfect, which is utilized as an intriguing feature to control wave propagation and regarded as a criterion of EP. However, in this work, we discover an imperfect chirality of eigenmodes at the EPs in an optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavity perturbed by two strong nanoscatterers. This counterintuitive phenomenon originates from a strong frequency-dependence of the scattering between the counterpropagating waves at an \"effective scatterer\", which could be explained by a first-principle-based model considering a dynamic multiple-scattering process of the azimuthally propagating modes. We find that the generally imperfect chirality at the EP tends to be globally perfect with the decrease of the scattering effect induced by the nanoscatterers. Furthermore, the chirality also becomes locally perfect with the decrease of the relative azimuthal angle between the two strong nanoscatterers. This work provides a new understanding of the general properties of chirality at EPs. It will benefit the potential applications enabled by the chirality features of non-Hermitian systems at EPs. ",

Supported by a mathematical formulation, we find that the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the cavity resonances exhibits a square root dependence on the refractive index (RI) change in one of the subcavities. The proposed fiber cavity refractive index sensor has a maximum sensitivity of $2.26\\times10^7$ GHz/RIU and a lowest detection limit of $10^{-9}$ RIU, widely outperforming the comparable cavity sensors subject to the same refractive index change, gain, and loss settings.

The synthesis of such materials and experimental observation of their physics remain very challenging. In this work, we extend the concept of photonic time crystals to metasurfaces.

Moreover, in sharp contrast to bulk time-crystals, the momentum bandgap can be directly accessed by free-space excitations, significantly simplifying the crystal implementation and its exploitation. Based on a microwave metasurface design, we achieved the first experimental confirmation of exponential wave amplification inside a momentum bandgap. The proposed metasurface serves as a universal material platform for realizing exotic photonic space-time crystals and providing low-noise amplification for surface wave signals in future 6G wireless communications.

    "abstract": "Time-reflection is a uniform inversion of the temporal evolution of a signal, which arises when an abrupt change in the properties of the host material occurs uniformly in space. At such a time-interface, a portion of the input signal is time-reversed, and its frequency spectrum is homogeneously translated while its momentum is conserved, forming the temporal counterpart of a spatial interface. Combinations of time-interfaces, forming time-metamaterials and Floquet matter, exploit the interference among multiple time-reflections for extreme wave manipulation, leveraging time as a new degree of freedom. Here, we report the observation of photonic time-reflections and associated broadband frequency translations in a switched transmission-line metamaterial whose effective capacitance is homogeneously and abruptly changed via a synchronized array of switches. A pair of temporal interfaces are combined to demonstrate time-reflection-induced wave interference, realizing the temporal counterpart of a Fabry-Perot cavity. Our results establish foundational building blocks to realize time-metamaterials and Floquet photonic crystals, with opportunities for extreme photon manipulation in space and time. ",

OAM modes with both azimuthal and radial indices are created using phase-only transmission plates. The beams undergo terahertz to optical conversion in an atomic vapour, before being imaged in the far field using an optical CCD camera. In addition to the spatial intensity profile, we also observe the self-interferogram of the beams by imaging through a tilted lens, allowing the sign and magnitude of the azimuthal index to be read out directly. Using this technique, we can reliably read out the OAM mode of low-intensity beams with high fidelity in 10 ms. Such a demonstration is expected to have far-reaching consequences for proposed applications of terahertz OAM beams in communications and microscopy. ",

Degree of polarization (DOP), a classical property of propagating light, is shown to be preserved when passed through experimentally generated turbulence.

Due to this resistance to turbulence, which does not require adaptive optics or post processing, we suggest that DOP could pose a valuable degree-of-freedom for multiplexed FSO communication and basis dependent encryption schemes.

In separate works, such devices have achieved strong coupling to both superconducting qubits, via piezoelectricity, and optical cavities, via Brillouin interactions. In this work, we present a novel hybrid microwave/optical platform capable of coupling to bulk acoustic waves through cavity-enhanced piezoelectric and photoelastic interactions. The modular, tunable system achieves fully resonant and well-mode-matched interactions between a 3D microwave cavity, a high-frequency bulk acoustic resonator, and a Fabry Perot cavity. We realize this piezo-Brillouin interaction in x-cut quartz, demonstrating the potential for strong optomechanical interactions and high cooperativity using optical cavity enhancement. We further show how this device functions as a bidirectional electro-opto-mechanical transducer, with quantum efficiency exceeding $10^{-8}$, and a feasible path towards unity conversion efficiency. The high optical sensitivity and ability to apply large resonant microwave field in this system also offers a new tool for probing anomalous electromechanical couplings, which we demonstrate by investigating (nominally-centrosymmetric) CaF$_2$ and revealing a parasitic piezoelectricity of 83 am/V. Such studies are an important topic for emerging quantum technologies, and highlight the versatility of this new hybrid platform. ",

It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints. Dark photon dark matter in the 0.1-1 meV mass range (20-200 GHz) could likely be detected at a similar sensitivity in an apparatus designed for dark photon detection. ",

    "abstract": "Reducing the number of measurements required to estimate the expectation value of an observable is crucial for the variational quantum eigensolver to become competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms. To measure complicated observables such as a molecular electronic Hamiltonian, one of the common strategies is to partition the observable into linear combinations (fragments) of mutually commutative Pauli products. The total number of measurements for obtaining the expectation value is then proportional to the sum of variances of individual fragments. We propose a method that lowers individual fragment variances by modifying the fragments without changing the total observable expectation value. Our approach is based on adding Pauli products (\"ghosts\") that are compatible with members of multiple fragments. The total expectation value does not change because a sum of coefficients for each \"ghost\" Pauli product introduced to several fragments is zero. Yet, these additions change individual fragment variances because of the non-vanishing contributions of \"ghost\" Pauli products within each fragment. The proposed algorithm minimizes individual fragment variances using a classically efficient approximation of the quantum wavefunction for variance estimations. Numerical tests on a few molecular electronic Hamiltonian expectation values show several-fold reductions in the number of measurements in the \"ghost\" Pauli algorithm compared to those in the other recently developed techniques.

However, work-to-date has assumed idealized components, including a perfect $\\pi$ Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the limitations of realistic quantum photonic neural networks that suffer from fabrication imperfections leading to photon loss and imperfect routing, and weak nonlinearities, showing that they can learn to overcome most of these errors. Using the example of a Bell-state analyzer, we demonstrate that there is an optimal network size, which balances imperfections versus the ability to compensate for lacking nonlinearities. With a sub-optimal $\\pi/10$ effective Kerr nonlinearity, we show that a network fabricated with current state-of-the-art processes can achieve an unconditional fidelity of 0.891, that increases to 0.999999 if it is possible to precondition success on the detection of a photon in each logical photonic qubit.

Modulation of many individual optical beams is central to the application of arbitrary gate and control sequences on arrays of atoms or atom-like systems. At telecom wavelengths, miniaturization of optical components via photonic integration has pushed the scale and performance of classical and quantum optics far beyond the limitations of bulk devices. However, these material platforms for high-speed telecom integrated photonics are not transparent at the short wavelengths required by leading atomic systems. Here, we propose and implement a scalable and reconfigurable photonic architecture for multi-channel quantum control using integrated, visible-light modulators based on thin-film lithium niobate. Our approach combines techniques in free-space optics, holography, and control theory together with a sixteen-channel integrated photonic device to stabilize temporal and cross-channel power deviations and enable precise and uniform control. Applying this device to a homogeneous constellation of silicon-vacancy artificial atoms in diamond, we present techniques to spatially and spectrally address a dynamically-selectable set of these stochastically-positioned point emitters. We anticipate that this scalable and reconfigurable optical architecture will lead to systems that could enable parallel individual programmability of large many-body atomic systems, which is a critical step towards universal quantum computation on such hardware.

    "abstract": "Aerodynamics plays an important role in aviation industry and aircraft design. Detecting and minimizing the phenomenon of flow separation from scattered pressure data on airfoil is critical for ensuring stable and efficient aviation. However, since it is challenging to understand the mechanics of flow field separation, the aerodynamic parameters are emphasized for the identification and control of flow separation. It has been investigated extensively using traditional algorithms and machine learning methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) models. Recently, a growing interest in quantum computing and its applications among wide research communities sheds light upon the use of quantum techniques to solve aerodynamic problems. In this paper, we apply qSVM, a quantum SVM algorithm based on the quantum annealing model, to identify whether there is flow separation, with their performance in comparison to the widely-used classical SVM. We show that our approach outperforms the classical SVM with an 11.1% increase of the accuracy, from 0.818 to 0.909, for this binary classification task. We further develop multi-class qSVMs based on one-against-all algorithm. We apply it to classify multiple types of the attack angles to the wings, where the advantage over the classical multi-class counterpart is maintained with an accuracy increased from 0.67 to 0.79, by 17.9%. Our work demonstrates a useful quantum technique for classifying flow separation scenarios, and may promote rich investigations for quantum computing applications in fluid dynamics. ",

The first is a sign-problem-free Hubbard--Holstein model of local electron-phonon interactions, where we show that with care to control for population bias via importance sampling and/or reweighting, the method can achieve unbiased energies extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, without suffering additional computational overheads from relaxing boson occupation constraints. Secondly, we apply the method as a `solver' within a quantum embedding scheme which maps electronic systems to local electron-boson auxiliary models, with the bosons representing coupling to long-range plasmonic-like fluctuations. We are able to sample these general electron-boson hamiltonians with ease despite a formal sign problem, including a faithful reconstruction of converged reduced density matrices of the system. ",
