    "abstract": "A physics package for a compact cold atomic clock is hereby presented. The uniqueness of this package is its small dimensions that enable, for the first time, implementation of a primary cold atomic clock in a standard package of 3U height (=133mm). These dimensions are made possible by using an in-vacuum Microwave (MW) Loop Gap Resonator (LGR) whose length and diameter can be reduced from those of a typical resonator. Following our presentation of the design, we analyze the homogeneity of the MW field amplitude and phase. We find that the expected clock instability due to non-uniformity of the MW field is $\\sim1.5\\cdot10^{-14}$/day. Adding other clock errors, we estimate the total uncertainty of a cold atomic clock of this design will be around $\\sim2\\cdot10^{-14}$/day which results in a time drift of a few nanoseconds/day. Such a clock can serve as a primary-grade frequency reference, and may replace the cesium beam atomic clock and the GPS-disciplined rubidium atomic clocks. ",

    "abstract": "Optical singularities play a major role in modern optics and are frequently deployed in structured light, super-resolution microscopy, and holography. While phase singularities are uniquely defined as locations of undefined phase, polarization singularities studied thus far are either partial, i.e., bright points of well-defined polarization, or unstable for small field perturbations. We demonstrate for the first time a complete, topologically protected polarization singularity; it is located in the 4D space spanned by the three spatial dimensions and the wavelength and is created in the focus of a cascaded metasurface-lens system. The field Jacobian plays a key role in the design of such higher-dimensional singularities, which can be extended to multidimensional wave phenomena, and pave the way to novel applications in topological photonics and precision sensing.

    "abstract": "A photonics-enabled wavelet-like transform system, characterized by multi-resolution time-frequency analysis, is proposed based on a typical stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pump-probe setup using an optical nonlinear frequency-sweep signal. In the pump path, a continuous-wave optical signal is injected into an SBS medium to generate an SBS gain. In the probe path, a periodic nonlinear frequency-sweep optical signal with a time-varying chirp rate is generated, which is then modulated at a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) by the electrical signal under test (SUT). The optical signal from the MZM is selectively amplified by the SBS gain and converted back to the electrical domain using a low-speed photodetector, implementing the periodic SBS-based frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM). The frequency-domain information corresponding to different periods is mapped to the time domain via the FTTM in the form of low-speed electrical pulses, which is then spliced to analyze the time-frequency relationship of the SUT in real-time. The time-varying chirp rate in each sweep period makes the signals with different frequencies have different frequency resolutions in the FTTM process, which is very similar to the characteristics of the wavelet transform, so we call it wavelet-like transform. An experiment is carried out. Multi-resolution time-frequency analysis of a variety of RF signals is carried out in a 4-GHz bandwidth limited only by the equipment. ",

    "abstract": "In the presence of crystalline symmetries, second-order topological insulators can be featured by the polarization which is believed identical to the Wannier center. In this Letter, we show that second-order topological insulators are present in the full process of topological phase transition between a pair of degenerate photonic bands resulting from the non-symmorphic glide symmetry in all-dielectric photonic crystals. Due to the coupling (hybridization) of the Wannier functions, the center of the maximally localized Wannier function always locates at the origin, not equal to the addition of constituent polarization. In this case, the corner states are ascribed to the hybridized Wannier functions obstructed by the boundary. In combination with the local density of states, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. That ensures corner states which are fundamentally different to either the type-I corner state localized in particular sublattice, or the type-II corner state originated from interacting topological edge states. This type of corner states is regarded as type-III here and provides an alternative method to explore higher-order topological physics, which may lead to interesting applications in integrated and quantum photonics.

Nonlinear optical isolators have attracted great attention because of their significance in fundamental science and their important advantages in integrated photonic circuits. However, optical isolators based on Kerr or Kerr-like nonlinearity are subject to dynamical reciprocity when the forward and backward signals enter nonlinear systems simultaneously. Here, we theoretically propose and numerically prove an on-chip nonlinear isolator with dynamic nonreciprocity. Dynamic nonreciprocity is achieved via the chiral modulation of resonance frequency due to self- and cross-Kerr nonlinearity in an optical resonator. This work of dynamic nonreciprocity with a Kerr nonlinear resonator is an essential step toward integrated optical isolators. ",

    "abstract": "Under the introduction of any interface in its trajectory, an optical beam experiences polarization-dependent deflections in the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the plane of incidence. The physics of such optical beam shifts is connected to profound universal wave phenomena governed by the fine interference effects of wave packets and has opened up avenues towards metrological applications. Here, we reveal the inherent non-separability of the longitudinal and transverse beam shifts by considering a rather simple case of a partially reflecting Gaussian laser beam from a dielectric interface. This non-separability appears substantially in some particular regions in the corresponding parameter space. We further show that such non-separability manifests as a position-position classically entangled state of light. The tunability of the related experimental parameters offers control over the degree of entanglement. Uncovering of the inherent non-separability of the two types of beam shifts is expected to enrich the physical origin of this fundamental effect, impact the understanding of numerous analogous effects, and might find useful applications by exploiting the position-position-polarization classical entanglement in a fundamental Gaussian beam.

    "abstract": "High precision interferometers such as gravitational-wave detectors require complex seismic isolation systems in order to decouple the experiment from unwanted ground motion. Improved inertial sensors for active isolation potentially enhance the sensitivity of existing and future gravitational-wave detectors, especially below 30 Hz, and thereby increase the range of detectable astrophysical signals. This paper presents a vertical inertial sensor which senses the relative motion between an inertial test mass suspended by a blade spring and a seismically isolated platform. An interferometric readout was used which introduces low sensing noise, and preserves a large dynamic range due to fringe-counting. The expected sensitivity is comparable to other state-of-the-art interferometric inertial sensors and reaches values of $10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 100 mHz and $10^{-12}\\,\\text{m}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz. The potential sensitivity improvement compared to commercial L-4C geophones is shown to be about two orders of magnitude at 10 mHz and 100 mHz and one order of magnitude at 1 Hz. The noise performance is expected to be limited by thermal noise of the inertial test mass suspension below 10 Hz. Further performance limitations of the sensor, such as tilt-to-vertical coupling from a non-perfect levelling of the test mass and nonlinearities in the interferometric readout, are also quantified and discussed.

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models use an ever-increasing number of parameters to train (175 billion parameters for GPT-3) with large datasets to obtain better performance. Bigger is better has been the norm. Optical computing has been reawakened as a potential solution to large-scale computing through optical accelerators that carry out linear operations while reducing electrical power. However, to achieve efficient computing with light, creating and controlling nonlinearity optically rather than electronically remains a challenge. This study explores a reservoir computing (RC) approach whereby a 14 mm long few-mode waveguide in LiNbO3 on insulator is used as a complex nonlinear optical processor. A dataset is encoded digitally on the spectrum of a femtosecond pulse which is then launched in the waveguide. The output spectrum depends nonlinearly on the input. We experimentally show that a simple digital linear classifier with 784 parameters using the output spectrum from the waveguide as input increased the classification accuracy of several databases compared to non-transformed data, approximately 10$\\%$. In comparison, a deep digital neural network (NN) with 40000 parameters was necessary to achieve the same accuracy. Reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $\\sim$50 illustrates that a compact optical RC approach can perform on par with a deep digital NN. ",

Comprehensive chemical, spectroscopic and microscopic characterization confirms the growth of ordered nanosheets-like hexagonal BN (h-BN).

Our work unveils an important step that brings a plethora of applications ranging from the precise design of photonic devices, quantum information technology, transparent lubricant coatings, chemically inert capping layers for corrosive and ambient-air degradable materials, and 2D flexible nano-electronics, thus creating a scenario for h-BN on demand at frugal thermal budget.

To satisfy its requirement for twin-field coherence, all present setups adopted essentially a gigantic, resource-inefficient interferometer structure that lacks scalability that mature QKD systems provide with simplex quantum links. Here we introduce a novel technique that can stabilise an open channel without using a closed interferometer and has general applicability to phase-sensitive quantum communications. Using locally generated frequency combs to establish mutual coherence, we develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre and can operate over links of 100 km asymmetry.

Typically, these models are abstractions that do not find unambiguous physical realisations in nature. Here, we realise an all-to-all interacting, disordered spin system by subjecting an atomic cloud in a cavity to a controllable light shift. Adjusting the detuning between atom resonance and cavity mode, we can tune between disordered versions of a central-mode model and a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. By spectroscopically probing the low-energy excitations of the system, we explore the competition of interactions with disorder across a broad parameter range. We show how disorder in the central-mode model breaks the strong collective coupling, making the dark state manifold cross over to a random distribution of weakly-mixed light-matter, \"grey\", states. In the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model the ferromagnetic finite-size ground state evolves towards a paramagnet as disorder is increased. In that regime, semi-localised eigenstates emerge, as we observe by extracting bounds on the participation ratio. These results present significant steps towards freely programmable cavity-mediated interactions for the design of arbitrary spin Hamiltonians. ",
