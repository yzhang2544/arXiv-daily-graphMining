Here we describe the architecture and fully characterize a telecom-band, self-modelocking frequency comb based on a free-space laser with an Er/Yb co-doped glass gain medium. The laser provides a robust and cost-effective alternative to Er:fiber laser based frequency combs, while offering stability and noise performance similar to Ti:sapphire laser systems. Finally, we demonstrate the Er/Yb:glass frequency comb's utility in high-stability frequency synthesis using two ultra-stable optical references at 1157 nm and 1070 nm and in low-noise photonic microwave generation by dividing these references to the microwave domain.

    "abstract": "Twisted light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been extensively studied for applications in quantum and classical communications, microscopy, and optical micromanipulation. Ejecting the naturally high angular momentum whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of an optical microresonator through a grating-assisted mechanism, where the generated OAM number ($l$) is the difference of the angular momentum of the WGM and that of the grating, provides a scalable, chip-integrated solution for OAM generation. However, demonstrated OAM microresonators have exhibited a much lower quality factor ($Q$) than conventional WGM resonators (by $>100\\times$), and an understanding of the ultimate limits on $Q$ has been lacking. This is crucial given the importance of $Q$ in enhancing light-matter interactions, such as single emitter coupling and parametric nonlinear processes, that underpin many important microresonator applications. Moreover, though high-OAM states are often desirable, the limits on what is achievable in a microresonator configuration are not well understood. Here, we provide new physical insight on these two longstanding questions, through understanding OAM from the perspective of mode coupling in a photonic crystal ring, and linking it to the commonly studied case of coherent backscattering between counter-propagating WGMs. In addition to demonstrating high-$Q$ ($10^5$ to $10^6$), high estimated OAM ejection efficiency (up to $90~\\%$), and high-OAM number (up to $l$ = 60), our empirical model is supported by experiments and provides a quantitative explanation for the behavior of $Q$ and OAM ejection efficiency with $l$ for the first time. The state-of-the-art performance and new understanding of the physics of microresonator OAM generation will open new opportunities for realizing OAM applications using chip-integrated technologies.

However, because the only thing we can measure is the amplitude of the complex field on the real axis, it is difficult to identify how the complex field behaves throughout the complex plane. In this study, we interpreted quantitative phase imaging methods via the Hilbert transform in terms of analytic continuation, manifesting the behavior in the whole complex plane. Using Rouche's theorem, we proved the imaging conditions imposed by Kramers-Kronig holographic imaging. The deviation from the Kramers-Kronig holography conditions was examined using computational images and experimental data. We believe that this study provides a clue for holographic imaging using the holomorphic characteristics of a complex optical field. ",

Here, we employ this principle to shift the center frequency of high power femtosecond laser pulses over a range of several THz with the help of a nonlinear multi-pass cell.

Furthermore, we experimentally show that this wavelength shifting technique supports coherence characteristics at the few Hz-level while improving the temporal pulse quality.

Our results show that PtSe2 is an ultrathin and scalable semimetal that concurrently possesses high index and high extinction across the vis-NIR range. Consequently, the thin-film PtSe2 on a reflector separated by a dielectric spacer can absorb > 85 % for the unpatterned case and ~97 % for the optimized 2D metasurface in the 400-900 nm range making it one of the strongest and thinnest broadband perfect absorbers to date.

In particular, $VO_2$ has been sandwiched between: i) two photonic crystals made of $SiO_2$ and $ZrO_2$; ii) two aperiodic structures made of $SiO_2$ and $ZrO_2$ that follow the Thue-Morse sequence; iii) two disordered photonic structures, made of $SiO_2$ and $ZrO_2$ in which the disorder is introduced either by a random sequence of the two materials or by a random variation of the thicknesses of the layers; iv) two four material-based photonic crystals made of $SiO_2$, $Al_2O_3$, $Y_2O_3$, and $ZrO_2$. The ordered structures i and iv show, respectively, one and two intense transmission valleys with defect modes, while the aperiodic and disordered structures ii and iii show a manifold of transmission valleys due to their complex layered configurations.

We specifically note two key themes of importance to educators: (1) when reasoning about computational power, students often struggled to distinguish between the relative effects of exponential and linear scaling, resulting in students frequently focusing on distinctions that are arguably better understood as analog-digital than classical-quantum, and (2) introducing the thought experiment of analog classical computers was a powerful tool for helping students develop a more expertlike perspective on the differences between classical and quantum computers.

    "abstract": "We present a simple idea to generate two new types of integrable multi-L\\'evy-index and mix-L\\'evy-index (mixed) fractional nonlinear soliton hierarchies, containing multi-index and mixed fractional higher-order nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) hierarchy, fractional complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (cmKdV) hierarchy, and fractional mKdV hierarchy. Their explicit forms can be given using the completeness of squared eigenfunctions. Moreover, we present their anomalous dispersive relations via their linearizations, and fractional multi-soliton solutions via the inverse scattering transform with matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems. These obtained fractional multi-soliton solutions may be useful to understand the related super-dispersion transports of nonlinear waves in multi-index fractional nonlinear media. ",

    "abstract": "We report the effects of passivation on the various properties like electronic structure, structural stability and optical properties of CdTe in the different nanostructure forms such as ultra-thin slabs, monolayers, nanorods and nanotubes. Further, based on these properties, the self-healing ability of each nanostructure has been predicted. The optical properties suggest that all of the passivated and specific unpassivated nanostructures are suitable for optoelectronic applications. The 2D system in <110> orientation and nanotube derived from the <111> monolayer show significant self-healing in the pristine structures. ",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning applications require huge artificial networks demanding in computational power and memory. Light-based platforms promise ultra-fast and energy-efficient hardware, which may help in realizing next-generation data processing devices. However, current photonic networks are limited by the number of input-output nodes that can be processed in a single shot. This restricted network capacity prevents their application to relevant large-scale problems such as natural language processing. Here, we realize a photonic processor with a capacity exceeding $1.5 \\times 10^{10}$ optical nodes, more than one order of magnitude larger than any previous implementation, which enables photonic large-scale text encoding and classification. By exploiting the full three-dimensional structure of the optical field propagating in free space, we overcome the interpolation threshold and reach the over-parametrized region of machine learning, a condition that allows high-performance natural language processing with a minimal fraction of training points. Our results provide a novel solution to scale-up light-driven computing and open the route to photonic language processing. ",

    "abstract": "The IR response of a backside illuminated type Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) transition-edge bolometer (TEB) in a free-membrane configuration is measured and analyzed. The analysis is based on a comprehensive equivalent circuit model for the bolometer structure considering all the thermal parameters of the device. The detector is made using a 450nm superconductive YBCO thin film grown on about 100 um thick crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) substrate using an optimized low cost Metal Organic Deposition (MOD) technique. The backside illuminated structure provided a basis for freely utilizing different IR absorber materials and structures on the backside of the bolometer in order to get wide band high radiation absorption coefficient for the device, while also avoiding any negative effect of the deposition of the absorber layer on the YBCO thin film properties. The obtained analytical and experimental results for the backside illuminated bolometer were also compared with the results of the previously reported front-side illuminated bolometers. ",
