    "title": "Image sensing with multilayer, nonlinear optical neural networks",
    "abstract": "Optical imaging is commonly used for both scientific and technological applications across industry and academia. In image sensing, a measurement, such as of an object's position, is performed by computational analysis of a digitized image. An emerging image-sensing paradigm breaks this delineation between data collection and analysis by designing optical components to perform not imaging, but encoding. By optically encoding images into a compressed, low-dimensional latent space suitable for efficient post-analysis, these image sensors can operate with fewer pixels and fewer photons, allowing higher-throughput, lower-latency operation. Optical neural networks (ONNs) offer a platform for processing data in the analog, optical domain. ONN-based sensors have however been limited to linear processing, but nonlinearity is a prerequisite for depth, and multilayer NNs significantly outperform shallow NNs on many tasks. Here, we realize a multilayer ONN pre-processor for image sensing, using a commercial image intensifier as a parallel optoelectronic, optical-to-optical nonlinear activation function. We demonstrate that the nonlinear ONN pre-processor can achieve compression ratios of up to 800:1 while still enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision tasks, including machine-vision benchmarks, flow-cytometry image classification, and identification of objects in real scenes. In all cases we find that the ONN's nonlinearity and depth allowed it to outperform a purely linear ONN encoder. Although our experiments are specialized to ONN sensors for incoherent-light images, alternative ONN platforms should facilitate a range of ONN sensors. These ONN sensors may surpass conventional sensors by pre-processing optical information in spatial, temporal, and/or spectral dimensions, potentially with coherent and quantum qualities, all natively in the optical domain.

While the scale and complexity of programmable PICs is increasing, the characterization, and thus calibration, of them becomes increasingly challenging. Here we demonstrate a phase retrieval method for programmable PICs using an on-chip fractional-delay reference path. The impulse response of the chip can be uniquely and precisely identified from only the insertion loss using a standard complex Fourier transform. We demonstrate our approach experimentally with a 4-tap finite-impulse-response chip. The results match well with expectations and verifies our approach as effective for individually determining the taps' weights without the need for additional ports and photodiodes. ",

    "abstract": "High efficiency and a compact footprint are desired properties for electro-optic modulators. In this paper, we propose, theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate a recirculating phase modulator, which increases the modulation efficiency by modulating the optical field several times in a non-resonant waveguide structure. The 'recycling' of light is achieved by looping the optical path that exits the phase modulator back and coupling it to a higher order waveguide mode, which then repeats its passage through the phase modulator. By looping the light back twice, we were able to demonstrate a recirculating phase modulator that requires nine times lower power to generate the same modulation index of a single pass phase modulator. This approach of modulation efficiency enhancement is promising for the design of advanced tunable electro optical frequency comb generators and other electro-optical devices with defined operational frequency bandwidths.

    "abstract": "The reflectionless coherent light transport in the coupled resonator array is investigated in the presence of intra-resonator intermodal coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise modes, which plays a constructive role for modulating the light flow rather than inducing the unwanted backscattering. The interplay between the intra-resonator intermodal coupling and the inter-resonator couplings enables the coherent resonant transmission (CRT) of the properly superposed injection constituted by the clockwise and counterclockwise modes. The superposition coefficients of the initial excitation determine the mode chirality of the resonant transmission. Sequentially experiencing the time-reversal process of CRT and the CRT realizes the perfect mode conversion that the mode chirality of the injection wave switches into the opposite after resonant transmission. Our findings on the coherent light transport provide insights for the control and manipulation of light field in the integrated photonics, nanophotonics, chiral optics, and beyond. ",

    "abstract": "A blood vessel can be considered as a microfluidic system where the red blood cells (RBCs) are floating inside it. While an ultrasound wave is stablished, all microparticles are enforced by acoustophoretic forces. In this contribution, the acoustic radiation force and torque applied to each particle in one and two-particle systems including spheres and also RBCs are studied. The surrounding fluid in microfluidic devices is often water, while in our study is viscous and then viscoelastic fluid. In one-particle systems, we obtain that the radiation force on a sphere is greater than on an RBC of the same size. Furthermore, for both viscous and viscoelastic fluids the force increases (decreases) by fluid's viscosity (relaxation time). In two-particle systems, the total radiation force applied to each particle consists of primary and interaction forces. The acoustic interaction forces between two spheres and also two RBCs in viscous fluids with various viscosities are examined. The force is a decreasing exponential function of the inter-particle distance. In the following, for a definite inter-particle distance, we obtain the functionality of the force between two RBCs in terms of viscosity and angle of rotation in a viscous fluid. The obtained equaton indicates that the acoustic interaction force decreases linearly by the rotation angle. Then, the interaction force in viscoelastic fluids is obtained as a function of interparticle distance, rotation angle and rheological parameters such as viscosity and relaxation time. Our findings represent that the force is a power-law function of interparticle distance and an exponential function of rotation angle. Finally, the acoustic interaction torque on each RBC in viscous and viscoelastic fluids is obtained as a sinusoidal function of rotation angle. ",

However, the rapidly growing number of experimental studies has so far not been supported by a systematic theory of the electronic, thermal and optical response of these materials. Here, we use the techniques previously derived in the context of noble metals to go beyond a simple electromagnetic modelling of low electron density Drude materials and provide an electron dynamics model for their electronic and thermal response. We find that the low electron density makes momentum conservation in electron-phonon interactions more important, more complex and more sensitive to the temperatures compared with noble metals; moreover, we find that electron-electron interactions are becoming more effective due to the weaker screening. Most importantly, we show that the low electron density makes the electron heat capacity much smaller than in noble metals, such that the electrons in LEDD materials tend to heat up much more and cool down faster compared to noble metals. While here we focus on indium tin oxide (ITO), our analytic results can be easily applied to any LEDD materials. ",

Two variants exist: the VB-VMC (using variational Monte Carlo) and VB-DMC (using diffusion Monte Carlo) methods. QMC algorithms circumvent the notorious non-orthogonality issue of classical VB approaches, and allow highly efficient calculations on massively parallel machines. Calculation of VB weights and resonance energies are possible at the VB-VMC level, which makes VB-VMC a correlated method retaining all the interpretative capabilities of classical VB methods. Several recent applications are shown to illustrate the potential of this method as a modern alternative to classical VB methods to study ground and excited states of molecules. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a method of enhancing NMR signals via the transfer of polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins using on-resonance microwave (MW) irradiation. In most cases, monochromatic continuous-wave (MCW) MW irradiation is used. Recently, several groups have shown that the use of frequency modulation of the MW irradiation can result in an additional increase in DNP enhancement above that obtained with MCW. The effect of frequency modulation on the solid effect (SE) and the cross effect (CE) has previously been studied using the stable organic radical 4-hydroxy TEMPO (TEMPOL) at temperatures under 20 K. Here, in addition to the SE and CE, we discuss the effect of frequency modulation on the Overhauser effect (OE) and the truncated CE (tCE) in the room-temperature $^{13}$C-DNP of diamond powders. We recently showed that diamond powders can exhibit multiple DNP mechanisms simultaneously due to the heterogeneity of P1 (substitutional nitrogen) environments within diamond crystallites. We explore the enhancement obtained via the two most important parameters for frequency modulation 1) Modulation frequency, $f_{m}$ (how fast the modulation frequency is varied) and 2) Modulation amplitude, $\\Delta\\omega$ (the magnitude of the change in microwave frequency) influence the enhancement obtained via each mechanism. Frequency modulation during DNP not only allows us to improve DNP enhancement, but also gives us a way to control which DNP mechanism is most active. By choosing the appropriate modulation parameters, we can selectively enhance some mechanisms while simultaneously suppressing others. ",

However, using this technique for positron acceleration is still challenging because positively charged particles are naturally defocused in nonlinear wakefields. Here we propose and numerically demonstrate a scheme to accelerate an externally injected positron beam in a nonlinear laser wakefield in a regime where a tail wave is formed behind density cusps of the wakefield. This tail wave can provide a focusing force in addition to longitudinal acceleration for the positrons. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that a trapping efficiency of positrons of nearly 100% in the nonlinear wakefield is possible. This scheme may open a simple way for compact positron acceleration to multi-100 MeV with terawatt-class laser systems at high repetition rates without the need for special laser modes and plasma structures.

We introduce D-Flat, a framework in TensorFlow that renders physically-accurate images induced by metasurface optical systems. This framework is fully differentiable with respect to metasurface shape and post-capture computational parameters and allows simultaneous optimization with respect to almost any measure of sensor performance. D-Flat enables simulation of millimeter to centimeter diameter metasurfaces on commodity computers, and it is modular in the sense of accommodating a variety of wave optics models for scattering at the metasurface and for propagation to photosensors. We validate D-Flat against symbolic calculations and previous experimental measurements, and we provide simulations that demonstrate its ability to discover novel computational sensor designs for two applications: single-shot depth sensing and single-shot spatial frequency filtering.

This technique uses intra-pulse difference frequency mixing (DFM) process that can extend the second-order optical spectroscopy to the terahertz range. As a demonstration, the surface phonon of SrTiO3(001) at 2.8 THz was successfully measured. This surface polarization originates from the excess of oxygen vacancies or charge transfer at the interface.
