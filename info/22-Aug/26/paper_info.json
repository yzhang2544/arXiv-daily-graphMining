    "abstract": "This paper reports on a surface impedance measurement of a niobium titanium superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity in a magnetic field (up to $10\\,{\\rm T}$). A novel method is employed to decompose the surface resistance contributions of the cylindrical cavity end caps and walls using measurements from multiple $TM$ cavity modes. The results confirm that quality factor degradation of a NbTi SRF cavity in a high magnetic field is primarily from surfaces perpendicular to the field (the cavity end caps), while parallel surface resistances (the walls) remain relatively constant. This result is encouraging for applications needing high Q cavities in strong magnetic fields, such as the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), because it opens the possibility of hybrid SRF cavity construction to replace conventional copper cavities.

    "abstract": "An accurate treatment of the structures and dynamics that lead to enhanced chemical reactivity in enzymes requires explicit treatment of both electronic and nuclear quantum effects. The former can be captured in ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations while the latter can be included by performing ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (AI-PIMD) simulations. Both AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations have traditionally been computationally prohibitive for large enzymatic systems. Recent developments in streaming computer architectures and new algorithms to accelerate path integral simulations now make these simulations practical for biological systems, allowing elucidation of enzymatic reactions in unprecedented detail. In this chapter, we summarize these recent developments and discuss practical considerations for applying AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations to enzymes. ",

    "abstract": "The temporal degree of freedom in photonics has been a recent research hotspot due to its analogy with spatial axes, causality, and open-system characteristics. In particular, the temporal analogues of photonic crystals have stimulated the design of momentum gaps and their extension to topological and non-Hermitian photonics. Although recent studies have also revealed the effect of broken discrete time-translational symmetry in view of the temporal analogy of spatial Anderson localization, the broad intermediate regime between time order and time uncorrelated disorder has not been examined. Here we investigate the inverse design of photonic time disorder to achieve optical functionalities in spatially homogeneous platforms. By developing the structure factor and order metric using causal Green's functions for the domain of time disorder, we demonstrate engineered time scatterer, which provides unidirectional scattering with controlled scattering amplitudes. We also reveal that the order-to-disorder transition in the time domain allows for the manipulation of scattering bandwidths, which inspires resonance-free temporal colour filtering. Our work will pave the way for advancing optical functionalities without spatial patterning. ",

The proposed PGB consists of two mutually coupled fiber loops with different time delays and each loop having an acousto-optic modulator, to have a synthesized one-dimensional (1D) temporal photonic system. By controlling the gain or loss of the optical pulse recirculating in the loop and tunning the time delay difference between the two loops, arbitrary waveforms with a sampling interval equal to the time delay difference between the two fiber loops are generated. Since the time delay difference can be controlled ultra-small, the equivalent sampling rate is ultra-high. The approach is studied theoretically and evaluated experimentally. The experimental results show for an input ultra-short optical pulse with a minimum temporal width of 1.07 ps, arbitrary waveforms with a sampling rate up to 341.53 GSa/s are generated. The sampling rate can be increased to the terahertz range if the temporal width of the recirculating optical pulse is reduced to less than 1 ps. ",

However, it's still challenging to arbitrarily manipulate the degree of chirality and quantum numbers of OAM. Herein, we proposed and demonstrated OAM generations with tunable degree of chirality and large quantum numbers from microlasers. Through the design of an optical microcavity with uneven potential distribution for photons, the dissymmetry factor of OAM laser can be continuously tuned from -1 to +1 by governing the pump position. High-order vortices were also generated, in which the largest quantum number reached up to 352. We further demonstrated multi-vortex laser generation in spatial and temporal domains. This study provides a novel mechanism for manipulating the chirality of OAM based on microlasers, with a great potential in high-dimensional information processing. ",

For different parameters, the maximal detectable TCs are different, which is helpful for the measurement of TC in the practical application.

This hybrid quantum-classical method, which combines several algorithms, scales logarithmically with the dimension of the vector space and quadratically with the number of nonzero terms in the linear combination of unitary operators that specifies the linear operator describing the system of interest. As a demonstration, we apply our method to solve the advection-diffusion equation for a small system using IBM quantum computers. We find that reliable solutions of the equation can be obtained on even the noisy quantum computers available today. This and other methods that exploit quantum computers could replace some of our traditional methods in numerical weather prediction as quantum hardware continues to improve. ",

Second, knowledge of the relevance of some physical quantities is used to constrain the learnt features towards a higher physical relevance using a simple multi-task paradigm.

This solution allows us to devise the Quantum Mapping Algorithm of Resonator Interaction with $N$ Atoms (Q-MARINA), an intuitive TC mapping to a quantum circuit with linear space and time scaling, whose $N+1$ qubits represent atoms and a lossy cavity, while the dynamics is encoded through $2N$ entangling gates.

    "abstract": "Classical phase transitions, like solid-liquid-gas or order-disorder spin magnetic phases, are all driven by thermal energy fluctuations by varying the temperature. On the other hand, quantum phase transitions happen at absolute zero temperature with quantum fluctuations causing the ground state energy to show abrupt changes as one varies the system parameters like electron density, pressure, disorder, or external magnetic field. Phase transitions happen at critical values of the controlling parameters, such as the critical temperature in classical phase transitions, and system critical parameters in the quantum case. However, true criticality happens only at the thermodynamic limit, when the number of particles goes to infinity with constant density. To perform the calculations for the critical parameters, finite size scaling approach was developed to extrapolate information from a finite system to the thermodynamic limit. With the advancement in the experimental and theoretical work in the field of ultra-cold systems, particularly trapping and controlling single atomic and molecular systems, one can ask: do finite systems exhibit quantum phase transition? To address this question, finite size scaling for finite system was developed to calculate the quantum critical parameters. Recent observation of a quantum phase transition in a single trapped 171 Yb ion in the Paul trap indicates the possibility of quantum phase transition in finite systems. This perspective focuses on examining chemical processes at ultracold temperature as quantum phase transitions, particularly the formation and dissociation of chemical bonds, which is the basic process for understanding the whole of chemistry ",
