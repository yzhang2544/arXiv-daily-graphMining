    "abstract": "In this study, we designed and optimized the performance of pin junction GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction nanowire solar cell arrays. It is done by performing coupled optoelectronic simulations to find the optimal doping for the GaAs core and AlGaAs shell, and to see the influence of GaAs and AlGaAs shell thickness and junction positions on the solar cell performance. Further, the impact of different surface effects that exists at the semiconductor interface such as surface traps, surface recombination velocities, and associated lifetime degradation are also investigated. It has been observed that a high core and shell doping is essential to achieve the appropriate band configuration and carrier extraction. Further, it is observed that having a larger doping density is more important than having a larger lifetime. The importance of the thickness and the passivation properties of the radial and axial AlGaAs layer is also examined and it has been observed that having a thick AlGaAs shell at the cost of the i-GaAs region can be detrimental to the performance due to increased local carrier generation and recombination. Finally, the effect of having different Aluminium compositions (on the shell) on the photogeneration inside the nanowire is examined and it was observed that having a large Aluminium composition can confine most of the photogeneration to the inner GaAs regions, thus potentially allowing for thicker Aluminium shells which can more efficiently prevent surface recombination.

    "title": "Effects of head modeling errors on the spatial frequency representation  of MEG",
    "abstract": "Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM) -- next-generation magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensors -- may be placed directly on the head, unlike the more commonly used superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors, which must be placed a few centimeters away. This allows for signals of higher spatial resolution to be captured, resulting in potentially more accurate source localization. In this paper, we show that in the noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) case of approximately $\\geq 6$ dB, inaccuracies in boundary element method (BEM) head conductor models (or equivalently, inaccurate volume current models) lead to increased signal and equivalent current dipole (ECD) source localization inaccuracies when sensor arrays are placed closer to the head. This is true especially in the case of deep and superficial sources where volume current contributions are high. In the noisy case however, the higher SNR for closer sensor arrays allows for an improved ECD fit and outweighs the effects of head geometry inaccuracies. This calls for an increase in emphasis in head modeling to reduce inverse modeling errors, especially as the field of MEG strives for closer sensor arrays and cleaner signals. An analytical form to obtain the magnetic field errors for small perturbations in the BEM head geometry is also provided. ",

To date, broadband on-chip EO combs are typically generated in high-quality-factor micro-resonators, while the more straightforward and flexible non-resonant method, usually using single or cascaded EO phase modulators, often requires high driving power to realize a reasonably strong modulation index. Here, we show that the phase modulation efficiency of an integrated lithium niobate modulator could be dramatically enhanced by passing optical signals through the modulation electrodes for a total of 4 round trips, via multiple low-loss TE0/TE1 mode multiplexers and waveguide crossings, reducing electrical power consumption by more than one order of magnitude. Using devices fabricated from a wafer-scale stepper lithography process, we demonstrate a broadband optical frequency comb featuring 47 comb lines at a 25-GHz repetition rate, using a moderate RF driving power of 28 dBm (0.63 W). Leveraging the excellent tunability in repetition rate and operation wavelength, our power-efficient EO comb generator could serve as a compact low-cost solution for future high-speed data transmission, sensing and spectroscopy, as well as classical and quantum optical computation systems.

A deeply degenerate atomic mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K atoms with a large number ratio ($N_F/N_B\\approx 6$) is prepared by the mode-matching loading of atoms from a cloverleaf-type magnetic trap into a large-volume horizontal optical dipole trap and evaporative cooling in a large-volume three-beam optical dipole trap.

In the atom-molecule mixture, the elastic collisions provide a thermalization mechanism for the molecules. In a few tens of milliseconds which are larger than the typical thermalization time, the degeneracy of the molecules is maintained, which may be due to the Pauli exclusion principle.

The metacrystal unit cell consists of the bound pair of solitons, and the distance between them is used as a control parameter. We are reporting the soliton metacrystal band structure and its topological properties. The latter is confirmed by the existence of the $\\pi$ steps experienced by the crystal phonons' geometrical (Zak) phase. Furthermore, we found the phononic edge states in the metacrystals with defects made by removing several solitons. Optical frequency combs corresponding to the soliton metacrystals reveal the spectral butterfly pattern serving as a signature of the spatio-temporal chirality and bearing a resemblance to the butterfly wings illustrating natural occurrences of chirality.

We introduce the concept of optical fingerprint for the deterministic speckle pattern associated with a particular substrate surface area and intentionally enhance the speckle amplitudes for potential applications. We demonstrate such optical fingerprints can be utilized for reproducible position identification and marker-free lateral displacement detection with an experimental precision of 0.22 nm. The reproducible position identification allows us to detect new nanoscopic features developed during laborious processes performed outside of the microscope. The demonstrated capability for ultrasensitive displacement detection may find applications in the semiconductor industry and super-resolution optical microscopy. ",

    "abstract": "Introducing angular dispersion into a pulsed field associates each frequency with a particular angle with respect to the propagation axis. A perennial yet implicit assumption is that the propagation angle is differentiable with respect to the frequency. Recent work has shown that the existence of a frequency at which the derivative of the propagation angle does not exist -- which we refer to as non-differentiable angular dispersion -- allows for the optical field to exhibit unique and useful characteristics that are unattainable by endowing optical fields with conventional angular dispersion. Because these novel features are retained in principle even when the specific non-differentiable frequency is not part of the selected spectrum, the question arises as to the impact of the proximity of the spectrum to this frequency. We show here that operating in the vicinity of the non-differentiable frequency is imperative to reduce the deleterious impact of (1) errors in implementing the angular-dispersion profile, and (2) the spectral uncertainty intrinsic to finite-energy wave packets in any realistic system. Non-differential angular dispersion can then be viewed as a resource -- quantified by a Schmidt number -- that is maximized in the vicinity of the non-differentiable frequency. These results will be useful in designing novel phase-matching of nonlinear interactions in dispersive media. ",

We derive estimates for the flow reconstruction error, storage requirements and computational cost of our method. We show, with examples, that our tensor-based method is significantly more accurate than similar vectorized methods. Furthermore, the variance of the error is smaller when using our tensor-based method. While the computational cost of our method is comparable to similar vectorized methods, it reduces the storage cost by several orders of magnitude. The reduced storage cost becomes even more pronounced as the dimension of the flow increases. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on two examples: a chaotic Kolmogorov flow and the in-situ and satellite measurements of the global sea surface temperature. ",

Hybrid kinetic-MHD model simulations of the energetic particle (EP) driven kink/fishbone modes on a static HL-2A-like tokamak using NIMROD code find that, when the background plasma pressure is relatively high, and the EP pressure and the beam energy are relatively low, the mode frequency increases almost linearly with EP pressure, and the frequency is proportional to n (\"frequency multiplication\"), even in absence of any equilibrium plasma rotation. In addition, the frequency multiplication persists as the safety factor at magnetic axis q0 varies. In absence of EPs, the growth rate of the 1/1 mode is the largest; however, as the EP pressure increases, the growth rate of 2/2 modes or 3/3 modes becomes dominant, suggesting that the higher-n modes are more vulnerable to EPs. These results may shed light on the understanding about the toroidal mode number dependence of kink/fishbone modes in the advanced scenarios of tokamaks with weak or reversed central magnetic shear.

Here, we propose a so-called shared-volume concept to use the volume required for both subsystems more efficiently, in which the MR transparency of the scintillator is exploited by integrating the RF shielding into the scintillator of the PET detector. Semi-monolithic scintillator prototypes (PVC slabs) of 7 mm and 12 mm height with integrated copper foil between every and every other slab, respectively, were investigated to evaluate the shielding effectiveness (SE). The SE was measured with probes on a test bench system. In addition, the PET detector performance was evaluated by determining the positioning using gradient tree boosting, energy and timing resolution using digital SiPM arrays (DPC3200, PDPC) in three LYSO scintillator configurations: ESR separation (Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR}}$), ESR with copper foil in between (Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR+Cu}}$), and purely copper foil separation (Slab$\\mathrm{_{Cu}}$). The prototype with shielding between each slab and 12 mm height showed the highest SE with 31 dB (mean) in combination with a supporting frame. While Slab$\\mathrm{_{Cu}}$ was best for positioning, followed by Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR}}$ and Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR+Cu}}$, the Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR}}$ had the best energy resolution (10.6 %), followed by Slab$\\mathrm{_{ESR+Cu}}$ (11.2 %) and Slab$\\mathrm{_{Cu}}$ (12.6 %).

    "abstract": "This study investigates the ultrafast dynamics of coherent phonons and phonon-polaritons in lithium niobate (LiNbO$_{3}$) crystals using reflective pump-probe spectroscopy with 25-fs time resolution. In addition to several coherent optical phonon modes, the electro-optic sampling measurements explored the coexistence of phonon-polariton E-modes near 3.8 and 14.9 THz, which agrees considerably with the theoretical phonon-polariton dispersion curves. We also discovered that a time lag ($\\Delta$t $\\approx$ 0.2 ps) between the coherent optical phonon and phonon-polariton originates from the coupling time for propagating phonon-polariton. Our findings provide a possible application of LiNbO$_{3}$ for ultrafast electro-optic phonon modulators with bandwidths greater than 10 THz. ",

    "abstract": "Optical soliton molecules in ultrafast lasers present striking analogies with their matter molecule counterparts, such as internal vibrations. However, the vibrations of soliton molecules are nonlinear, with frequencies that are sensitive to the system parameters, thus presenting an opportunity of control. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the synchronization of the internal vibrations of self-excited vibrating soliton molecules through a modulated optical injection. We show efficient sub-harmonic, fundamental and super-harmonic synchronization, forming a pattern of Arnold tongues with respect to the injection strength. Our observations are supported by numerical simulations. ",

By modeling the light-matter interaction with a many-body Hamiltonian, we demonstrate the spontaneous generation of Dicke squeezing and many-particle entanglement of atomic motional states, occurring due to self-organization of photons and atoms in the stripe phase. Once generated, these squeezed states are maintained after a sudden switch-off of the laser pump in a dissipative cavity. Our results highlight the potential of using self-organization of atomic motion as a tool for quantum metrology. ",

    "abstract": "We consider semiclassical Maxwell--Schr\\\"odinger system for the solid state laser which consists of the Maxwell equations coupled to $N\\sim 10^{20}$ Schr\\\"odinger equations for active molecules. The system contains time-periodic pumping and a weak dissipation. We introduce the corresponding Poincar\\'e map $P$ and consider the differential $DP(Y^0)$ at suitable stationary state $Y^0$. We conjecture that the {\\it stable laser action} is due to the {\\it parametric resonance} (PR) which means that the maximal absolute value of the corresponding multipliers is sufficiently large. The multipliers are defined as eigenvalues of $DP(Y^0)$. The PR makes the stationary state $Y^0$ highly unstable, and we suppose that this instability maintains the {\\it coherent laser radiation}. We prove that the spectrum Spec$\\,DP(Y^0)$ is approximately symmetric with respect to the unit circle $|\\mu|=1$ if the dissipation is sufficiently small. More detailed results are obtained for the Maxwell--Bloch system. We calculate the corresponding Poincar\\'e map $P$ by successive approximations. The key role in checking the PR is played by the sum of $N$ positive terms arising in the calculation of the second-order approximation for the total current. This fact can be interpreted as the {\\it synchronization of molecular currents} in all active molecules, which is provisionally in line with the role of {\\it stimulated emission} in the laser action. The calculation of the sum relies on probabilistic arguments which is one of main novelties of our approach. Other main novelties are i) the calculation of the differential $DP(Y^0)$ in the ``Hopf representation'', ii) the block structure of the differential, and iii) the justification of the ``rotating wave approximation'' by a new estimate for the averaging of slow rotations.

    "abstract": "We report deep learning-based design of a massively parallel broadband diffractive neural network for all-optically performing a large group of arbitrarily-selected, complex-valued linear transformations between an input and output field-of-view, each with N_i and N_o pixels, respectively. This broadband diffractive processor is composed of N_w wavelength channels, each of which is uniquely assigned to a distinct target transformation. A large set of arbitrarily-selected linear transformations can be individually performed through the same diffractive network at different illumination wavelengths, either simultaneously or sequentially (wavelength scanning). We demonstrate that such a broadband diffractive network, regardless of its material dispersion, can successfully approximate N_w unique complex-valued linear transforms with a negligible error when the number of diffractive neurons (N) in its design matches or exceeds 2 x N_w x N_i x N_o. We further report that the spectral multiplexing capability (N_w) can be increased by increasing N; our numerical analyses confirm these conclusions for N_w > 180, which can be further increased to e.g., ~2000 depending on the upper bound of the approximation error. Massively parallel, wavelength-multiplexed diffractive networks will be useful for designing high-throughput intelligent machine vision systems and hyperspectral processors that can perform statistical inference and analyze objects/scenes with unique spectral properties.

We demonstrate the capabilities of QIPA as applied to three different global-optimization numerical experiments: the ground-state optimization of the $H_2$ molecular dissociation, search of the transmon qubit ground-state, and biprime factorization. Since our algorithm is hybrid, quantum/classical technologies such as error mitigation and adaptive variational ansatzes can easily be incorporated into the algorithm. Due to the shallow quantum circuit requirements, we anticipate large-scale implementation and adoption of the proposed algorithm across current major quantum hardware. ",
