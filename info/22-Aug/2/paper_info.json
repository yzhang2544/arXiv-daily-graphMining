    "abstract": "This paper presents the detailed study of the controlled experimental observation and characterization of Ion Acoustic soliton in the quiescent argon plasma produced by filamentary discharge and confined in a multi-pole line cusp magnetic field device named Multi-pole line Cusp Plasma Device (MPD). In this system, the electrostatic fluctuations are found to be less than 1%, a characteristic of quiescent plasma. Ion acoustic soliton has been excited in MPD, and its propagation velocity and width of them are measured experimentally and compared with the 1-D Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The interaction of two counter-propagating solitons is also investigated to confirm propagation's solitary nature further. After the successful characterization of ion-acoustic soliton, the effect of varying the cusp magnetic field on the propagation of ion-acoustic soliton has been studied. It is experimentally observed in MPD that the pole cusp magnetic field value influences the excitation and propagation of solitons. The soliton amplitude increases with the pole field up to some value Bp~0.6kG, then decreases with the further increase in field values. Meanwhile, the width of the soliton shows different behavior. The role of primary electron confinement by cusp magnetic field geometry has been used to explain the observed results. ",

    "abstract": "Formation of a peculiar lasing pattern leading to a TEM00-like mode accompanied by a nonzero bright outer-ring emission (namely, a modified TEM00 mode) was observed in a 300-\\mu m-thick LiNdP4O12 (LNP) laser with reflective flat end mirrors that was pumped with a laser diode whose focused spot size was larger than the lasing beam spot size determined by the thermal lens effect. The photon lifetimes of the laser oscillations were found to be greatly shortened to \\tau_{p} = 6.74 ps as compared with those in pure TEM00 mode operation, while the fluorescence lifetime was \\tau = 130 \\mu s. The formation of the peculiar transverse mode was theoretically treated in terms of the pump-intensity-dependent thermal lens effect, which yields the lasing beam spot sizes in the resultant optical cavity. In addition, transverse spatial hole burning of population inversions due to the preceding transverse eigenmode intensity and the associated anti-guidance of the pure TEM00 field leading to formation of the TEM00 with an emergent outer ring emission was shown to appear with increasing pump power through the electric lens (i.e., population lens) effect, in which almost all of the population inversion contributes to lasing with a pronounced effective modal gain. Self-mixing laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) experiments and numerical simulations revealed that spontaneous emission factors in the peculiar mode oscillations were greatly decreased in comparison with those in pure TEM00 mode operation. The present thin-slice solid-state laser possessing a large fluorescence-to-photon lifetime and decreased spontaneous emission factor enabled us to detect LDV signals in the regime of few feedback photons per observation period.

    "abstract": "Photonic time-varying systems have attracted significant attention owing to their rich physics and potential opportunities for new and enhanced functionalities. In this context, the duality of space and time in wave physics has been particularly fruitful to uncover interesting physical effects in the temporal domain, such as reflection/refraction at temporal interfaces and momentum-bandgaps in time crystals. However, the characteristics of the temporal/frequency dimension, particularly its relation to causality and energy conservation ($\\hbar \\omega$ is energy, whereas $\\hbar \\boldsymbol{k}$ is momentum), create challenges and constraints that are unique to time-varying systems and are not present in their spatially varying counterparts. Here, we overview two key physical aspects of time-varying photonics that have only received marginal attention so far, namely temporal dispersion and external power requirements, and explore their implications. We discuss how temporal dispersion, an inherent property of any causal material, makes the fields evolve continuously at sharp temporal interfaces and may limit the strength of fast temporal modulations and of various resulting effects. Furthermore, we show that changing the refractive index in time always involves large amounts of energy. We derive power requirements to observe a time-crystal response in one of the most popular material platforms in time-varying photonics, i.e., transparent conducting oxides, and we argue that these effects are almost always obscured by less exotic nonlinear phenomena. These observations and findings shed light on the physics and constraints of time-varying photonics, and may guide the design and implementation of future time-modulated photonic systems. ",

The disc-shaped resonator is fabricated using single-point diamond turning and exhibits a high intrinsic quality factor ($Q$) on the order of $10^9$. Moreover, we employ a novel method based on microscopic imaging of Newton's rings through the back of a trapezoidal prism. This method can be used to evanescently couple light in to a WGMR and monitor the separation between the cavity and the coupling prism. Accurately calibrating the distance between a coupling prism and a WGMR is desirable as it can be used to improve experimental control and conditions, i.e., accurate coupler gap calibration can aid in tuning into desired coupling regimes and can be used to avoid potential damage caused by collisions between the coupling prism and the WGMR. Here, we use two different trapezoidal prisms together with the high-$Q$ YLF WGMR to demonstrate and discuss this method. ",

The cold plasma technology is expected to bring a benefit in this context. Six different plasma sources, based on printed circuit boards, were evaluated fourfold. This include measurements of the power consumption, the ignition behavior by an ICCD-camera and ozone formation by absorption spectroscopy at 254 nm. To evaluate the biocidal effect, four bacterial test series were performed with Escherichia coli. The entirety of the tests analyze the plasma inactivation process from the input parameters to the desired biocidal effect. The discharge current and time resolved ignition behaviors indicated a simultaneous formation of filaments at the beginning of the negative half-cycle. The dynamics of the ozone production showed a saturated exponential growth upon a maximum value of 435 ppm. Additionally, the microbiological test series unveiled differences between the plasma source concepts. A total reduction rate of Log-4 within a minute was achievable. An air flow through slits within the plasma sources destabilized the plasma. Minor changes of the electrode geometry changed all measured parameters. Hence, to develop a pathogen inactivating plasma source, these results recommend a comb-shaped electrode design, which is laminated on a dielectric. ",

The observed 50% population increase in the pumped F=2, m$_F$=2 Zeeman substate along with the depopulation of remaining Zeeman substates enabled us to achieve a 3 times improvement in the relative population of the m$_F$=2 substate within the F=2 manifold, with 60% of the F=2 population residing in the m$_F$=2 dark sublevel.

The fractional frequency stability of the measured terahertz signal is evaluated to be $\\sim$8.0$\\times$10$^{- 17}$ after 730 s. The frequency accuracy of the obtained terahertz spectrum is ensured by phase-locking the two frequency combs to a frequency standard. To clarify the performance of our system, we characterized the absorption line of water vapor around 0.557 THz. The good agreement of the measured center frequency and linewidth with the values predicted from the HITRAN database verifies the suitability of our ASOPS THz-TDS system for precise measurements. ",

    "abstract": "We present the results of a study of the Poynting vector field generic singularities at the resonant light scattering of a plane monochromatic linearly polarized electromagnetic wave by a subwavelength particle. We reveal the impact of the problem symmetry, the spatial dimension, and the energy conservation law on the properties of the singularities. We show that, in the cases when the problem symmetry results in the existence of an invariant plane for the Poynting vector field lines, a formation of a standing wave in the immediate vicinity of a singularity gives rise to a saddle-type singular point. All other types of singularities are associated with vanishing at the singular points, either (i) magnetic field, for the polarization plane parallel to the invariant plane, or (ii) electric field, at the perpendicular orientation of the polarization plane. We also show that in the case of two-dimensional problems (scattering by a cylinder), the energy conservation law restricts the types of possible singularities only to saddles and centers in the non-dissipative media and to saddles, foci, and nodes in dissipative. Finally, we show that dissipation affects the (i)-type singularities much stronger than the (ii)-type. The same conclusions are valid for the imaginary part of the Poynting vector in problems where the latter is regarded as a complex quantity. The singular points associated with the formation of standing waves are different for real and imaginary parts of this complex vector field, while all other singularities are common. We illustrate the general discussion by analyzing singularities at light scattering by a subwavelength Germanium cylinder with the actual dispersion of its refractive index. ",

While optical manipulation offers almost arbitrary flexibility, the precise control of the resulting dipole potentials and the mitigation of unwanted disturbances is quite involved and only heuristic algorithms with rather slow convergence rates are available up to now. This paper thus suggests the application of iterative learning control (ILC) methods to generate fine-tuned effective potentials in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. Therefore, the given problem is reformulated to obtain a one-dimensional tracking problem by using a quasicontinuous input mapping which can be treated by established ILC methods.

The Kraus form ensures that the reconstructed process is completely positive. To make the process trace-preserving, we use a constrained gradient-descent (GD) approach on the so-called Stiefel manifold during optimization to obtain the Kraus operators. Our ansatz uses a few Kraus operators to avoid direct estimation of large process matrices, e.g., the Choi matrix, for low-rank quantum processes. The GD-QPT matches the performance of both compressed-sensing (CS) and projected least-squares (PLS) QPT in benchmarks with two-qubit random processes, but shines by combining the best features of these two methods. Similar to CS (but unlike PLS), GD-QPT can reconstruct a process from just a small number of random measurements, and similar to PLS (but unlike CS) it also works for larger system sizes, up to at least five qubits. We envisage that the data-driven approach of GD-QPT can become a practical tool that greatly reduces the cost and computational effort for QPT in intermediate-scale quantum systems. ",

As compared to more common FSO systems exploiting the telecom range, the larger wavelength employed in Mid-IR systems delivers exceptional benefits in case of adverse atmospheric conditions, as the reduced scattering rate strongly suppresses detrimental effects on the FSO link length given by the presence of rain, dust, fog and haze. In this work, we use a novel FSO testbed operating at \\SI{4.7}{\\micro m}, to provide a detailed experimental analysis of noise regimes that could occur in realistic FSO Mid-IR systems based on QCLs. Our analysis reveals the existence of two distinct noise regions, corresponding to different realistic channel attenuation conditions, which are precisely controlled in our setup. To relate our results with real outdoor configurations, we combine experimental data with predictions of an atmospheric channel loss model, finding that error-free communication could be attained for effective distances up to 8~km in low visibility conditions of 1 km.

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate the enhanced atmospheric turbulence resiliency in a 137.8 Gbit/s/mode mode-division multiplexing free-space optical communication link through the application of a successive interference cancellation digital signal processing algorithm. The turbulence resiliency is further enhanced through redundant receive channels in the mode-division multiplexing link. The proof of concept demonstration is performed using commercially available mode-selective photonic lanterns, a commercial transponder, and a spatial light modulator based turbulence emulator. In this link, 5 spatial modes with each mode carrying 34.46 GBaud dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying signals are successfully transmitted with an average bit error rate lower than the hard-decision forward error correction limit. As a result, we achieved a record-high mode- and polarization-division multiplexing channel number of 10, a record-high line rate of 689.23 Gbit/s, and a record-high net spectral efficiency of 13.9 bit/s/Hz in emulated turbulent links in a mode-division multiplexing free-space optical system.

    "title": "Fast-forwarding quantum simulation with real-time quantum Krylov  subspace algorithms",
    "abstract": "Quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) algorithms have emerged as a competitive family of algorithms that avoid many of the optimization pitfalls associated with parameterized quantum circuit algorithms. While the vast majority of the QSD algorithms have focused on solving the eigenpair problem for ground, excited-state, and thermal observable estimation, there has been a lot less work in considering QSD algorithms for the problem of quantum dynamical simulation. In this work, we propose several quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (QKFF) algorithms capable of predicting long-time dynamics well beyond the coherence time of current quantum hardware. Our algorithms use real-time evolved Krylov basis states prepared on the quantum computer and a multi-reference subspace method to ensure convergence towards high-fidelity, long-time dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed multi-reference methodology provides a systematic way of trading off circuit depth with classical post-processing complexity. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical implementations for several quantum chemistry problems including the calculation of the auto-correlation and dipole moment correlation functions ",

    "title": "Influence of the coordination defects on the dynamics and the potential  energy landscape of two-dimensional silica",
    "abstract": "The main cause of the fragile-to-strong crossover of 3D silica was previously attributed to the presence of a low energy cutoff in the potential energy landscape. The important question emerges about the microscopic origin of this crossover and the generalizibility to other glass-formers. In this work, the fragile-to-strong crossover of a model 2D glassy system is analyzed via molecular dynamics simulation, which represents 2D-silica. By separating the sampled defect and defect-free inherent structures, we are able to identify their respective density of state distributions with respect to energy. A low energy cutoff is found in both distributions. It is shown that the fragile-to-strong crossover can be quantitatively related to the parameters of the energy landscape, involving in particular the low-energy cutoff of the energy distribution. It is also shown that the low-energy cutoff of the defect-states is determined by the formation energy of a specific defect configuration, involving two silicon and no oxygen defect. The low-temperature behavior of 2D silica is quantitatively compared with that of 3D silica, showing surprisingly similar behavior. ",
