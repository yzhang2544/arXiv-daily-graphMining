    "title": "Why Ortho- and Para-Hydroxy Metabolites Can Scavenge Free Radicals that  the Parent Atorvastatin Cannot? Important Pharmacologic Insight from Quantum  Chemistry",
    "abstract": "The pharmaceutical success of atorvastatin (ATV), a widely employed drug against the \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) and cardiovascular diseases, traces back to its ability to scavenge free radicals. Unfortunately, information on its antioxidant properties is missing or unreliable. Here, we report detailed quantum chemical results for ATV and its ortho- and para-hydroxy metabolites (o-ATV, p-ATV) in the methanolic phase. They comprise global reactivity indices, bond order indices, and spin densities as well as all relevant enthalpies of reaction (bond dissociation BDE, ionization IP and electron attachment EA, proton detachment PDE and proton affinity PA, and electron transfer ETE). With these properties in hand, we can provide the first theoretical explanation of the experimental finding that, due to their free radical scavenging activity, ATV hydroxy metabolites rather than the parent ATV, have substantial inhibitory effect on LDL and the like. Surprisingly (because it is contrary to the most cases currently known), we unambiguously found that HAT (direct hydrogen atom transfer) rather than SPLET (sequential proton loss electron transfer) or SET-PT (stepwise electron transfer proton transfer) is the thermodynamically preferred pathway by which o-ATV and p-ATV in methanolic phase can scavenge DPPH$^\\bullet$ (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. From a quantum chemical perspective, the ATV's species investigated are surprising because of the nontrivial correlations between bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, bond order indices and pertaining stretching frequencies, which do not fit the framework of naive chemical intuition.

    "title": "High-speed tunable microwave-rate soliton microcomb",
    "abstract": "Microwave signal generation with fast frequency tuning underlies many applications including sensing, imaging, ranging, time keeping, wireless communication, and high-speed electronics. Soliton microcombs are a promising new approach for photonic-based microwave signal synthesis. To date, however, tuning rate has been limited in microcombs (and in frequency combs generally). Here, we demonstrate the first microwave-rate soliton microcomb whose repetition rate can be tuned at a high speed. By integrating an electro-optic tuning/modulation element into a lithium niobate comb microresonator, a modulation bandwidth up to 75 MHz and a continuous frequency modulation rate up to 5.0 * 10^14 Hz/s are achieved, several orders-of-magnitude faster than existing microcomb technology. These features are especially useful for disciplining an optical VCO to a long-term reference such as an optical clock or for tight phase lock in dual-microcomb clocks or synthesizers. Moreover, the microwave signal rate can be set to any X - W band rate. Besides its positive impact on microwave photonics, fast repetition rate control is generally important in all applications of frequency combs. ",

    "abstract": "Experimental results, supported by precise modelling, demonstrate optimisation of a plasma-based injector with intermediate laser pulse energy ($<1$~J), corresponding to a normalised vector potential $a_0 = 2.15$, using ionisation injection in a tailored plasma density profile. An increase in electron bunch quality and energy is achieved experimentally with the extension of the density downramp at the plasma exit. Optimisation of the focal position of the laser pulse in the tailored plasma density profile is shown to efficiently reduce electron bunch angular deviation, leading to a better alignment of the electron bunch with the laser axis. Single peak electron spectra are produced in a previously unexplored regime by combining an early focal position and adaptive optic control of the laser wavefront through optimising the symmetry of the pre-focal laser energy distribution. Experimental results have been validated through particle-in-cell simulations using realistic laser energy, phase distribution, and temporal envelope, allowing for accurate predictions of difficult to model parameters, such as total charge and spatial properties of the electron bunches, opening the way for more accurate modelling for the design of plasma-based accelerators.

What are the expectations regarding the future relevance of second generation quantum technologies? And what are the requirements for the workforce in the coming quantum industry? What competences, knowledge and skills should the future employees have? In this paper, we report the results of our Delphi study that was aimed at mapping requirements and forecasts for the future quantum workforce. Our Delphi study consisted of three consecutive survey rounds. In total, we gathered 188 responses from industry and academic experts across Europe. Our study results served as an input for the development of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, delivered by the project QTEdu CSA for the European Quantum Flagship. In addition, we will discuss predictions from experts related to the future quantum workforce, including the expected industrial relevance of the main areas of quantum technologies, the need for educational efforts, and the expected influence of quantum technologies on everyday life.

    "abstract": "We present octave-wide bandpass filters in the terahertz (THz) region based on bilayer-metamaterial (BLMM) structures. The passband region has a super-Gaussian shape with a maximum transmittance approaching 70% and a typical stopband rejection of 20 dB. The design is based on a metasurface consisting of a metallic square-hole array deposited on a transparent polymer, which is stacked on top of an identical metasurface with a sub-wavelength separation. The superimposed metasurface structures were designed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and fabricated using a photolithography process. Experimental characterization of these structures between 0.3 to 5.8 THz is performed with a time-domain THz spectroscopy system. Good agreement between experiment and simulation results is observed. We also demonstrate that two superimposed BLMM (2BLMM) devices increase the steepness of the roll-offs to more than 85 dB/octave and enable a superior stopband rejection approaching 40 dB while the maximum transmittance remains above 64%. This work paves the way toward new THz applications, including the detection of THz pulses centered at specific frequencies, and an enhanced time-resolved detection sensitivity towards molecular vibrations that are noise dominated by a strong, off-resonant, driving field.
