    "title": "Democratization of Quantum Technologies",
    "abstract": "As quantum technologies (QT) have been becoming more and more realized, their potential impact on and relation with society has been developing into a pressing issue for exploration. In this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of QT, particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First, we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory, representative, and deliberative), and how the concept of democratization can be formulated with respect to these frameworks. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of democratization is utilized by the actors in the QT field. Democratization is mainly adopted by companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding of the concept. We provide a discussion on where to locate this formulation of democratization used by the QT community within the overall conceptual landscape of democracy theories. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives concerning democratization in QT and we propose a five-step approach to operationalizing the concept of democratization with respect to different theories of democracy. Finally, we explore the concept of democratization in QT beyond quantum computing. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the democratization of QT are necessary steps towards the democratization of this set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to argue that QT is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in the QT field and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on democratization of QT can result in a better technology for the society.

    "abstract": "Solving mathematical equations faster and more efficiently has been a Holy Grail for centuries for scientists and engineers across all disciplines. While electronic digital circuits have revolutionized equation solving in recent decades, it has become apparent that performance gains from brute-force approaches of compute-solvers are quickly saturating over time. Instead, paradigms that leverage the universes natural tendency to minimize a systems free energy, such as annealers or Ising Machines, are being sought after due to favorable complexity scaling. Here we introduce a programmable analog solver leveraging the mathematical formal equivalence between Maxwells equations and photonic circuitry. It features a mesh network of nanophotonic beams to find solutions to partial differential equations. As an example, we designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a novel application-specific photonic integrated circuit comprised of electro-optically reconfigurable nodes, and experimentally validated 90% accuracy with respect to a commercial solver. Finally, we tested this photonic integrated chip performance by simulating thermal diffusion on a spacecrafts heat shield during re-entry to a planets atmosphere. The programmable light-circuitry presented herein offers a facile route for solving complex problems and thus will have profound potential applications across many scientific and engineering fields.

A set of representative 2-channel and 3-channel WDDs schemes were demonstrated for input TE00/TM00 modes and operating in different bands, showing the flexibility of our design approach. The proposed WDD schemes are compatible with visible to infrared wavelengths, photolithography-based fabrication, high efficiency with maximum transmission of 91%, and a small footprint at a few microns.

    "abstract": "Optical second harmonic generation is a second-order nonlinear process by which two photons of a given frequency can combine in a nonlinear medium to generate a third photon at twice the frequency. Since the electric-dipole SHG process only occurs in non-centrosymmetric crystals, it is widely used as a sensitive probe to detect broken inversion symmetry and local polar order. Analytical modeling of the SHG response of a nonlinear optical material is essential to extract fundamental properties of materials from experiments. However, complexity builds up dramatically in the analytical model when the probed crystal is of a low bulk crystal symmetry, with a surface cut in a low-symmetry orientation, exhibits absorption and dispersion, and consists of multiple interfaces. As a result, there is a largely uneven landscape in the literature on the SHG modeling of new materials, involving numerous approximations and a wide range of (in)accuracies, leading to a rather scattered dataset of reported SHG nonlinear susceptibility. Towards streamlining the reliability and accuracy of this process, we have developed an open-source package called the Second Harmonic Analysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry (SHAARP) which derives analytical solutions and performs numerical simulations of reflection SHG polarimetry from a single interface for bulk homogeneous crystals with arbitrary symmetry group, arbitrary crystal orientation, complex and anisotropic linear dielectric tensor with frequency dispersion, a general SHG tensor and arbitrary polarization of the incident and the detected SHG light. SHAARP enables accurate modeling of polarimetry measurements in reflection geometry from highly absorbing crystals or transparent crystals for extracting crystal symmetry and the complete set of quantitative SHG tensor coefficients. The method is extendible to multiple interfaces. ",

For relativistic electrons, the attosec bunch has a spatial length of a few nanometers, which is well suited for generating high-brightness superradiance in the VUV, EUV, and x-ray spectra. Our study shows that the brilliance of coherent undulator radiation driven by a short-bunch beam with 1~10 fC bunch charge from a dielectric laser accelerator is comparable to or higher than that of a synchrotron in the 0.1 ~ 3 keV photon energy range, even though the beam power of the dielectric laser accelerator is about a million times lower than that of a synchrotron. When the brilliance under comparison is normalized to the electron beam power, the proposed coherent undulator radiation source becomes the brightest source on earth across the whole VUV, EUV, and soft x-ray spectrum.

We observed the incident photons passing through the photoisomerization memory pathways by a double-probe optical near-field microscope, with one probe located on the front surface for local excitation and the other on the rear surface for near-field observation. By carrying out localized near-field excitation twice but at spatially different positions, we observed negatively correlated near-field output patterns between the first memory pathway and the second memory pathway. That is, the added memory pathway was formed exclusively to the previously formed memory pathway. We also confirmed that the first memory pathway was preserved after the second memory pathway was formed. This result indicates that photoisomerization by an optical near-field in diarylethene crystals has a history dependence, leading to brain-like dynamic information memorization using light-matter interactions on the nanometer-scale.

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have provided unprecedented degree of freedom (DOF) in manipulating electromagnetic (EM) waves. Geometric phase can be readily obtained by rotating the meta-atom of metasurfaces. Nevertheless, such geometric phases are usually spin-coupled, with the same magnitude but opposite signs for left_ and right_handed circularly polarized (LCP,RCP) waves. To achieve independent control on LCP and RCP waves, it is crucial to obtain spin-decoupled geometric phases. In this paper, we propose to obtain completely spin-decoupled geometric phases by engineering surface current paths on meta-atoms. Based on the rotational Doppler effect, the rotation manner is firstly analyzed and it is found that the essence of generating geometric phase lies in the rotation of surface current paths on meta-atoms. Since the induced surface currents paths under LCP and RCP waves always start oppositely and are mirror-symmetrical with each other, it is natural that the geometric phases be with the same magnitude and opposite signs when the meta-atoms are rotated. To obtain spin-decoupled geometric phases, the start point of induced surface current under one spin should be rotated by an angle while that under the other spin by another different angle. In this way, LCP and RCP waves can acquire different geometric phase changes and spin-decoupled geometric phase can be imparted by metasurfaces. Proof-of-principle prototypes were designed, fabricated and measured. Both the simulation and experiment results verify spin-decoupled geometric phases. This work provides a robust means of obtaining spin-dependent geometric phase and will further adds up to the metasurface DOF in manipulating EM waves. ",

The optical phase-locked loop between two optical paths derived from the same laser provides an easy frequency manipulation between two laser frequencies separated by hyperfine frequency of 6.835 GHz using AOM and EOM respectively. The optical phase-locked loop also provides a convenient way for vibration compensation through the Raman lasers' phase offset.

We then use these results to demonstrate optical guiding over ~45 m in the hallway adjacent to the lab, corresponding to ~70 Rayleigh lengths.

We show that the instability is realized in the quantum theory as a cascade of the wave function in the space of occupation number states, and an unstable quantum system has a richer spectrum and a much longer recurrence time than a stable quantum system.

The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes' law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system.

    "title": "Spectroscopic performance of flight-like DEPFET sensors for Athena's WFI",
    "abstract": "The Wide Field Imager for the Athena X-ray telescope is composed of two back side illuminated detectors using DEPFET sensors operated in rolling shutter readout mode: A large detector array featuring four sensors with 512x512 pixels each and a small detector that facilitates the high count rate capability of the WFI for the investigation of bright, point-like sources. Both sensors were fabricated in full size featuring the pixel layout, fabrication technology and readout mode chosen in a preceding prototyping phase. We present the spectroscopic performance of these flight-like detectors for different photon energies in the relevant part of the targeted energy range from 0.2 keV to 15 keV with respect to the timing requirements of the instrument. For 5.9 keV photons generated by an iron-55 source the spectral performance expressed as Full Width at Half Maximum of the emission peak in the spectrum is 126.0 eV for the Large Detector and 129.1 eV for the Fast Detector. A preliminary analysis of the camera's signal chain also allows for a first prediction of the performance in space at the end of the nominal operation phase. ",
