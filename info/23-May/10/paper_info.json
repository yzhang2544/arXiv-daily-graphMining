    "title": "Femtosecond laser direct-write photoconductive patterns on tellurite  glass",
    "abstract": "We report the formation of arbitrary photoconductive patterns made of tellurium (Te) nanocrystals by exposing a tellurite (TeO2-based) glass to femtosecond laser pulses. During this process, Te/TeO2-glass nanocomposite interfaces with photoconductive properties form on the tellurite glass substrate. We show that these laser-written patterns have a highly reproducible photo-response, from the near ultraviolet (263 nm) to the visible spectrum, stable over a few months. Specifically, high responsivity (16.55 A/W) and detectivity (5.25*10^11 Jones) of a single laser-written line pattern are measured for an illumination dose of 0.07 mW/cm^2 at 400 nm. This work illustrates a pathway for locally turning a tellurite glass into functional photoconductor of arbitrary shape, without adding materials and using a single laser process step. ",

    "abstract": "Scalar field should have no spin angular momentum according to conventional understandings in classical field theory. Yet, recent studies demonstrate the undoubted existence of wave spin endowed by acoustic and elastic longitudinal waves, which are of irrotational curl-free nature without vorticity and can be described by scalar fields. Here, to solve this seeming discrepancy, we uncover the origin of wave spin in scalar fields beyond traditional formalism by clarifying that the presence of higher order derivatives in scalar field Lagrangians can give rise to non-vanishing spin. For scalar fields with only first order derivative, we can make the hidden wave spin emerge, by constructing a latent field that leads to the original field through a time derivative so that is of second order. We exemplify the wave spin for elastic and acoustic fields, as well as for dissipative media, following Noether's theorem in higher-order derivative Lagrangian. The results would prompt people to build more comprehensive and fundamental understandings of structural wave spin in classical fields. ",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of unsteady vortical flow fields from limited sensor measurements is challenging. We develop machine learning methods to reconstruct flow features from sparse sensor measurements during transient vortex-airfoil wake interaction using only a limited amount of training data. The present machine learning models accurately reconstruct the aerodynamic force coefficients, pressure distributions over airfoil surface, and two-dimensional vorticity field for a variety of untrained cases. Multi-layer perceptron is used for estimating aerodynamic forces and pressure profiles over the surface, establishing a nonlinear model between the pressure sensor measurements and the output variables. A combination of multi-layer perceptron with convolutional neural network is utilized to reconstruct the vortical wake. Furthermore, the use of transfer learning and long short-term memory algorithm combined in the training models greatly improves the reconstruction of transient wakes by embedding the dynamics. The present machine-learning methods are able to estimate the transient flow features while exhibiting robustness against noisy sensor measurements. Finally, appropriate sensor locations over different time periods are assessed for accurately estimating the wakes. The present study offers insights into the dynamics of vortex-airfoil interaction and the development of data-driven flow estimation. ",

We have developed a compact single-shot photon spectrometer to diagnose soft X-ray spectra. The spectrometer consists of an array of off-axis Fresnel zone plates (FZP) that act as transmission-imaging gratings, a Ce-YAG scintillator, and a microscope objective to image the scintillation target onto a two-dimensional imaging detector. This spectrometer operates in an energy range which covers absorption edges associated with several atomic constituents carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. The spectrometer's performance is demonstrated at a repetition rate of 120 Hz, but our detection scheme can be easily extended to 200 kHz spectral collection by employing a fast complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) line-scan camera to detect the light from the scintillator. This compact photon spectrometer provides an opportunity for monitoring the spectrum downstream of an endstation in a limited space environment with subelectronvolt energy resolution. ",

Typically, Tr-XES/XAS requires X-ray pulses with both a narrow bandwidth and sub-picosecond pulse duration, a combination that in principle finds its optimum with Fourier transform-limited pulses. In this work, we explore an alternative xperimental approach, capable of simultaneously retrieving information about unoccupied (XAS) and occupied (XES) states from the stochastic fluctuations of broadband extreme ultraviolet pulses of a free-electron laser. We used this method, in combination with singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization procedures, to determine the XAS/XES response from a crystalline silicon sample at the L2,3-edge, with an energy resolution of a few tens of meV. Finally, we combined this spectroscopic method with a pump-probe approach to measure structural and electronic dynamics of a silicon membrane. Tr-XAS/XES data obtained after photoexcitation with an optical laser pulse at 390 nm allowed us to observe perturbations of the band structure, which are compatible with the formation of the predicted precursor state of a non-thermal solid-liquid phase transition associated with a bond softening phenomenon.

Data transfer can, however, be compromised by interference. Conventional techniques for mitigating interference require additional space and power not generally available in handheld mobile devices. Here, we propose a photonic mmWave MIMO receiver architecture capable of interference cancellation with greatly reduced space and power needs. We demonstrate real-time photonic interference cancellation with an integrated FPGA-photonic system that executes a novel zero-calibration micro-ring resonator control algorithm. The system achieves sub-second cancellation weight determination latency with sub-Nyquist sampling. We evaluate the impact of canceller design parameters on performance, establishing that effective photonic cancellation is possible in handheld devices with less than 30 ms weight determination latency.

    "abstract": "Indistinguishable photons are a key resource for many optical quantum technologies. Efficient, on-demand single photon sources have been demonstrated using single solid-state quantum emitters, typically epitaxially grown quantum dots in III-V semiconductors. To achieve the highest performance, these sources are typically operated at liquid helium temperatures ($\\sim 4~\\mathrm{K}$), introducing significant significant size, weight and power (SWAP) considerations that are often impractical for emerging applications such as satelite quantum communications. Here we experimentally verify that coupling a solid-state emitter to a photonic nanocavity can greatly improve photon coherence at higher temperatures where SWAP requirements can be much lower. Using a theoretical model that fully captures the phonon-mediated processes that compromise photon indistinguishability as temperature increases, we reproduce our experimental results and demonstrate the potential to further increase the operating temperature in future generations of optimised devices.
