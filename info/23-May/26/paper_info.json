    "abstract": "Quasi-isentropic compression is an effective method to achieve high-density and high-temperature implosion in laser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF). However, it requires precise matching between the laser profile and the target structure. Designing the optimal laser profile and the corresponding target for ICF is a challenge due to the large number of parameters involved. In this paper, we present a novel method that combines random walk and Bayesian optimization. The basic sampling data for Bayesian optimization are a series of laser pulse profiles and target structures that can produce relatively high areal densities obtained by the random walk method. This approach reduces the number of samples required for Bayesian optimization and mitigates low efficiency in the latter stages of the random walk method. The method also reduces the randomness in the optimization process and enhances the optimization efficiency. It should have important applications in ICF research. ",

    "title": "Study of Synchronous RF Pulsing in Dual Frequency Capacitively Coupled  Plasma",
    "abstract": "Low-pressure multi-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas are used for numerous etch and deposition applications in the semiconductor industry. Pulsing of the radio-frequency (RF) sources enables control of neutral and charged species in the plasma on a millisecond timescale. The synchronous (i.e., simultaneous, in-phase) pulsing of both power sources in a dual frequency capacitively coupled plasma is examined in this article. Due to the low gas pressure, modeling has been done using the electrostatic Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method. The objective of this work is to investigate the sensitivity of the plasma properties to small changes in timing during synchronous pulsing of the 2 RF sources. It is demonstrated that small deviations in the on and off times of the 2 RF sources can lead to major changes in the plasma characteristics. This high sensitivity is of concern for process repeatability but can be utilized to enable better control of the dynamics of plasma-surface interaction. In the simulations, the pulsing parameters (on and off times and ramp rates) are varied and the temporal evolution of plasma characteristics such as electron density (ne), species current at the electrode, and electron temperature are examined. It is demonstrated that if the low-frequency (LF) source is turned off a few {\\mu}s before (or after) the high-frequency source, ne during the off-state is significantly higher (or lower) due to the frequency coupling effect. Similarly, turning on the LF source with a small delay results in a sharp increase in the plasma density when the RF sources are turned on. ",

Here we measured thermal conductivity of ice under pressure up to 50 GPa and found it to increase with pressure until 20 GPa but decrease at higher pressures. We attribute this anomalous drop of thermal conductivity to the collective tunneling of protons at high pressures, supported by large-scale quantum molecular dynamics simulations. The collective tunneling loops span several picoseconds in time and are as large as nanometers in space, which match the phonon periods and wavelengths, leading to strong phonon scattering at high pressures. Our results show direct evidence of collective quantum motion existing in high-pressure ice and provide a new perspective to understanding the coupling between phonon propagation and atomic tunneling.

    "abstract": "Conventional ultraviolet (UV) lamps for disinfection emit radiation in the 255-270 nm range, which poses a high risk of causing cancer and cataracts. To address these concerns, solid-state far UV-C sources emitting below 240 nm are gaining attention as a safe and sustainable disinfection solution for occupied spaces. Here, we delve into the extension of the AlxGa1-xN/AlN quantum dot (QD) technology towards the far UV-C range, which presents various challenges associated with the reduction of the lattice mismatch and band offset when Al is incorporated in the QDs. We explore the structural and optical impact of increasing the Al content through the increase of the Al flux and eventual correction of the Ga flux to maintain a constant metal/N ratio. We also examine the impact of extreme miniaturization of the QDs, achieved through a reduction of their growth time, on the spectral behavior and internal quantum efficiency (IQE). The high Al content results in QDs with a reduced aspect ratio (height/diameter) and thicker wetting layer when compared to the GaN/AlN system. Self-assembled QDs grown with a metal/N ratio ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 show an IQE around 50%, independent of the Al content (up to 65%) or emission wavelength (300-230 nm). However, samples emitting at wavelengths below 270 nm exhibit a bimodal luminescence associated with inhomogeneous in-plane emission attributed to fluctuations of the QD shape associated with extended defects. Reducing the QD size exacerbates the bimodality without reducing the emission wavelength. The power efficiencies under electron beam pumping range from 0.4% to 1%, with clear potential for improvement through surface treatments that enhance light extraction efficiency. ",

The Xe spin polarization is sensed by an in-situ Rb-magnetometer. The Rb-magnetometer works in a parametric oscillation mode (henceforth referred to as the Rb parametric magnetometer, or Rb-PM), in which the Larmor frequency of the Rb spins is modulated and the transverse components of Xe nuclear spin polarization are measured. As the measurement output of the Rb-PM, the phase of the Xe nuclear spin precession is eventually converted to the Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) frequencies and the inertial rotation rate. Here we provide a comprehensive study of the NMR phase measured by the Rb-PM, and analyze the influence of various control parameters, including the DC magnetic field, the frequency and phase of the modulation field, and the Rb resonance linewidth, on the stability of the NMR phase. Based on these analysis, we propose and implement a self-calibrating method to compensate the NMR phase drift during the Rb-PM measurement. With the self-calibrating Rb-PM, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bias stability of NMRG. ",

The kinetic model combined with the linear analysis of the perturbation reveals that the cathode sheath (axial) electric field $E_z$ triggers the gradient drift instability (GDI), deforming the local potential until the instability condition is not fulfilled and the fluctuation growth stops in which moment the instability becomes saturated. The potential deformation consequently leads to the formation of the potential hump, surrounding which the azimuthal electric field $E_y$ is present. The saturation level of $E_y$ is found to be synchronized with and proportional to the time-changing voltage applied at the cathode, resulting in the RF-modulation of the electron heating in the $E_y$ due to $\\nabla B$ drift. In the instability saturated stage, it is shown that the rotation velocity and direction of the spoke present in the simulations agree well with the experimental observation. In the instability linear stage, the instability mode wavelength and the growth rate are also found to be in good agreement with the prediction of the GDI linear fluid theory. ",

High speed switching enables non-deterministic photon sources and logic gates to be made deterministic, while the speed with which quantum light sources can be turned on and off impacts the clock rate of photonic computers and the data rate of quantum communication. Here we use lossy carrier depletion modulators in a silicon waveguide nonlinear interferometer to modulate photon pair generation at 1~GHz without exposing the generated photons to the phase dependent parasitic loss of the modulators. The super sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers reduces power consumption compared to modulating the driving laser.

For two species of emitters in an alternating arrangement, the single excitation sector exhibits non-Hermitian spectral singularities known as exceptional points. We unveil an unconventional phase transition, dubbed exceptional-point phase transition, from the collective to individual spontaneous emission behaviors. At the transition point, the $N \\times N$ Hamiltonian fragments into $N/2-1$ many two-dimensional non-diagonalizable blocks. The remaining diagonalizable block contains a dissipation-induced edge state with algebraically localized profiles, and we provide numerical evidence for its existence in the infinite-array limit. We demonstrate that the edge state can be eliminated via a continuous deformation, consistent with the ill-definedness of bulk topological invariant.
