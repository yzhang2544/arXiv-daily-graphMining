    "abstract": "Ring Polymer Surface-Hopping (RPSH) has been recently introduced as a well-tailored method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), such as zero-point energy and tunneling, into non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. The practical widespread usage of RPSH demands a comprehensive benchmarking of different reaction regimes and conditions with equal emphasis on demonstrating both the cons and pros of the method. Here, we investigate the fundamental questions related to the conservation of energy and detailed balance in the context of RPSH. Using Tully's avoided crossing model as well as a 2-level system coupled to a classical bath undergoing Langevin dynamics, we probe the critical problem of the proper treatment of the classically forbidden transitions stemming from the surface hopping algorithm. We show that proper treatment of these frustrated hops is key to the accurate description of real-time dynamics as well as reproducing the exact quantum Boltzmann population. ",

Here, we report the direct observation of acoustic vibrational modes in a picoliter-scale droplet, extending up to ~ 40 MHz. This was achieved by coupling the droplet to an ultra-sensitive optomechanical sensor, which operates in a thermal-noise limited regime and with a substantial contribution from acoustic noise in the ambient medium. The droplet vibrational modes manifest as Fano resonances in the thermal noise spectrum of the sensor. This is amongst the few reported observations of droplet acoustic modes, and of Fano interactions in a coupled mechanical oscillator system driven only by thermal Brownian motion. ",

However, single-ion conducting electrolytes offer a promising alternative by mitigating overpotential at the electrode and, thus, increasing the device's lifespan. In a recent study, Guzman-Gonzalez et al. (Adv. Energy Mater., 2022, 2202974) presented a novel approach to designing a new class of lithium ionic liquids, based on tetracoordinated boron atom with oligoethylene glycol groups and different fluorinated electron-withdrawing groups. To gain insights into the structural and dynamic aspects underlying the high ionic conductivity of these electrolytes, molecular dynamics simulations were employed. Our results establish a relationship between the variation in ionic conductivity and the extent of uncorrelated motion among the counterions. This phenomenon was explained by differences in the rate of ion coordination dynamics. ",

A suspended GaAs photonic crystal mirror is acting as a highly reflective mechanical resonator, which together with a distributed Bragg reflector forms an optomechanical microcavity. We demonstrate precise control over the microcavity resonance by change of the photonic crystal parameters. The interplay between the microcavity mode and a guided resonance of the photonic crystal modifies the cavity response and results in a stronger dynamical backaction on the mechanical resonator compared to conventional optomechanical dynamics.

We demonstrate a miniaturized optical frequency division system that can potentially transfer the approach to a CMOS-compatible integrated photonic platform. Phase stability is provided by a large-mode-volume, planar-waveguide-based optical reference coil cavity and is divided down from optical to mmWave frequency by using soliton microcombs generated in a waveguide-coupled microresonator.

However, the vibrational spectra of mesoscopic particles - including most biological cells - have remained hidden from existing technologies. These particles are expected to vibrate faintly at megahertz to gigahertz rates, imposing unpractical sensitivity and resolution for current optical and piezoelectric spectroscopy. Here we demonstrate the real-time measurement of natural vibrations of single mesoscopic particles using an optical microresonator, extending the reach of vibrational spectroscopy to a new spectral window. Conceptually, a spectrum of vibrational modes of the particles is stimulated photoacoustically, and correlated to a high-quality-factor optical resonance for the ultrasensitive readout. Experimentally, this scheme is testified by measuring mesoscopic particles with different constituents, sizes, and internal structures, showing an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio of 50 dB and detection bandwidth over 1 GHz. This new technology is further applied for the biomechanical fingerprinting of single microbial cells with different species and living states. The present method opens up new avenues to study single-particle mechanical properties in vibrational degrees of freedom, and may find applications in photoacoustic sensing and imaging, cavity optomechanics and biomechanics.

The small size of flakes makes the experimental characterization of their dielectric properties unsuitable with conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry, due to beam-sample size mismatch and non-uniformities of the crystal axes. Previously, the experimental measurement of the dielectrirc permittivity of such microcrystals was carried out with near-field tip-based scanning probes. These measurements are sensitive to external conditions like vibrations and temperature, and require non-deterministic numerical fitting to some a priori known model. We present an alternative method to extract the in-plane dielectric permittivity of van der Waals microcrystals, based on identifying reflectance minima in spectroscopic measurements. Our method does not require complex fitting algorithms nor near field tip-based measurements and accommodates for small-area samples. We demonstrate the robustness of our method using hexagonal boron nitride and {\\alpha}-MoO3, and recover their dielectric permittivities that are close to literature values. ",

    "abstract": "Source footprints represent an inherent problem to full-waveform inversion (FWI). They are caused by the high data sensitivity to the model parameters in the vicinity of the seismic sources and can be exacerbated by source-related errors in the modeling operator. We propose a simple, effective, and efficient method to remove source footprints in FWI when sources are located near or inside the volume of interest while robustly updating the model in their vicinity. The method uses illumination redundancy and extends the model along sources. Each source updates one component of the extended model, and a regularization term ensures that these components are mutually consistent, except for their respective footprints. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on the elastic inversion of synthetic guided waves. We show its robustness in the presence of source-related errors and its superiority over other well-known approaches, such as illumination compensation by inverse pseudo-Hessian and gradient preconditioning. We apply the method to a field distributed acoustic sensing dataset with elastic guided waves generated by perforation shots in an unconventional shale reservoir. The method is able to retrieve localized reservoir anomalies with higher elastic velocities, indicating possible lower pore pressure or tighter shale regions. ",

The ability to selectively modulate electromagnetic waves through electrical stimuli is crucial in the advancement of a variety of applications from data communication and computing devices to environmental science and space explorations. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) are one of the most promising material candidates for reconfigurable photonics due to their large optical contrast between their different solid-state structural phases. Although significant efforts have been devoted to accurate simulation of PCM-based devices, in this paper, we highlight three important aspects which have often evaded prior models yet having significant impacts on the thermal and phase transition behavior of these devices: the enthalpy of fusion, the heat capacity change upon glass transition, as well as the thermal conductivity of liquid-phase PCMs. We further investigated the important topic of switching energy scaling in PCM devices, which also helps explain why the three above-mentioned effects have long been overlooked in electronic PCM memories but only become important in photonics. Our findings offer insight to facilitate accurate modeling of PCM-based photonic devices and can inform the development of more efficient reconfigurable optics. ",

    "abstract": "As we rapidly advance through the information age, the power consumed by computers, data centers, and networks grows exponentially. This has inspired a race to develop alternative low-power computational technologies. A new adiabatic configuration of a decades-old superconducting digital logic device has darted into the lead called quantum flux parametrons (QFP). QFP operate with dissipation so low that they seemingly violate the laws of thermodynamics. In just a short span of time, they have gone from simple single NOT gates to complex processors containing thousands of gates. They are fabricated from elemental niobium superconductors cooled to just a few degrees above absolute zero. However, their efficiency is so great that for large high-performance computers with several gates, the energy savings are immense. For smaller computational platforms QFPs from high-temperature superconductors (high-Tc) are highly desirable. In this work, we take the first steps towards this goal with the demonstration of a high-T C QFP shift register. Our device is fabricated using focused helium ion beam lithography where the material is modified with an ion beam at the nanoscale to directly pattern these circuits into a high-T C thin film. We validate the correct logical operation at 25 K, over 6 times higher than niobium devices with an estimated bit energy of 0.1 attoJoule at 10 GHz. ",

Recently, programmable silicon photonics has also found new applications in quantum2 and classical 3 information processing. A key component of programmable silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is the phase shifter, traditionally realized via the thermo-optic or plasma dispersion effect which are weak, volatile, and power hungry. A non-volatile phase shifter can circumvent these limitations by requiring zero power to maintain the switched phases. Previously non-volatile phase modulation was achieved via phase-change4 or ferroelectric materials5, but the switching energy remains high (pico to nano joules) and the speed is slow (micro to milli seconds). Here, we report a non-volatile III-V-on-silicon photonic phase shifter based on HfO2 memristor with sub-pJ switching energy (~400fJ), representing over an order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to the state of the art. The non-volatile phase shifter can be switched reversibly using a single 100ns pulse and exhibits an excellent endurance over 800 cycles. This technology can enable future energy-efficient programmable PICs for data centers, optical neural networks, and quantum information processing. ",

    "abstract": "We analyze the accuracy and sample complexity of variational Monte Carlo approaches to simulate the dynamics of many-body quantum systems classically. By systematically studying the relevant stochastic estimators, we are able to: (i) prove that the most used scheme, the time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (tVMC), is affected by a systematic statistical bias or exponential sample complexity when the wave function contains some (possibly approximate) zeros, an important case for fermionic systems and quantum information protocols; (ii) show that a different scheme based on the solution of an optimization problem at each time step is free from such problems; (iii) improve the sample complexity of this latter approach by several orders of magnitude with respect to previous proofs of concept. Finally, we apply our advancements to study the high-entanglement phase in a protocol of non-Clifford unitary dynamics with local random measurements in 2D, first benchmarking on small spin lattices and then extending to large systems.
