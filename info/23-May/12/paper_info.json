    "abstract": "The two-color laser field scheme for broad-band terahertz (THz) radiation from air has been intensively and broadly investigated due to the simplicity in technology and relative high yield efficiency. Experiments showed that the detected THz angular distribution is usually conical with a dip in the laser propagation axis which is unfavorable for its application, and the formation of an oscillating tail in the THz waveform has not yet been well understood. Here, we develop an electric field element interference model in which each local current source has a phase velocity determined by the laser pulse and a Gaussian temporal profile, rather than an ideal point source, as well as the current oscillation caused by the plasma dynamics is considered. By introducing the temporal interference, effects of the phase velocity and the Gaussian profile of the current can correct the THz angular distribution. Therefore, by adjusting the laser pulse duration and the group velocity, the THz angular distribution can be controlled and the dip could be even eliminated. Besides, the plasma dynamics can result in the formation of an oscillating tail in the THz waveform and sunken spikes in the corresponding spectrum. This is similar to the experimental results which are usually explained by the water vapor absorption. In turn, the spikes in the spectrum could provide a way to measure the plasma filament density.

In particular, we discuss the nature of the reference Hamiltonian and the first-order interacting space. This is followed by some detailed discussion with respect to the intruder state problem and various shift techniques to address this problem. Afterwards a longer review on alternative reference Hamiltonians, which to some degree or completely remove the intruder state problem, is put forward. Subsequently the presently proposed multi-state versions of the CASPT2 method are discussed in some detail.

With the development of deep learning, applying it to high-precision inertial sensors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio is a practically meaningful task. Since there is a single noise sample and unknown true value in the measured data in orbit, odd-even sub-samplers and periodic sub-samplers are designed to process general signals and periodic signals, and adds reconstruction layers consisting of fully connected layers to the model. Experimental analysis and comparison are conducted based on simulation data, GRACE-FO acceleration data and Taiji-1 acceleration data.

To beat dephasing, ultrafast energy transfer is achieved by coupling single emitters to a plasmonic nanoresonator with an extremely small mode volume and optimal spectral overlap. Typically, normal mode splittings in luminescence spectra of single-emitter strongly-coupled systems are provided as evidence for strong coupling and to obtain rough estimates of the light-matter coupling strength g. However, a complete anticrossing of a single emitter and a cavity mode as well as the characterization of the uncoupled constituents is usually hard to achieve. Here, we exploit the light-induced oxygen-dependent blue-shift of individual CdSe/ZnS semiconductor quantum dots to tune their transition energy across the resonance of a scanning plasmonic slit resonator after characterizing both single emitter and nano resonator in their uncoupled states. Our results provide clear proof of single-emitter strong light-matter coupling at ambient condition as well as a value for the Rabi splitting at zero detuning 100 meV, consistent with modeling, thereby opening the path towards plexitonic devices that exploit single-photon nonlinearities at ambient conditions.

In this context a less explored phenomenon is self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR). Unlike CR, SISR may arise away from the bifurcation threshold and the properties of the induced oscillations depend upon both the noise intensity and the time-scale separation factor. In this work, we report a new chimera pattern in a network of coupled excitable units, namely the self-induced stochastic resonance chimera or SISR-chimera that originates from the SISR phenomenon. We explore the detailed dynamics of the SISR-chimera in the parameter space using proper quantitative measures. We have found that unlike CR chimera, the SISR-chimera pattern strongly depends upon the ratio of time scale and noise intensity. Therefore, this type of chimera pattern can be induced even for a tiny noise intensity if the time scale separation of the activator and inhibitor is large enough. ",

We experimentally realize an optical phase shift of $0.19 \\pi \\pm 0.03$ radians ($\\approx 34$ degrees) using a weak coherent state interacting with a single quantum dot in a planar nanophotonic waveguide. The phase shift is probed by interferometric measurements of the light scattered from the quantum dot in the waveguide.

They are difficult to probe experimentally due to the high reactivity and low melting point of lithium as well as the microscopic scales at which lithium exists in batteries where it is found to have enhanced strength, with implications for dendrite suppression strategies. Computationally, there is a lack of empirical potentials that are consistently quantitatively accurate across all properties and ab-initio calculations are too costly. In this work, we train Machine Learning Interaction Potentials (MLIPs) on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to state-of-the-art accuracy in reproducing experimental and ab-initio results across a wide range of simulations at large length and time scales. We accurately predict thermodynamic properties, phonon spectra, temperature dependence of elastic constants and various surface properties inaccessible using DFT.

    "abstract": "A dimerized chain of dipolar emitters strongly coupled to a multimode optical cavity is studied. By integrating out the photonic degrees of freedom of the cavity, the system is recast in a two-band model with an effective long-range coupling, so that it mimicks a variation of the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which features a nontrivial topological phase and hosts topological edge states. In the strong-coupling regime, the cavity photons hybridize the bright dipolar bulk band into a polaritonic one, renormalizing the eigenspectrum and strongly breaking chiral symmetry. This leads to a formal loss of the in-gap edge states present in the topological phase while they merge into the polaritonic bulk band. Interestingly, however, we find that bulk polaritons entering in resonance with the edge states inherit part of their localization properties, so that multiple polaritonic edge states are observed. Although these states are not fully localized on the edges, they present unusual properties. In particular, due to their delocalized bulk part, owing from their polaritonic nature, such edge states exhibit efficient transport characteristics. Instead of being degenerate, they occupy a large portion of the spectrum, allowing one to probe them in a wide driving frequency range. Moreover, being reminiscent of symmetry-protected topological edge states, they feature a strong tolerance to off-diagonal disorder. ",

In the proposed bilinearization we make use of an auxiliary function to convert the trilinear equations into a set of bilinear equations. We obtain bright 1-soliton, 2- soliton solutions and present the scheme for obtaining N soliton solution. In the soliton solution the presence of an additional parameter allows tuning the position of soliton. We find that the proposed scheme of bilinearization using auxiliary function, considerably simplifies the procedure yet generates a more general solution than the one reported earlier. We show that the obtained soliton solution reduces to an algebraic soliton in the limit of infinite width. Further we show explicitly that the soliton interactions are elastic through asymptotic analysis, that is the amplitude of each soliton remains same before and after interaction. The mark of interaction is left behind only in the phase of each soliton. Secondly, we propose a generalised Lax pair for the FLE and obtain the conserved quantities by solving Riccati equation. We believe that the present investigation would be useful to study the applications of FLE in nonlinear optics and other branches of physics. ",

To this end, we exploit a high-order tensor factorization and block encoding technique that efficiently represents each SAPT observable. To quantify the computational cost of our methodology, we provide resource estimates in terms of the required number of logical qubits and Toffoli gates to execute our algorithm for a range of benchmark molecules, also taking into account the cost of the eigenstate preparation and the cost of block encoding the SAPT observables.
