    "abstract": "Introduction: Wrist instability remains a common health concern. The potential of dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in assessing carpal dynamics associated with this condition is a field of ongoing research. This study contributes to this line of inquiry by developing MRI-derived carpal kinematic metrics and investigating their stability. Methods: A previously described 4D MRI approach for tracking the movements of carpal bones in the wrist was deployed in this study. A panel of 120 metrics characterizing radial/ulnar deviation and flexion extension movements was constructed by fitting low order polynomial models of scaphoid and lunate degrees of freedom against that of the capitate. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were utilized to analyze intra- and inter-subject stability within a mixed cohort of 49 subjects, including 20 with and 29 without a history of wrist injury. Results: A comparable degree of stability across the two different wrist movements. Out of the total 120 derived metrics, distinct subsets demonstrated high stability within each type of movement. Among asymptomatic subjects, 16 out of 17 metrics with high intra-subject stability also showed high inter-subject stability. Interestingly, some quadratic term metrics, although relatively unstable within asymptomatic subjects, showed increased stability within this group, hinting at potential differentiation in their behavior across different cohorts. Conclusion: This study showed the developing potential of dynamic MRI to characterize complex carpal bone dynamics. Stability analyses of the derived kinematic metrics showed encouraging differences between cohorts with and without a history of wrist injury. Although these broad metric stability variations highlight the potential utility of this approach for analysis of carpal instability, further studies are necessary to better characterize these observations.

In contrast to the standard area theorem, which is valid for a single pass of a traveling pulse through a resonant medium, the obtained generalized area theorem takes into account the medium-assisted nonlinear self-action effects through the medium excitation left by the pulse at the previous round-trip in the cavity. The generalized area theorem was then applied to the theoretical description of the dynamics of a single-section ring-cavity laser and the steady solutions for the pulse area and for the medium parameters were found both in the limit of a lumped model and for a spatially-extended system. The derived area theorem can be used for the convenient analytical description of different coherent photonic devices, like coherently mode-locked lasers or pulse compressors, as well as for the analysis of the photon echo formation in cavity-based setups.

The `reaction coordinates' for ultrafast SEF even in archetypal systems such as pentacene thin film remain unclear with synthetic design principles broadly relying on tailoring electronic couplings to achieve new templates for efficient SEF materials. Spectroscopic detection of vibrational coherences in the (TT)1 photoproduct has motivated theoretical investigations into a possible role of vibronic resonance in driving SEF, akin to that reported in several photosynthetic proteins. However, a precise understanding of how prominent low-frequency vibrations and their modulation of intermolecular orbital overlaps, equally prominent high-frequency vibrations, and order of magnitude larger Huang-Rhys factors in SEF chromophores compared to photosynthetic pigments, collectively influence the mechanistic details of SEF remains starkly lacking. Here we address this gap and identify previously unrecognized effects which are quite contrasting from those known in photosynthesis excitons, and vitally enhance non-adiabatic internal conversion in SEF. Our findings have direct implications for the broad experimental interest in synthetically tailoring molecules to promote vibronically enhanced internal conversion. ",

High output pulse quality and a guided peak intensity of 3 PW/cm2 were achieved by suppressing plasma effects in the residual gas by pre-pumping the fiber after evacuation. This appears to cause a long-term removal of molecules from the fiber core. Identifying the fluence at the fiber core-wall interface as the damage origin, we scaled the coupled energy to 1.8 mJ using a short piece of larger-core fiber to obtain 20 GW at the fiber output. This scheme can pave the way towards the integration of anti-resonant fibers in mJ-level nonlinear optical experiments and laser-source development. ",

However, the origin of this fascinating phenomenon has so far remained mostly unexplained. We therefore propose an exhaustive discussion that provides a clear and rigorous explanation for the existence of such a torque. Using multipolar theory, and taking into account nonlocal interactions, we find that this torque stems from multipolar pseudochiral responses that generate both spin and orbital angular momenta. We also show that the nature of these peculiar responses makes them particularly dependent on the asymmetry of the particles. By elucidating the origin of this type of torque, this work may prove instrumental for the design of high-performance nano-rotors. ",

This is achieved by making use of two spatial harmonics for radiation. The unit cell of the periodic microstrip antenna contains three meanders with mitred corners. To ensure circular polarization, a theoretical formulation is developed taking into account the delay caused by microstrip length intervals. It defines the unit cell geometry by determining the length of the meanders to ensure that axial ratio remains below 3 dB throughout the operational band. Moreover, the meanders are used to provide better control over scanning rate (the ratio of change of angle of maximum radiation with frequency) and reduce spurious radiation of harmonics by ensuring single harmonic operation within the operational band. To guarantee continuous scanning through broadside direction, open stopband is suppressed using mitered angles. The antenna is designed on a 0.254-mm substrate making it suitable for conformal applications. The fabricated antenna shows a backward to forward beam steering range of 72 deg (-42 deg to 30 deg) in the K-band (19.4-27.5 GHz) with circular polarization and of 75 deg (-15 deg to 60 deg) in the Ku-band (11-15.5 GHz) with linear polarization.

For chromophores in the condensed phase, the large number of atoms needed to simulate the environment has traditionally prohibited the use of high-level excited-state electronic structure methods. By leveraging transfer learning, we show how to construct machine-learned models to accurately predict high-level excitation energies of a chromophore in solution from only 400 high-level calculations. We show that when the electronic excitations of the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water are treated using EOM-CCSD embedded in a DFT description of the solvent, the optical spectrum is correctly captured and that this improvement arises from correctly treating the coupling of the electronic transition to electric fields, which leads to a larger response upon hydrogen bonding between the chromophore and water.

The bunch-length dependent signal of a BCM results from the detection and integration - over a given frequency band - of the temporal coherent enhancement of the radiation spectral energy emitted by the electron beam while experiencing a longitudinal compression. In this letter, we present a method that permits to express the relative variation of the bunch length as a function of the relative statistical fluctuations of the BCM signal and charge. Furthermore, in the case of a BCM equipped with two detectors simultaneously operating in two distinct wavelength bands, the method permits an absolute determination of the bunch length. The presented method is beneficial to a FEL since it permits to tune the machine compression feedback with respect to the measured bunch length instead of the bunch-length dependent signal. In a CW-linac driven FEL, it can offer the precious opportunity to implement a fully non-invasive and absolute diagnostics of the bunch length. ",

Additionally, a radial potential term, dependent on the average radius of the ring, is introduced. The analysis is restricted to motion in a two-dimensional plane, neglecting the degree of freedom in the $z$-direction. By solving the radial equation, we determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, allowing for an explicit expression of the energy. The probability distribution is analyzed for varying rotating parameter values, revealing a shift of the distribution as the rotation changes, resulting in a centrifugal effect and occupation of the ring's edges. Furthermore, numerical analysis demonstrates the significant rotational effects on energy levels and optical properties, including optical absorption and refractive coefficients. ",

Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) method has been used to quantify the uncertainty of PMPs from a Bayesian perspective. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical Bayesian model for IUQ which aims to mitigate two existing challenges: the high variability of PMPs under varying experimental conditions, and unknown model discrepancies or outliers causing over-fitting issues for the PMPs. The proposed hierarchical model is compared with the conventional single-level Bayesian model based on the PMPs in TRACE using the measured void fraction data in the Boiling Water Reactor Full-size Fine-mesh Bundle Test (BFBT) benchmark. A Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Method - No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is used for posterior sampling in the hierarchical structure. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical structure in providing better estimates of the posterior distributions of PMPs and being less prone to over-fitting. The proposed hierarchical model also demonstrates a promising approach for generalizing IUQ to larger databases with a broad range of experimental conditions and different geometric setups. ",

One of the most important gates is the controlled-NOT, which is widely used to prepare two-qubit entangled states. The controlled-NOT gate for single photon qubits is normally realized as a six-mode network of individual beamsplitters. This architecture however, utilizes only a small fraction of the circuit for the quantum operation with the majority of the footprint dedicated to routing waveguides. Quantum walks are an alternative photonics platform that use arrays of coupled waveguides with a continuous interaction region instead of discrete gates. While quantum walks have been successful for investigating condensed matter physics, applying the multi-mode interference for logical quantum operations is yet to be shown. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a two-qubit controlled-NOT gate in an array of lithium niobate-on-insulator waveguides. We engineer the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the six evanescently-coupled single-mode waveguides such that the multi-mode interference corresponds to the linear optical controlled-NOT unitary. We measure the two-qubit transfer matrix with $0.938\\pm0.003$ fidelity, and we use the gate to generate entangled qubits with $0.945\\pm0.002$ fidelity by preparing the control photon in a superposition state.

We outline this approach explicitly in the Fock basis, relevant in particular for Boson sampling, where the simulation time (space) complexity for computing output amplitudes, to arbitrary accuracy, scales as $O(m^2 2^n)$ ($O(m2^n)$), for $n$ photons distributed amongst $m$ modes. We additionally demonstrate linear optical simulations with the $n$ photons initially in the same mode scales efficiently, as $O(m^2 n)$. This paradigm provides a practical notion of `non-classicality', i.e., the classical resources required for simulation, which by making connections to the stellar formalism, we show this comes from two independent contributions, the number of single-photon additions, and the amount of squeezing.
