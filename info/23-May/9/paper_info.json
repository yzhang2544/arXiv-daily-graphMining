    "abstract": "Microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) is a near-field imaging technique that has been used to visualize the local conductivity of materials with nanoscale resolution across the GHz regime. In recent years, MIM has shown great promise for the investigation of topological states of matter, correlated electronic states and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. To explore these low-energy phenomena, many of which are only detectable in the milliKelvin regime, we have developed a novel low-temperature MIM incorporated into a dilution refrigerator. This setup which consists of a tuning-fork-based atomic force microscope with microwave reflectometry capabilities, is capable of reaching temperatures down to 70 mK during imaging and magnetic fields up to 9 T. To test the performance of this microscope, we demonstrate microwave imaging of the conductivity contrast between graphite and silicon dioxide at cryogenic temperatures and discuss the resolution and noise observed in these results. We extend this methodology to visualize edge conduction in Dirac semimetal cadmium arsenide in the quantum Hall regime ",

    "abstract": "Periodic nanoparticle arrays can support surface lattice resonances (SLRs), which arise from the hybridization between localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and diffractive Rayleigh anomalies (RAs). In contrast to LSPs, SLRs enjoy a much higher quality (Q) factor. As the Q factor depends on many system parameters, a good understanding of them is essential for optimization. Here, we study the dependence of the Q factor of SLR from 2D Au nanorod arrays on nanorod orientation. It is found the Q factor is 112 when the nanorod is lying perpendicular to the incident plane but gradually increases by more than 13 times to 1460 upon rotating it azimuthally. The increase of the Q factor is due to the interplay between the coupling strength and the frequency detuning between the LSP and RA as well as the decay rate of the LSP. By optimizing these parameters, we can achieve a Q factor reaching over 12000, which is 6 times higher than the best reported so far. ",

This article presents a plasma synthesis approach for the fabrication of piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and self-powered sensors on paper substrates. Polycrystalline ZnO nanocolumnar thin films are deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition on common paper supports using a microwave electron cyclotron resonance reactor working at room temperature yielding high growth rates and low structural and interfacial stresses. Applying Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, we elucidate the basic shadowing mechanism behind the characteristic microstructure and porosity of the ZnO thin films, relating them to an enhanced piezoelectric response to periodic and random inputs. The piezoelectric devices are assembled by embedding the ZnO films in PMMA and using Au electrodes in two different configurations: laterally and vertically contacted devices. We present the response of the laterally connected devices as a force sensor for low-frequency events with different answers to the applied force depending on the impedance circuit, i.e. load values range, a behaviour that is theoretically analyzed. The vertical devices reach power densities as high as 0.27 microW/cm2. We analyze their actual-scenario performance by activation with a fan and handwriting. Overall, this work demonstrates the advantages of implementing plasma deposition for piezoelectric films to develop robust, flexible, stretchable, and enhanced-performance nanogenerators and self-powered piezoelectric sensors compatible with inexpensive and recyclable supports ",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems with their spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs) have been explored for lasing, controlling light transport, and enhancing a sensor s response. A ring resonator can be brought to an EP by controlling the coupling between its frequency degenerate clockwise and counterclockwise traveling modes. This has been typically achieved by introducing two or more nanotips into the resonator s mode volume. While this method provides a route to study EP physics, the basic understanding of how the nanotips shape and size symmetry impact the system s non-Hermicity is missing, along with additional loss from both in-plane and out-of-plane scattering. The limited resonance stability poses a challenge for leveraging EP effects for switches or modulators, which requires stable cavity resonance and fixed laser-cavity detuning. Here we use lithographically defined asymmetric and symmetric Mie scatterers, which enable subwavelength control of wave transmission and reflections without deflecting to additional radiation channels. We show that those pre-defined Mie scatterers can bring the system to an EP without post tuning, as well as enable chiral light transport within the resonator. Counterintuitively, the Mie scatterer results in enhanced quality factor measured on the transmission port, through coherently suppressing the backscattering from the waveguide surface roughness. The proposed device platform enables pre-defined chiral light propagation and backscattering-free resonances, needed for various applications such as frequency combs, solitons, sensing, and other nonlinear optical processes such as photon blockade, and regenerative oscillators.

As the 2D material composites research studies the statistical average of complex catalytic behaviors, an integrated photonic platform allows clean and single flake level photo-catalytic investigations with precisely quantified photocatalytic activities. In this paper, we track fluence-dependent photo-oxidation in two-dimensional Tellurene (2D Te) by the evanescently coupled micro-resonator. Nearly 32 perent of oxidation is achieved in 10 nm 2D Te flake, compared to only 4.5% oxidation in 30 nm sample, probed by the resonance shift in silicon microring resonators (MRRs) substrate. The wider bandgap in the few layers of 2D Te allows faster charge transfer to adsorbed oxygen for a more efficient photocatalytic redox reaction. The photo-oxidation in hybrid 2D Te results in an invariant lineshapes of optical transmission resonance for wavelength trimming (more than 3 times resonance bandwidth). The low threshold power, near-infrared, and in-waveguide resonance trimming scheme is compatible with most integrated photonic setups for easy fixing the nanofabrication-induced random resonance deviation for integrated photonic circuit applications in wavelength-division-multiplexing systems and spin qubits quantum computing.

In order to avoid noise accumulation from the NISQ device in the circuit, it is adament to keep the so-called quantum depth of the circuit at a minimum, defined as the minimum number of quantum gates that need to be operated sequentially.

Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been proposed (e.g. Quantum Phase Estimation) but the limited capabilities of current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices (NISQ) motivated the development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as an effective method to compute the ground state energy of small molecules. The current study investigates the Folded Spectrum (FS) method as an extension to the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target energy, using the same ansatz as for the ground state calculation. Inspired by the variance-based methods from the Quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS method minimizes the energy variance, thus requiring a computationally expensive squared Hamiltonian. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by employing a Pauli grouping procedure, identifying sets of commuting Pauli strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant reduction of the computational cost. We apply the FS-VQE method to small molecules (H$_2$,LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical accuracy on ideal quantum simulators. ",

A prototypical example of a quasi-particle, a polaron, is an impurity strongly interacting with a surrounding medium. Fermi polarons, created in a Fermi sea, provide a paradigmatic realization of this concept. As an inherent and important property such quasi-particles interact with each other via modulation of the medium. While quantum simulation experiments with ultracold atoms have significantly improved our understanding of individual polarons, the detection of their interactions has remained elusive in these systems. Here, we report the unambiguous observation of mediated interactions between Fermi polarons consisting of K impurities embedded in a Fermi sea of Li atoms. Our results confirm two landmark predictions of Landau's Fermi-liquid theory: the shift of the polaron energy due to mediated interactions, linear in the concentration of impurities, and its sign inversion with impurity quantum statistics. For weak to moderate interactions between the impurities and the medium, we find excellent agreement with the static (zero-momentum and energy) predictions of Fermi-liquid theory. For stronger impurity-medium interactions, we show that the observed behaviour at negative energies can be explained by a more refined many-body treatment including retardation and molecule formation ",
