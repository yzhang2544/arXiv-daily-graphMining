    "abstract": "Optically addressable spin defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have emerged as attractable platforms for various quantum technologies. However, the low photon count rate significantly limits their applications. We strongly enhanced the brightness by 7 times and spin-control strength by 14 times of single divacancy defects in 4H-SiC membranes using surface plasmon generated by gold film coplanar waveguides. The mechanism of the plasmonic-enhanced effect is further studied by tuning the distance between single defects and the surface of the gold film. A three-energy-level model is used to determine the corresponding transition rates consistent with the enhanced brightness of single defects. Lifetime measurements also verified the coupling between defects and surface plasmons. Our scheme is low-cost, without complicated microfabrication and delicate structures, which is applicable for other spin defects in different materials. This work would promote developing spin defect-based quantum applications in mature SiC materials. ",

    "abstract": "Convolution is an essential operation in signal and image processing and consumes most of the computing power in convolutional neural networks. Photonic convolution has the promise of addressing computational bottlenecks and outperforming electronic implementations. Performing photonic convolution in the synthetic frequency dimension, which harnesses the dynamics of light in the spectral degrees of freedom for photons, can lead to highly compact devices. Here we experimentally realize convolution operations in the synthetic frequency dimension. Using a modulated ring resonator, we synthesize arbitrary convolution kernels using a pre-determined modulation waveform with high accuracy. We demonstrate the convolution computation between input frequency combs and synthesized kernels. We also introduce the idea of an additive offset to broaden the kinds of kernels that can be implemented experimentally when the modulation strength is limited. Our work demonstrate the use of synthetic frequency dimension to efficiently encode data and implement computation tasks, leading to a compact and scalable photonic computation architecture. ",

    "abstract": "Long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-14 um) photonics is a rapidly growing research field within the mid-IR with applications in molecular spectroscopy and optical free-space communication. LWIR-applications are often addressed using rather bulky tabletop-sized free-space optical systems, preventing advanced photonic applications such as rapid-time-scale experiments. Here, device miniaturization into photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with maintained optical capabilities is key to revolutionize mid-IR photonics. Sub-wavelength mode confinement in plasmonic structures enabled such miniaturization approaches in the visible-to-near-IR spectral range. However, adopting plasmonics for the LWIR needs suitable low-loss and -dispersion materials with compatible integration strategies to existing mid-IR technology. In this work we further unlock the field of LWIR/mid-IR PICs, by combining photolithographic patterning of organic polymers with dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP) waveguides. In particular, polyethylene shows favorable optical properties, including low refractive index and broad transparency between ~2-200 um. We investigate the whole value chain, including design, fabrication, and characterization of polyethylene-based DLSPP waveguides and demonstrate their first-time plasmonic operation and mode guiding capabilities along s-bend structures. Low bending losses of ~1.3 dB and straight-section propagation lengths of ~1 mm, pave the way for unprecedented, complex on-chip mid-IR photonic devices. Moreover, DLSPPs allow full control of the mode parameters (propagation length and guiding capabilities) for precisely addressing advanced sensing and telecommunication applications with chip-scale devices.

Comparison with measured results available in the literature is carried out for the antenna effective length. The response due to any other feed voltage pulse can be obtained in terms of the impulse response via convolution. Results are presented for a Gaussian and a fast-rising feed voltage pulse.

Among various integrated and non-integrated ONNs, free-space diffractive ONNs benefit from a large number of pixels of spatial light modulators to realize millions of neurons. However, a significant fraction of computation time and energy is consumed by the nonlinear activation function that is typically implemented using a camera sensor. Here, we propose a novel surface-normal photodetector (SNPD) with a nonlinear response to replace the camera sensor that enables about three orders of magnitude faster (5.7 us response time) and more energy efficient (less than 10 nW/pixel) response. Direct efficient vertical optical coupling, polarization insensitivity, inherent nonlinearity with no control electronics, low optical power requirements, and the possibility of implementing large scale arrays make the SNPD a promising nonlinear activation function for diffractive ONNs. To show the applicability, successful classification simulation of MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using the measured response of SNPD with accuracy comparable to that of an ideal ReLU function are demonstrated.

When connected to a topological invariant, the propagation of light remains unchanged in the presence of disorder. However, a general challenge remains to directly characterise the topological properties of systems by experiment. In this work, we demonstrate a novel technique for directly observing a photonic winding number using a single measurement. By propagating light with a sufficiently broad spectrum along a topological photonic crystal fibre, we calculate the winding number invariant from the output intensity pattern. We quantify the limitations of this single-shot method, which works even for surprisingly narrow and asymmetric spectral distributions. Furthermore, we dynamically evaluate the effectiveness of our method by uncovering the loss of the bulk invariant as we twist the fibre. The characterisation method that we present is highly accessible and transferable across topological photonic platforms. ",

This work demonstrates how $(ZnS)_{0.8}-(SiO_2)_{0.2}$ caps radically influence the performance of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ and Ag-doped $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ integrated photonic devices. We found that at least 30 nm of capping material is necessary to protect the material from Sulfur loss. However, adding this cap affects the crystallization temperatures of the two PCMs in different ways. The crystallization temperature of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ and Ag-doped $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ increased and decreased respectively, which is attributed to interfacial energy differences. Capped and uncapped Ag-doped $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ microring resonator (MRR) devices were fabricated and measured to understand how the cap affects the device performance. Surprisingly, the resonant frequency of the MRR exhibited a larger red-shift upon crystallization for the capped PCMs. This effect was due to the cap increasing the modal overlap with the PCM layer. Caps can, therefore, be used to provide a greater optical phase shift per unit length, thus reducing the overall footprint of these programmable devices. Overall, we conclude that caps on PCMs are not just useful for stabilizing the PCM layer, but can also be used to tune the PCM crystallization temperature and reduce device footprint. Moreover, the capping layer can be exploited to enhance light-matter interactions with the PCM element. ",

Endowing Erbium-based gain in photonic integrated circuits can provide a basis for miniaturizing low-noise fiber lasers to chip-scale form factor, and enable large-volume applications. Yet, while major progress has been made in the last decade on integrated lasers based on silicon photonics with III-V gain media, the integration of Erbium lasers on chip has been compounded by large laser linewidth. Recent advances in photonic integrated circuit-based high-power Erbium-doped amplifiers, make a new class of rare-earth-ion-based lasers possible. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated chip-scale Erbium laser that achieves high power, narrow linewidth, frequency agility, and the integration of a III-V pump laser. The laser circuit is based on an Erbium-implanted ultralow-loss silicon nitride Si$_3$N$4$ photonic integrated circuit. This device achieves single-mode lasing with a free-running intrinsic linewidth of 50 Hz, a relative intensity noise of $<$-150 dBc/Hz at $>$10 MHz offset, and output power up to 17 mW, approaching the performance of fiber lasers and state-of-the-art semiconductor extended cavity lasers. An intra-cavity microring-based Vernier filter enables wavelength tunability of $>$ 40 nm within the C- and L-bands while attaining side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of $>$ 70 dB, surpassing legacy fiber lasers in tuning and SMRS performance. This new class of low-noise, tuneable Erbium waveguide laser could find applications in LiDAR, microwave photonics, optical frequency synthesis, and free-space communications. Our approach is extendable to other wavelengths, and more broadly, constitutes a novel way to photonic integrated circuit-based rare-earth-ion-doped lasers. ",

In our experiments, we release a liquid drop above a deep liquid pool to investigate simultaneously the dynamics of the cavity and the velocity field produced around the air-liquid interface. Using particle image velocimetry, we analyse quantitatively the velocity field using a shifted Legendre polynomial decomposition. We show that the velocity field is more complex than considered in previous models, in relation to the non-hemispherical shape of the crater. In particular, the velocity field is dominated by degrees 0 and 1, with contributions from degree 2, and is independent of the Froude and the Weber numbers when these numbers are large enough. We then derive a semi-analytical model based on the Legendre polynomial expansion of an unsteady Bernoulli equation coupled with a kinematic boundary condition at the crater boundary. This model explains the experimental observations and can predict the time evolution of both the velocity field and the shape of the crater, including the initiation of the central jet. ",

Feed-forward neural networks are one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms due to their simplicity and universal approximation capability. However, the typical training procedure, where all weights are optimized, can be time and energy consuming. An alternative approach is the Extreme Learning Machine, a feed-forward neural network in which only the output weights are trained, while the internal connections are random. Here we present an experimental implementation of a photonic extreme learning machine (PELM) in an integrated silicon chip. The PELM is based on the processing of the image of the scattered light by an array of 18 gratings coupled to microresonators. Light propagation in the microresonator array is a linear process while light detection by the video camera is a nonlinear process. Training is done offline by analyzing the recorded scattered light image with a linear classifier. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of the PELM by solving both binary and analog tasks, and show how the performance depends on the number of microresonators used in the readout procedure.

Rydberg arrays have emerged as a prominent platform in this context with impressive system sizes and proposals suggesting how error-correction thresholds could be significantly improved by detecting leakage errors with single-atom resolution, a form of erasure error conversion. However, two-qubit entanglement fidelities in Rydberg atom arrays have lagged behind competitors and this type of erasure conversion is yet to be realized for matter-based qubits in general. Here we demonstrate both erasure conversion and high-fidelity Bell state generation using a Rydberg quantum simulator. We implement erasure conversion via fast imaging of alkaline-earth atoms, which leaves atoms in a metastable state unperturbed and yields additional information independent of the final qubit readout. When excising data with observed erasure errors, we achieve a lower-bound for the Bell state generation fidelity of ${\\geq} 0.9971^{+10}_{-13}$, which improves to ${\\geq}0.9985^{+7}_{-12}$ when correcting for remaining state preparation errors. We further demonstrate erasure conversion in a quantum simulation experiment for quasi-adiabatic preparation of long-range order across a quantum phase transition, where we explicitly differentiate erasure conversion of preparation and Rydberg decay errors. We unveil the otherwise hidden impact of these errors on the simulation outcome by evaluating correlations between erasures and the final readout as well as between erasures themselves. Our work demonstrates the capability for Rydberg-based entanglement to reach fidelities in the ${\\sim} 0.999$ regime, with higher fidelities a question of technical improvements, and shows how erasure conversion can be utilized in NISQ devices.
