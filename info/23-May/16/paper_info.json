    "abstract": "Transition metal complexes for photochemical applications often feature a high density of electron-vibrational states characterized by nonadiabatic and spin-orbit couplings. Overall, the dynamics after photoexcitation is shaped by rapid transitions between states of different character and multiplicity. Even though transient absorption experiments enable characterization in terms of kinetic rates, the complexity of the systems usually prevents a more detailed analysis. Quantum dynamics simulations using quantum chemically determined model Hamiltonians may provide such details. In particular, one is tempted to pursue a model reduction, such as to identify couplings or vibrational modes most relevant for the dynamics. Here, we address how such an endeavor is challenged by the particular nature of transition metal complexes. For that purpose, we performed quantum dynamics simulations for a recently studied iron(II) homoleptic complex. ",

    "abstract": "Valley photonic crystal (VPhC) waveguides have attracted much attention because of their ability to enable robust light propagation against sharp bends. However, their demonstration using a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process suitable for mass production has not yet been reported at the telecom wavelengths. Here, by tailoring the photomask to suppress the optical proximity effect, VPhC patterns comprising equilateral triangular holes were successfully fabricated using photolithography. We optically characterized the fabricated VPhC devices using microscopic optics with near-infrared imaging. For comparison, we also fabricated and characterized line-defect W1 PhC waveguides, in which the transmission intensities decreased at some regions within the operating bandwidth when sharp turns were introduced into the waveguide. In contrast, the developed VPhC waveguides can robustly propagate light around the C-band telecommunication wavelengths, even in the presence of sharp bends. Our results highlight the potential of VPhC waveguides as an interconnection technology in silicon topological photonic integrated circuits. ",

    "abstract": "Unipolar and quasi-unipolar half-cycle pulses having nonzero electric pulse area are a limit of pulse shortening in a given spectral range. In spite of the fact that existence of such pulses was considered by Jackson (1962), V.L. Ginzburg (1960-s), Bullough and Ahmad (1971) as well as Bessonov (1981), the possibility of their existence and propagation in space remained questionable for many years. Only within the past decades both the possibility of unipolar pulse existence and their propagation dynamics were shown and analyzed in detail theoretically and experimentally. So far such pulses became a subject of active research due to their potential in the ultra-fast optics and study of new regimes of light-matter interactions with subcycle resolution. Here, we show the possibility of the effective ultrafast control of the level populations in quantum well nanostructures by the half-cycle unipolar attosecond light pulses in comparison to the single-cycle ones. It is shown that the population dynamics can be determined by the electric pulse area divided to its characteristic \"scale\" determined by the quantum well width. The selective excitation of quantum states and the feasibility of the population inversion by the subcycle unipolar pulses is demonstrated. ",

Based on the principle of Like dissolves like, we combine theoretical calculations and a robotic platform to accelerate the purification of those molecules.

    "abstract": "The introduction of nonlinear nanophotonic devices to the field of optical frequency comb metrology has enabled new opportunities for low-power and chip-integrated clocks, high-precision frequency synthesis, and broad bandwidth spectroscopy. However, most of these advances remain constrained to the near-infrared region of the spectrum, which has restricted the integration of frequency combs with numerous quantum and atomic systems in the ultraviolet and visible. Here, we overcome this shortcoming with the introduction of multi-segment nanophotonic thin-film lithium niobate (LN) waveguides that combine engineered dispersion and chirped quasi-phase matching for efficient supercontinuum generation via the combination of $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. With only 90 pJ of pulse energy at 1550 nm, we achieve gap-free frequency comb coverage spanning 330 to 2400 nm. The conversion efficiency from the near-infrared pump to the UV-Visible region of 350-550 nm is nearly 20%. Harmonic generation via the $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity in the same waveguide directly yields the carrier-envelope offset frequency and a means to verify the comb coherence at wavelengths as short as 350 nm. Our results provide an integrated photonics approach to create visible and UV frequency combs that will impact precision spectroscopy, quantum information processing, and optical clock applications in this important spectral window.

The dependence of THz yields in bichomatic laser fields on ellipticity and interpulse time delay were experimentally measured, and the trajectory-based calculations straightforwardly establish the link between the THz emission and the motion of photoelectron wave packet under the influence of the Coulomb potential. The asymmetry of the photoelectron wave packet modified by the Coulomb potential imprints itself on the polarization direction of the THz electric fields. By filtering out the rapidly-varying dynamics of the propagating wave packet while retaining the slowly-varying dynamics, the Coulomb potential of the generating medium is retrieved from the Coulomb-reshaped THz radiation. Our work opens a path towards all-optical THz detection of electronic and structural dynamics, which might also allow to resolve the photo-excited dynamics in condensed phase systems. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel selective discontinuity sensor approach for numerical simulations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Since transformation to characteristic space is already a common approach to reduce high-frequency oscillations during interpolation to cell interfaces, we exploit the characteristic wave structure of the Euler equations to selectively treat the various waves that the equations comprise. The approach uses the Ducros shock sensing criterion to detect and limit oscillations due to shocks while applying a different criterion to detect and limit oscillations due to contact discontinuities. Furthermore, the method is general in the sense that it can be applied to any method that employs characteristic transformation and shock sensors. However, in the present work, we focus on the Gradient-Based Reconstruction family of schemes. A series of inviscid and viscous test cases containing various types of discontinuities are carried out. The proposed method is shown to markedly reduce high-frequency oscillations that arise due to improper treatment of the various discontinuities; i.e., applying the Ducros shock sensor in a flow where a strong contact discontinuity is present. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to predict similar volume-averaged kinetic energy and enstrophy profiles for the Taylor-Green vortex simulation compared to the base Ducros sensor, indicating that it does not introduce unnecessary numerical dissipation when there are no contact discontinuities in the flow.

Recent theoretical breakthrough revealed that, under the projective symmetry algebra enforced by artificial gauge fields, the usual two-dimensional (2D) BZ (orientable Brillouin two-torus) can be fundamentally modified to a non-orientable Brillouin Klein bottle with radically distinct topology and novel topological phases. However, the physical consequence of artificial gauge fields on the more general three-dimensional (3D) BZ (orientable Brillouin three-torus) was so far missing. Here, we report the first theoretical discovery and experimental observation of non-orientable Brillouin Klein space and orientable Brillouin half-turn space in a 3D acoustic crystal with artificial gauge fields. We experimentally identify peculiar 3D momentum-space non-symmorphic screw rotation and glide reflection symmetries in the measured band structures. Moreover, we demonstrate a novel 3D Klein bottle insulator featuring a nonzero Z_2 topological invariant and self-collimated topological surface states at two opposite surfaces related by a nonlocal twist, radically distinct from all previous topological insulators. Our discovery not only fundamentally modifies the 3D Bloch band theory and 3D BZ, but also opens the door towards a wealth of previously overlooked momentum-space topologies and unexplored topological physics with gauge symmetry beyond the existing paradigms.

Utilizing quantum dot molecules that manifest two coupled emission centers, we present a novel electric-field induced instantaneous color switching effect. Reversible emission color switching without intensity loss is achieved on a single particle level, as corroborated by correlated electron microscopy imaging. Simulations establish that this is due to the electron wavefunction toggling between the two centers dictated by the electric-field and affected by the coupling strength. The quantum dot molecules manifesting two coupled emission centers may be tailored to emit distinct colors, opening the path for sensitive field sensing and color switchable devices such as a novel pixel design for displays or an electric field color tunable single photon source.

Compared with the PINN and gPINN, TL-gPINN yields considerable improvement in accuracy. Moreover, our method leverages the advantage of the transfer learning technique, which can help to mitigate the problem of inefficiency caused by extra loss terms of the gradient. Numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the TL-gPINN method in significant accuracy enhancement, and it also outperforms gPINN in efficiency even when the training data was corrupted with different levels of noise or hyper-parameters of neural networks are arbitrarily changed.

    "title": "Ultrasound cavitation and exfoliation dynamics of 2D materials re-vealed  in operando by X-ray free electron laser megahertz imaging",
    "abstract": "Ultrasonic liquid phase exfoliation is a promising method for the production of 2D layered materials. A large number of studies have been made in investigating the underlying ultrasound exfoliation mechanisms. Due to the experimental challenge in capturing in real-time the highly transient and dynamic phenomena in sub-microsecond time scale and micrometer length scale at the same time, most theories reported to date are still under intensive debate. Here, we report the exciting new findings from the first scheduled user experiment using the free electron laser MHz X-ray Microscopy at the SPB/SFX instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser. The ultra-short X-ray pulse (~25 fs) and the unique pulse train time structure allow us to reveal fully the ultrasound cavitation dynamics, including the nucleation, growth, implosion dynamics of cavitation bubbles at different wave amplitudes. Using ma-chine-learning image processing, the instance of bubble cloud shock wave emission, their periodic impact onto the graphite materials and the cyclic fatigue exfoliation mechanism in multi-time scale from sub-microsecond to tens of minutes were all quantified and elucidated in this research.

    "abstract": "We present an innovative contactless method suitable to study in-plane thermal transport based on beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance using a one-dimensional heat source with uniform power distribution. Using a one-dimensional heat source provides a number of advantages as compared to point-like heat sources, as typically used in time- and frequency-domain thermoreflectance experiments, just to name a few: (i) it leads to a slower spatial decay of the temperature field in the direction perpendicular to the line-shaped heat source, allowing to probe the temperature field at larger distances from the heater, hence, enhancing the sensitivity to in-plane thermal transport; (ii) the frequency range of interest is typically < 100 kHz. This rather low frequency range is convenient regarding the cost of the required excitation laser system but, most importantly, it allows the study of materials without the presence of a metallic transducer with almost no influence of the finite optical penetration depth of the pump and probe beams on the thermal phase lag, which arises from the large thermal penetration depth imposed by the used frequency range. We also show that for the case of a harmonic thermal excitation source, the phase lag between the thermal excitation and thermal response of the sample exhibits a linear dependence with their spatial offset, where the slope is proportional to the inverse of the thermal diffusivity of the material. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to the cases of: (i) suspended thin films of Si and PDPP4T, (ii) Bi bulk samples, and (iii) Si, glass, and highly-oriented pyrollitic graphite (HOPG) bulk samples with a thin metallic transducer. Finally, we also show that it is possible to study in-plane heat transport on substrates with rather low thermal diffusivity, e.g., glass, even using a metallic transducer. ",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the self-assembly and subsequent diamond growth on SiO$_2$ buffered lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_3$) single crystals. The zeta-potential of LNO and LTO single crystal were measured as a function of pH. They were found to be negative in the pH range 3.5-9.5. The isoelectric point for LNO was found to be at pH $\\sim$ 2.91 and that of LTO to be at pH $\\sim$ 3.20. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed on the surfaces show presence of oxygen groups which may be responsible for the negative zeta potential of the crystals. Self-assembly of nanodiamond particles on LTO and LNO, using nanodiamond colloid, were studied. As expected, high nanodiamond density was seen when self-assembly was done using a positively charged nanodiamond particles. Diamond growth was attempted on the nanodiamond coated substrates but they were found to be unsuitable for direct growth due to disintegration of substrates in diamond growth conditions.. A $\\sim$100nm thick silicon dioxide layer was deposited on the crystals, followed by nanodiamond self assembly and diamond growth. Thin diamond films were successfully grown on both coated crystals. The diamond quality was analysed by Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. ",

    "title": "Effect of the inclination in the passage through the 5/3 mean motion  resonance between Ariel and Umbriel",
    "abstract": "The orbits of the main satellites of Uranus are expected to slowly drift away owing to tides raised in the planet. As a result, the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel was likely encountered in the past. Previous studies have shown that, in order to prevent entrapment in this resonance, the eccentricities of the satellites must be larger than $\\sim 0.01$ at the epoch, which is hard to explain. On the other hand, if the satellites experience some temporary capture and then escape, the inclinations rise to high values that are not observed today. We have revisited this problem both analytically and numerically focussing on the inclination, using a secular two-satellite model with circular orbits. We show that if the inclination of Umbriel was around $0.15^{\\circ}$ at the time of the 5/3 resonance encounter, capture can be avoided in about $60\\%$ of the cases. Moreover, after the resonance crossing, the inclination of Umbriel drops to a mean value around $0.08^{\\circ}$, which is close to the presently observed one. The final inclination of Ariel is distributed between $0.01^{\\circ}$ and $0.25^{\\circ}$ with a nearly equal probability, which includes the present mean value of $0.02^{\\circ}$. ",
