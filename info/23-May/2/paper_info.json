    "abstract": "We have investigated the impact of microsolvation on the shape resonance states of nucleobases, taking cytosine as a case study. To characterize the resonance position and decay width of the metastable states, we employed the newly developed DLPNO-based EA-EOMCCSD method in conjunction with resonance via Pad\\'e approximation. Our calculations show that the presence of water molecules causes a red shift in the resonance position and an increase in the lifetime for all three resonance states. Furthermore, the lowest resonance state in isolated cytosine was converted to a bound state in the presence of an aqueous environment. The calculated results are extremely sensitive to the basis set used for the calculations. ",

    "abstract": "A typical task for classical and quantum computing in chemistry is finding a potential energy surface (PES) along a reaction coordinate, which involves solving the quantum chemistry problem for many points along the reaction path. Developing algorithms to accomplish this task on quantum computers has been an active area of development, yet finding all the relevant eigenstates along the reaction coordinate remains a difficult problem, and determining PESs is thus a costly proposal. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of a eigenvector continuation -- a subspace expansion that uses a few eigenstates as a basis -- as a tool for rapidly exploring potential energy surfaces. We apply this to determining the binding PES or torsion PES for several molecules of varying complexity. In all cases, we show that the PES can be captured using relatively few basis states; suggesting that a significant amount of (quantum) computational effort can be saved by making use of already calculated ground states in this manner.

    "abstract": "Undergraduate quantum mechanics focuses on teaching through a wavefunction approach in the position-space representation. This leads to a differential equation perspective for teaching the material. However, we know that abstract representation-independent approaches often work better with students, by comparing student reactions to learning the series solution of the harmonic oscillator versus the abstract operator method. Because one can teach all of the solvable quantum problems using a similar abstract method, it brings up the question, which is likely to lead to a better student understanding? In work at Georgetown University and with edX, we have been teaching a class focused on an operator-forward viewpoint, which we like to call operator mechanics. It teaches quantum mechanics in a representation-independent fashion and allows for most of the math to be algebraic, rather than based on differential equations. It relies on four fundamental operator identities -- (i) the Leibniz rule for commutators; (ii) the Hadamard lemma; (iii) the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula; and (iv) the exponential disentangling identity. These identities allow one to solve eigenvalues, eigenstates and wavefunctions for all analytically solvable problems (including some not often included in undergraduate curricula, such as the Morse potential or the Poschl-Teller potential). It also allows for more advanced concepts relevant for quantum sensing, such as squeezed states, to be introduced in a simpler format than is conventionally done. In this paper, we illustrate the three approaches of matrix mechanics, wave mechanics, and operator mechanics, we show how one organizes a class in this new format, we summarize the experiences we have had with teaching quantum mechanics in this fashion and we describe how it allows us to focus the quantum curriculum on more modern 21st century topics appropriate for the ",

    "abstract": "In the last decades nanostructures have unlocked myriads of functionalities in nanophotonics by engineering light-matter interaction beyond what is possible with conventional bulk optics. The space of parameters available for design is practically unlimited due to the large variety of optical materials and geometries that can be realized by nanofabrication techniques. Thus, computational approaches are necessary to efficiently search for optimal solutions. In this paper, we enable the free-form inverse design in 3D of linear optical materials with arbitrary dispersion and anisotropy. This is achieved by implementing the adjoint method based on the complex-conjugate pole-residue pair model within a parallel finite-difference time-domain solver, suitable for high-performance computing systems. Our method is tested on the canonical nanophotonic problem of field enhancement in a gap region. The obtained free-form designs of metallic and dielectric materials satisfy the fundamental curiosity of how optimized nanostructures look like in 3D. Unconventional free-form designs revealed by our method, although may be challenging or unfeasible with current technology, bring new insight into how light interacts with nanostructures, and could provide new ideas to inspire forward design.

    "abstract": "By means of a modified Lugiato-Lefever equation model, we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dissipative wave structures in coherently-driven Kerr cavities with a parabolic potential. The potential stabilizes system dynamics, leading to the generation of robust dissipative solitons in the positive detuning regime, and of higher-order solitons in the negative detuning regime. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms which are responsible for these high-order states, we decompose the field on the basis of linear eigenmodes of the system. This permits to investigate the resulting nonlinear mode coupling processes. By increasing the external pumping, one observes the emergence of high-order breathers and chaoticons. Our modal content analysis reveals that breathers are dominated by modes of corresponding orders, while chaoticons exhibit proper chaotic dynamics. We characterize the evolution of dissipative structures by using bifurcation diagrams, and confirm their stability by combining linear stability analysis results with numerical simulations. Finally, we draw phase diagrams that summarize the complex dynamics landscape, obtained when varying the pump, the detuning, and the strength of the potential. ",

The total electric field of the laser fields exhibits an absence of rotational symmetry, which leads to the generation of high harmonics of the same helicity across a broad range of spectral bandwidth. High-harmonics with the same helicity offer the opportunity to synthesize attosecond pulses with tunable ellipticity. The polarisation properties of the generated harmonics are robust against the variations in driving fields' parameters, such as wavelength, intensity ratio, and the sub-cycle phase between $\\omega-2\\omega$ fields.

    "abstract": "The nature of atomic vapors, their natural alignment with interatomic transitions, and their ease of use make them highly suited for spectrally narrow-banded optical filters. Atomic filters come in two flavors: a filter based on the absorption of light by the Doppler broadened atomic vapor, i.e., a notch filter, and a bandpass filter based on the transmission of resonant light caused by the Faraday effect. The notch filter uses the absorption of resonant photons to filter out a small spectral band around the atomic transition. The off-resonant part of the spectrum is fully transmitted. Atomic vapors based on the Faraday effect allow for suppression of the detuned spectral fraction. Transmission of light originates from the magnetically induced rotation of linear polarized light close to an atomic resonance. This filter constellation allows selective acceptance of specific light frequencies. In this manuscript, we discuss these two types of filters and elucidate the specialties of atomic line filters. We also present a practical guide on building such filter setups from scratch and discuss an approach to achieve an almost perfect atomic spectrum backed by theoretical calculations. ",

In particular, indium selenide (InSe) is a very promising 2D material due to its ultra-high carrier mobility and outstanding photo-responsivity. Here, we report a high-speed photodetector based on a multilayer 90 nm thick InSe integrated on a silicon nitride (SiN) waveguide. The device exhibits a low dark current of 10 nA at 1V bias, a remarkable photoresponsivity of 0.38 AW-1, and high external quantum efficiency of 48.4% measured at 5 V bias. This performance is tested at near-infrared (NIR) 976 nm wavelength under ambient conditions. Furthermore, using numerical and experimental investigations, the estimated absorption coefficient per unit length is 0.11dB/um. To determine the dynamic response of the photodetector, its small and large signal frequency response are also evaluated. A 3-dB radiofrequency (RF) bandwidth of 85 MHz is measured with an open-eye diagram observed at 1 Gbit/s data transmission. Given these outstanding optoelectronic merits, active photonic devices based on integrated multilayer InSe can be realized for a variety of applications including short-reach optical interconnects, LiDAR imaging, and biosensing.

First, we show that MRR weightbanks can be used in conjuction with the spiking VCSEL-neurons to perform amplitude weighting of sub-ns optical spiking signals. Second, we show that a continuous firing VCSEL-neuron can be directly modulated using a locking signal propagated through a single weighting micro-ring, and we utilize this functionality to perform optical spike firing rate-coding via thermal tuning of the micro-ring resonator. Given the significant track record of both integrated weight banks and photonic VCSEL-neurons, we believe these results demonstrate the viability of combining these two classes of devices for use in functional neuromorphic photonic systems.

First, a stable and efficient analytical method is established for fast calculation of the dispersion curves based on spectral expansion and enforcement of continuity between segments at suitable collocation points. The analysis is validated by a commercial finite element software. The geometric design of the waveguide is then optimized for the emergence of a nearly-flat dispersion curve associated with vertical geometric asymmetry. The waveguide is fabricated using 3D printing technology and the measurement results corroborate the numerical simulations. Based on the nearly-flat dispersion curve supported by this waveguide, a CO$_2$ sensor is proposed allowing to relate the phase difference measured between two points in the waveguide to the composition of the gas in the waveguide. The proposed sensor is experimentally validated in a controlled environment and the measurement results match the computational predictions well. The sensor is robust with respect to noise and signal-recording duration due to fast phase measurements and shows high sensitivity to gas concentration due to reliance on the second, nearly-flat, dispersion curve. In addition, the sensor is label-free and low-cost, while exhibiting rapid response, low-maintenance requirements and potential for measurements in a wide range of CO$_2$ concentrations without saturation issues.

Here we present a flexible strategy for the realization of highly efficient grating couplers on low-index photonic platforms. To simultaneously reach a high scattering efficiency and a near-unitary modal overlap with optical fibers, we make use of self-imaging gratings designed with a negative diffraction angle. To ensure high directionality of the diffracted light, we take advantage of a metal back-reflector patterned underneath the grating structure by cryogenic deep reactive ion etching of the silicon handle. Using silicon nitride as a testbed material, we experimentally demonstrate coupling efficiency up to -0.55 dB in the telecom C-band with near unity chip-scale device yield. ",

    "abstract": "A measurement performed on a quantum system is an act of gaining information about its state. This viewpoint is widely held both in practical applications and foundational research. The former applications treat information theory as a pure mathematical tool; while in the latter, information plays a central role in many reconstructions of quantum theory. However, the concept of information is usually remained obscure. We are investigating the information towards the reconstruction of quantum theory from an operational approach: what is the information gained from the quantum measurement data. We start from the generalization of continuous entropy and find there is more than one natural measure of the information gained as more data is received. One of these (differential information gain) can increase or decrease with more data, depending upon the prior; another measure (relative information gain) is an increasing function of the amount of data even when the amount of data is finite, and is asymptotically insensitive to the specific data or choice of prior. Both two measures can be regarded as extensions of relative entropy. We propose a Principle of Information Increase from Summhammer's intuitive idea: more data lead to more knowledge. This principle is used to filter choices of prior for prior-sensitive information measures when investigating the information gain from data of quantum measurements. Both numerical and asymptotic analysis are conducted using beta distribution priors. It is showed that in two-outcome quantum systems differential information gain will be more physical meaningful and Jeffreys' prior exhibits a special behavior which is the strong robustness of information gain over all possible data. The expected values of both information gain are equivalent, which suggests that the expected form is unique and the discrepancies are disappeared when taking the averages. ",

Our study combines theoretical and experimental investigations of AlGaN/GaN grating-gate structures and reveals that all terahertz (THz) plasmonic resonances in these structures can be explained only within the framework of the plasmonic crystal model. We identify two different plasmonic crystal phases. The first is the delocalized phase, where THz radiation interacts with the entire grating-gate structure that is realized at a weakly modulated 2D electron gas (2DEG) regime. In the second, the localized phase, THz radiation interacts only with the ungated portions of the structure. This phase is achieved by fully depleting the gated regions, resulting in strong modulation. By gate-controlling of the modulation degree, we observe a continuous transition between these phases. We also discovered that the resonant frequency of the localized phase depends on the gate voltage. We attribute this phenomenon to the specific depletion of the conductive profile in the ungated region of the 2DEG, the so-called edge gating effect. Although we study a specific case of plasmons in AlGaN/GaN grating-gate structures, our results have a general character and are applicable to any other semiconductor-based plasmonic crystal structures. Our work represents the first demonstration of an electrically tunable transition between different phases of THz plasmonic crystals, which is a crucial step towards a deeper understanding of THz plasma physics and the development of all-electrically tunable devices for THz optoelectronics.
