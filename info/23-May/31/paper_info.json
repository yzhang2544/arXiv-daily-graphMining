    "title": "Quantum Rate Theory and Electron-Transfer Dynamics: A Theoretical and  Experimental Approach for Quantum Electrochemistry",
    "abstract": "Quantum rate theory is based on a first-principle quantum mechanical rate concept that comprises with the Planck-Einstein relationship $E = h\\nu$, where $\\nu = e^2/hC_q$ is a frequency associated with the quantum capacitance $C_q$ and $E = e^2/C_q$ is the energy associated with $\\nu$. For a single state mode of transmittance, $e^2/C_q$ corresponds to the chemical potential differences $\\Delta \\mu$ between donor and acceptor state levels comprising an electrochemical reaction. The latter assumption implies quantum electrodynamics within a particular quantum transport mode intrinsically coupled to the electron-transfer rate of electrochemical reactions that have not been considered thus far. Here it is demonstrated that the consideration of this inherent quantum transport is key to obtaining an in-depth understanding of the electron transfer phenomenon. Finally, the theory is validated through its description of electron transfer, quantum conductance, and capacitance in different electro-active molecular films. ",

    "title": "Photonic Snake States in Two-Dimensional Frequency Combs",
    "abstract": "Taming the instabilities inherent to many nonlinear optical phenomena is of paramount importance for modern photonics. In particular, the so-called snake instability is universally known to severely distort localized wave stripes, leading to the occurrence of transient, short-lived dynamical states that eventually decay. The phenomenon is ubiquitous in nonlinear science, from river meandering to superfluids, and to date it remains apparently uncontrollable. However, here we show that optical snake instabilities can be harnessed by a process that leads to the formation of stationary and robust two-dimensional zigzag states. We find that such new type of nonlinear waves exists in the hyperbolic regime of cylindrical micro-resonators and it naturally corresponds to two-dimensional frequency combs featuring spectral heterogeneity and intrinsic synchronization. We uncover the conditions of the existence of such spatiotemporal photonic snakes and confirm their remarkable robustness against perturbations. Our findings represent a new paradigm for frequency comb generation, thus opening the door to a whole range of applications in communications, metrology, and spectroscopy. ",

Here we report an automated testbench that checks the detector's vulnerabilities against these attacks. We illustrate its performance by testing a free-running detector that includes a rudimentary countermeasure measuring an average photocurrent. While our testbench automatically finds the detector to be controllable in a continuous-blinding regime, the countermeasure registers photocurrent significantly exceeding that in a quantum regime, thus revealing the attack. We then perform manually a pulsed blinding attack, which controls the detector intermittently. This attack is missed by the countermeasure in a wide range of blinding pulse durations and powers, still allowing to eavesdrop the key. We make recommendations for improvement of both the testbench and countermeasure. ",

    "abstract": "The miniaturization of nonlinear light sources is central to the integrated photonic platform, driving a quest for high-efficiency frequency generation and mixing at the nanoscale. In this quest, the high-quality ($Q$) resonant dielectric nanostructures hold great promise, as they enhance nonlinear effects through the resonantly local electromagnetic fields overlapping the chosen nonlinear materials. Here, we propose a method for the enhanced sum-frequency generation (SFG) from etcheless lithium niobate (LiNbO$_{3}$) by utilizing the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in a one-dimensional resonant grating waveguide structure. Two high-$Q$ guided mode resonances corresponding to the dual quasi-BICs are respectively excited by two near-infrared input beams, generating a strong visible SFG signal with a remarkably high conversion efficiency of $3.66\\times10^{-2}$ (which is five orders of magnitude higher than that of LiNbO$_{3}$ films of the same thickness) and a small full-width at half-maximum less than 0.2 nm. The SFG efficiency can be tuned via adjusting the grating geometry parameter or choosing the input beam polarization combination. Furthermore, the generated SFG signal can be maintained at a fixed wavelength without the appreciable loss of efficiency by selectively exciting the angular-dependent quasi-BICs, even if the wavelengths of input beams are tuned within a broad spectral range. Our results provide a simple but robust paradigm of high-efficiency frequency conversion on an easy-fabricated platform, which may find applications in nonlinear light sources and quantum photonics.

Experimental validation of the proposed polarization synthesis concept is conducted using a 16$\\times$16 dual-CP 1-bit reconfigurable reflectarray operating at 16.8 GHz. This reflectarray generates reconfigurable LP waves with polarization states of LP(0$^\\circ$), LP(45$^\\circ$), LP(90$^\\circ$) and LP(135$^\\circ$). Furthermore, it demonstrates the capability to perform beam scanning, allowing for versatile beam manipulation.

The method is based on the Berreman 4x4 matrix formalism, which is generalized to include nonlinear optical phenomena. It can be used under oblique incidences of the input beam, and is valid even when the SHG frequency is close to photonic bands, where the usual slowly-varying-amplitude approximation breaks down. As an example of application, we have studied the SHG performance of ferroelectric and helielectric nematic liquid crystals. The latter present a helicoidal structure that can be distorted under electric field. In the different tests of the method we have analyzed the conditions for the most efficient SHG, and compared with previous results in the case there were any. The obtained results indicate that the present procedure may contribute to improve the structural design and enlarge the variety of nonlinear optical materials for their application in optical devices.

Current technologies typically focus on implementing a single computation iteration optically while leaving the intermediate processing in the electronic domain, which are still limited by the electronic bottlenecks. Few explorations have been made of all-optical recursive architectures for computations on integrated photonic platforms. Here we propose a generic photonic integrated linear operator processor based on an all-optical recursive system that supports linear operations ranging from matrix computations to solving equations. We demonstrate the first all-optical on-chip matrix inversion system and use this to solve integral and differential equations. The absence of electronic processing during multiple iterations indicates the potential for an orders-of-magnitudes speed enhancement of this all-optical computing approach compared to electronic computers. We realize matrix inversions, Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, 2^{nd} order ordinary differential equations, and Poisson equations using the generic photonic integrated linear operator processor.

    "abstract": "The coherent interaction between a two-level system and electromagnetic fields serves as a foundation for fundamental quantum physics and modern photonic quantum technology. A profound example is resonance fluorescence, where the non-classical photon emission appears in the form of a Mollow-triplet when a two-level system is continuously driven by a resonant laser. Pushing resonance fluorescence from a static to dynamic regime by using short optical pulses generates on-demand emissions of highly coherent single photons. Further increasing the driving strength in the dynamical regime enables the pursuit of exotic non-classical light emission in photon number superposition, photon number entanglement, and photon bundle states. However, the long-sought-after spectrum beyond the Mollow-triplet, a characteristic of dynamic resonance fluorescence under strong driving strength, has not been observed yet. Here we report the direct observation and systematic investigations of dynamic resonance fluorescence spectra beyond the Mollow-triplet in a solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamic system. The dynamic resonance fluorescence spectra with up to five pairs of side peaks, excitation detuning induced spectral asymmetry, and cavity filtering effect are observed and quantitatively modeled by a full quantum model with phonon scattering included. Time-resolved measurements further reveal that the multiple side peaks originate from interference of the emission associated with different temporal positions of the excitation pulses. Our work facilitates the generation of a variety of exotic quantum states of light with dynamic driving of two-level systems. ",

Approximations are introduced via a proper choice of the many-particle selfenergy or decoupling of the BBGKY-hierarchy, respectively. These approximations are based on Feynman's diagram approaches or on cluster expansions into single-particle and correlation operators. In a recent paper [E. Schroedter, J.-P. Joost, and M. Bonitz, Cond. Matt. Phys. \\textbf{25}, 23401 (2022)] we have presented a different approach where, instead of equations of motion for the many-particle NEGF (or density operators), equations for the correlation functions of fluctuations are analyzed. In particular, we derived the stochastic GW and polarization approximations that are closely related to the nonequilibrium GW approximation. Here, we extend this approach to the computation of two-time observables depending on the specific ordering of the underlying operators. In particular, we apply this extension to the calculation of the density correlation function and dynamic structure factor of correlated Hubbard clusters in and out of equilbrium. ",

To take a step towards easy-to-understand and reproducible research of scientific design, we propose a benchmark for the inverse design of nanophotonic devices, which can be verified computationally and accurately. Specifically, we implemented three different nanophotonic design problems, namely a radiative cooler, a selective emitter for thermophotovoltaics, and structural color filters, all of which are different in design parameter spaces, complexity, and design targets. The benchmark environments are implemented with an open-source simulator. We further implemented 10 different inverse design algorithms and compared them in a reproducible and fair framework. The results revealed the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, which shed light on several future directions for developing more efficient inverse design algorithms.

Optics-based platforms, using technologies such as silicon photonics and spatial light modulators, offer promising avenues for achieving this goal. However, training multiple trainable layers in tandem with these physical systems poses challenges, as they are difficult to fully characterize and describe with differentiable functions, hindering the use of error backpropagation algorithm. The recently introduced Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) eliminates the need for perfect characterization of the learning system and shows promise for efficient training with large numbers of programmable parameters. The FFA does not require backpropagating an error signal to update the weights, rather the weights are updated by only sending information in one direction. The local loss function for each set of trainable weights enables low-power analog hardware implementations without resorting to metaheuristic algorithms or reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present an experiment utilizing multimode nonlinear wave propagation in an optical fiber demonstrating the feasibility of the FFA approach using an optical system. The results show that incorporating optical transforms in multilayer NN architectures trained with the FFA, can lead to performance improvements, even with a relatively small number of trainable weights. The proposed method offers a new path to the challenge of training optical NNs and provides insights into leveraging physical transformations for enhancing NN performance. ",
