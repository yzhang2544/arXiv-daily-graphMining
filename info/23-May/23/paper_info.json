    "abstract": "Establishing the underlying links between the diverse landscape of theoretical frameworks for simulating strongly correlated matter is crucial for advancing our understanding of these systems. In this work, we focus on the Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA), an extension of the Gutzwiller Approximation (GA) based on the variational principle. We derive a framework called \"Ghost Density Matrix Embedding Theory\" (gDMET) from quantum embedding (QE) principles similar to those in Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET), which reproduces the gGA equations for multi-orbital Hubbard models with a simpler implementation. This derivation highlights the crucial role of the ghost degrees of freedom, not only as an extension to the GA, but also as the key element in establishing a consistent conceptual connection between DMET and the gGA. This connection further elucidates how gGA overcomes the systematic accuracy limitations of standard GA and achieves results comparable to Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). Furthermore, it offers an alternative interpretation of the gGA equations, fostering new ideas and generalizations. ",

The metasurface is driven by a sequential tandem neural network which is pre-trained using actual experimental data, avoiding any possible errors that may arise from calculation, simulation or manufacturing tolerances. This platform empowers the surface to operate accurately in a complex environment including varying incident angle and operating frequency, or even with other scatterers present close to the surface.

However the inherent polarization anisotropy in 2D-materials and device tradeoffs lead to additional requirements with respect to electric field directions and modal confinement. A detailed relationship between modal confinement factor and obtainable modulation strength including definitions on bounding limits are outstanding. Here we show that the modal confinement factor is a key parameter determining both the modulation strength and the modulator extinction ratio-to-insertion loss metric. We show that the modal confinement and hence the modulation strength of a single-layer modulated 2D material in a plasmonically confined mode is able to improve by more than 10x compared to diffraction-limited modes. Combined with the strong-index modulation of graphene the modulation strength can be more than 2-orders of magnitude higher compared to Silicon-based EAMs. Furthermore modal confinement was found to be synergistic with performance optimization via enhanced light-matter-interactions. These results show that there is room for scaling 2D material EAMs with respect to modal engineering towards realizing synergistic designs leading to high-performance modulators. ",

Recent progress on nonlinear metamaterials and metasurfaces suggests promising solutions to overcome the limitations of nonlinear materials in nature. Here we present a design concept for highly enhanced saturable absorption effect based on subwavelength-thick (<1/5$\\lambda$0) hybrid graphene-plasmonic metasurface structures in infrared wavelengths. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that, by exciting nonequilibrium carriers inside nanoscale hotspots, one could not only enhance the saturable absorption in graphene, but also reduce the saturation fluence by over 3 orders of magnitude (from ~ 1 mJ/cm2 to ~100 nJ/cm2). Our pump-probe measurement results suggested an ultrashort saturable absorption recovery time (<60 fs), which is ultimately determined by the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in graphene. We also observed pulse narrowing effects in our devices based on the autocorrelation measurement results. Such design concepts can be tailored via structure engineering to operate in broader wavelength ranges up to mid- and far- infrared spectral regions. These ultrafast low-saturation fluence saturable absorber designs can enable low-threshold, compact, self-starting mode-locked lasers, laser pulse shaping, and high-speed optical information processing.

    "abstract": "Free space optical (FSO) communication can exploit mode-division multiplexing using orthogonal spatial modes of Laguerre Gaussian beams, such as orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, wherein OAM multiplexing offers potentially infinite information capacity due to the arbitrary quantization of OAM. Combined with polarization-division multiplexing and wavelength-division multiplexing, OAM multiplexing is a promising solution for future capacity demands. However, the practically addressable number of spatial subchannels is severely limited by the receiver size and the rapid beam expansion with increasing mode order and communication distance. Based on the intrinsic and distinctive property that the divergent degree of the innermost ring of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam is significantly slower than that of the beam cross-section during propagation, here we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel communication strategy innermost ring dominated OAM (IRD-OAM) multiplexingn that can overcome these limits and achieve up to 1238% capacity of conventional OAM multiplexing in a canonical FSO link system without any additional hardware modifications. Alternatively, our strategy can also enable longer communication distance (403% of that for conventional OAM multiplexing), or smaller receiver (26.9% in size compared to conventional OAM multiplexing), while maintaining the same capacity as conventional OAM multiplexing. Our work will hasten the development of future FSO communications with ultra high capacity, ultra long distance and highly-integrated devices for deep space, near Earth and Earth surface applications.

To this end, much optical atomic clock research has focused on reducing clock instability by increasing the atom number, lengthening the coherent interrogation times, and introducing entanglement to push beyond the standard quantum limit. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach to reducing clock instability using a phase estimation approach based on individually controlled atomic ensembles in a strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock. We first demonstrate joint Ramsey interrogation of two spatially-resolved atom ensembles that are out of phase with respect to each other, which we call \"quadrature Ramsey spectroscopy,\" resulting in a factor of 1.36(5) reduction in absolute clock instability as measured with interleaved self-comparisons. We then leverage the rich hyperfine structure of ${}^{87}$Sr to realize independent coherent control over multiple ensembles with only global laser addressing. Finally, we utilize this independent control over 4 atom ensembles to implement a form of phase estimation, achieving a factor of greater than 3 enhancement in coherent interrogation time and a factor of 2.08(6) reduction in instability over an otherwise identical single ensemble clock with the same local oscillator and the same number of atoms. We expect that multi-ensemble protocols similar to those demonstrated here will result in reduction in the instability of any optical lattice clock with an interrogation time limited by the local oscillator.

Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG), as the most typical representative of external seeded FELs, has unparalleled harmonic conversion efficiency. However, due to the limitations of various collective effects, the harmonic conversion of a high-gain EEHG that has been proved in experiments does not exceed 50 times. This paper proposes a new EEHG technology with the help of harmonic optical klystron technology, which can effectively increase the number of harmonic conversion to about 100 times. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that intense and almost fully coherent FEL pulses with a radiation wavelength of 3 nm can be generated. At the same time, the seed laser intensity required by this scheme is lower, compared to nominal EEHG, thus facilitating the generation of high repetition rate seeded FELs. ",

Though already competes with many traditional quantum chemistry methods, describing electronic wave function of molecules using NQS is just in its early stages. Here we introduce a general non-stochastic optimization algorithm for NQS in chemical systems, which deterministically generates a selected set of important configurations simultaneously with energy evaluation of NQS and sidesteps Markov-chain Monte Carlo that is required in the typical variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework, making the whole optimization smoother and faster. This newly developed non-stochastic optimization algorithm for NQS can recover the potential energy curves with a level of accuracy competitive with CCSD(T) in carbon dimer with cc-pVDZ basis after perturbative correction with ~$1.4\\times 10^{11}$ configurations in the full variational space, and to an accuracy of better than 0.2 mHa in strongly correlated equidistant hydrogen chain H10 with STO-6G basis. These successful applications of NQS to molecules that have large variational spaces or strong electron correlations manifest the strength of our non-stochastic optimization algorithm, provide further understanding about the performance of NQS in chemical systems and suggest routes for future improvements.

Our method is based on a far-field diffraction pattern from a binary transmission mask consisting of a non-redundant array of simple apertures. Unlike all currently available methods, our technique allows measuring radiation field with an arbitrary spatial coherence function without any prior assumption on intensity distribution or the model of the degree of spatial coherence. We experimentally verified the technique by retrieving the spatial coherence functions of individual shots of laser-driven Zn plasma soft X-ray laser with one- and two-dimensional masks. The experimental results revealed nontrivial illumination pattern and strong asymmetry of the spatial coherence function, which clearly calls for abandoning the often used models that assume rotational invariance of the coherence function, such as the popular Gaussian-Schell beam model.

    "abstract": "Characterizing the fluid-driven fracture tip advancing process presents a significant challenge due to the difficulty of replicating real-world conditions in laboratory experiments and the lack of precise field measurements. However, recent advances in low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (LF-DAS) technology offer new opportunities to investigate the dynamics of propagating hydraulic fractures. In this study, we propose an iterative inversion method to characterize fracture-tip advancing behaviors using LF-DAS data. A forward geomechanical model is developed using the three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method, and the optimization is realized by a conjugate gradient method. The performance of the inversion algorithm is demonstrated using a synthetic case, in which the fracture half-length evolution and propagation velocity match well with the reference solutions. Additionally, the averaged fracture cross-section area, fracture volume, and fracturing fluid efficiency can also be estimated, showing good agreements with true values of the synthetic case under reasonable assumptions. Then a field case with a single-cluster hydraulic fracturing treatment from the Hydraulic Fracturing Test Site 2 project (HFTS2) is studied. Our analysis of the inversion results reveal that the fracture propagates intermittently, as evidenced by the fracture half-length evolution. This unique field evidence can guide modeling efforts to incorporate this important physical behavior into fracture models, and the secondary information gathered from the study, including fracture cross-section area and volume, can help evaluate and optimize fracturing efficiency.

In this article, we explore one such possibility, based on Kent's `final-measurement' interpretation of quantum mechanics. We argue that this approach potentially has the resources to explain the electromagnetic asymmetry, the thermodynamic asymmetry, the coarse-graining asymmetry, the fork asymmetry, the record asymmetry, and the cosmological asymmetry, and that the explanations it offers may potentially be better than explanations appealing to a special initial state.

By T-matrix numerical simulations, we identify a TE-TM band splitting at the diagonals of the first Brillouin zone, that is not predicted by the empty lattice band structure nor by the highly symmetric nature of the system. Further, we find quantum metric around these regions of the reciprocal space, and even a non-zero Berry curvature despite the trivial lattice geometry and absence of magnetic field.

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers unconditional security in principle. Many QKD protocols have been proposed and demonstrated to ensure secure communication between two authenticated users. Continuous variable (CV) QKD offers many advantages over discrete variable (DV) QKD since it is cost-effective, compatible with current classical communication technologies, efficient even in daylight, and gives a higher secure key rate. Keeping this in view, we demonstrate a discrete modulated CVQKD protocol in the free space which is robust against polarization drift. We also present the simulation results with a noise model to account for the channel noise and the effects of various parameter changes on the secure key rate. These simulation results help us to verify the experimental values obtained for the implemented CVQKD. ",

    "abstract": "Ferroelectric materials exhibit interesting electric, mechanical and optical properties. Particularly,tin-film lead zirconium titanate (PZT) has been used as a standard piezo-electric material in micro-electro-mechanical systems. Interestingly, it has one of the highest electro-optic properties that can be exploited to make high-speed on-chip light modulators. In this work, we demonstrate sputter-deposited PZT on silicon-on-insulator wafers. Desired phase and film morphology is achieved through process and buffer layer engineering. We present results on buffer layer screening between MgO, TiO2 and Pt. MgO is identified as a suitable buffer layer from an optical and film growth perspective. We achieve a measured coercive field for PZT/MgO and PZT/Pt film is 50 kV/cm and 30 kV/cm, respectively. We use a PZT-loaded ring modulator with an electro-optic response of 14 pm/V. ",
