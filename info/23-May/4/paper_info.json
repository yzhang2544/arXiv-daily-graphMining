    "title": "Photonic Advantage of Optical Encoders",
    "abstract": "Light's ability to perform massive linear operations parallelly has recently inspired numerous demonstrations of optics-assisted artificial neural networks (ANN). However, a clear advantage of optics over purely digital ANN in a system-level has not yet been established. While linear operations can indeed be optically performed very efficiently, the lack of nonlinearity and signal regeneration require high-power, low-latency signal transduction between optics and electronics. Additionally, a large power is needed for the lasers and photodetectors, which are often neglected in the calculation of energy consumption. Here, instead of mapping traditional digital operations to optics, we co-optimized a hybrid optical-digital ANN, that operates on incoherent light, and thus amenable to operations under ambient light. Keeping the latency and power constant between purely digital ANN and hybrid optical-digital ANN, we identified a low-power/ latency regime, where an optical encoder provides higher classification accuracy than a purely digital ANN. However, in that regime, the overall classification accuracy is lower than what is achievable with higher power and latency. Our results indicate that optics can be advantageous over digital ANN in applications, where the overall performance of the ANN can be relaxed to prioritize lower power and latency. ",

    "abstract": "Recent exploration of collective phenomena in oscillator arrays has highlighted its potential for accessing a range of physical phenomena, from fundamental quantum many-body dynamics to the solution of practical optimization problems using photonic Ising machines. Spontaneous oscillations often arise in these oscillator arrays as an imbalance between gain and loss. Due to coupling between array individuals, the spontaneous oscillation is constrained and lead to interesting collective behavior, such as synchronized oscillations in optomechanical oscillator arrays, ferromagnetic-like coupling in delay-coupled optical parametric oscillators and binary phase states in coupled laser arrays. A key aspect of arrays is not only the coupling between its individuals but also their compliance towards neighbor stimuli. One self-sustaining photonic oscillator that can be readily implemented in a scalable foundry-based technology is based on the interaction of free-carriers, temperature and optical field of a resonant silicon photonic microcavity. Here we demonstrate that these silicon thermal-free-carrier oscillators are extremely compliant to external excitation and can be synchronized up to their 16$^\\text{th}$ harmonic using a weak seed. Exploring this unprecedented compliance to external stimuli, we also demonstrate robust synchronization between two thermal free carrier oscillators. ",

    "abstract": "The quality of electron beams produced from plasma-based accelerators, i.e., normalized brightness and energy spread, has made transformative progress in the past several decades in both simulation and experiment. Recently, full-scale particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that electron beams with unprecedented brightness ($10^{20}\\sim10^{21}~\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{rad}^2$) and $0.1\\sim 1$ MeV energy spread can be produced through controlled injection in a slowly expanding bubble that arises when a particle beam or laser pulse propagates in density gradient, or when a particle beam self-focuses in uniform plasma or has a superluminal flying focus. However, in previous simulations of work on self-injection triggered by an evolving laser driver in a uniform plasma, the resulting beams did not exhibit comparable brightnesses and energy spreads. Here, we demonstrate through the use of large-scale high-fidelity PIC simulations that a slowly expanding bubble driven by a laser pulse in a uniform plasma can indeed produce self-injected electron beams with similar brightnesses and energy spreads as for an evolving bubble driven by an electron beam driver. We consider laser spot sizes roughly equal to the matched spot sizes in a uniform plasma and find that the evolution of the bubble occurs naturally through the evolution of the laser. The effects of the electron beam quality on the choice of physical as well as numerical parameters, e.g. grid sizes and field solvers used in the PIC simulations are presented. It is found that this original and simplest injection scheme can produce electron beams with beam quality exceeding that of the more recent concepts. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems for kinetic energy harvesting have recently been designed that use nonlinear mechanical resonators and corresponding transducers to create electrical output. Nonlinearities are important for providing a broadband input frequency efficiency, which is necessary to ensure that the output voltage is at a satisfactory level in the case of a variable ambient vibration source. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of such a system with the additional possibility of a switching potential barrier in the nonlinear resonator. In order to improve the effectiveness of the energy harvester, we numerically test the possibility of using abrupt changes in the system parameters. We analyze the voltage output for various frequencies of both the harmonic excitations and the potential barrier switching. In a range that includes low and high switching frequencies of potentials, the periodic solutions dominate in the bifurcation diagrams. With regard to the large switching frequency, the effective values of the voltage at the piezoelectric electrodes are significantly reduced. The highest effective values of the voltage that are induced at the piezoelectric electrodes are observed when the chaotic solutions appear due to their specific ability to pass the potential barrier for relatively small excitation. The results also show that mechanical damping with high-enough magnitudes minimize the influence of the transient states caused by the switching potentials. ",

    "abstract": "Topological effects manifest in a wide range of physical systems, such as solid crystals, acoustic waves, photonic materials and cold atoms. These effects are characterized by `topological invariants' which are typically integer-valued, and lead to robust quantized channels of transport in space, time, and other degrees of freedom. The temporal channel, in particular, allows one to achieve higher-dimensional topological effects, by driving the system with multiple incommensurate frequencies. However, dissipation is generally detrimental to such topological effects, particularly when the systems consist of quantum spins or qubits. Here we introduce a photonic molecule subjected to multiple RF/optical drives and dissipation as a promising candidate system to observe quantized transport along Floquet synthetic dimensions. Topological energy pumping in the incommensurately modulated photonic molecule is enhanced by the driven-dissipative nature of our platform. Furthermore, we provide a path to realizing Weyl points and measuring the Berry curvature emanating from these reciprocal-space ($k$-space) magnetic monopoles, illustrating the capabilities for higher-dimensional topological Hamiltonian simulation in this platform. Our approach enables direct $k$-space engineering of a wide variety of Hamiltonians using modulation bandwidths that are well below the free-spectral range (FSR) of integrated photonic cavities. ",

Analysis of experiments performed at APOLLON PW-class laser facility shows that spatial instabilities of the focal spot, such as shot-to-shot pointing fluctuations or asymmetry of the transverse fluence, lead to charge and energy degradation of the accelerated electron bunch. It is shown that PIC simulations can reproduce experimental results with a significantly higher accuracy when the measured laser asymmetries are included in the simulated laser's transverse profile, compared to simulations with ideal, symmetric laser profile. A method based on a modified Gerchberg-Saxton iterative algorithm is used to retrieve the laser electric field from fluence measurements in vacuum in the focal volume, and accurately reproduce experimental results using PIC simulations, leading to simulated electron spectra in close agreement with experimental results, for the accelerated charge, energy distribution and pointing of the electron beam at the exit of the plasma.

We perform spectroscopy on single emitters and report the first observation of spin-dependent optical transitions, a key requirement for spin-photon interfaces. By engineering the isotopic composition of the SiC matrix, we reduce the inhomogeneous spectral distribution of different emitters down to 100 MHz, significantly smaller than any other single quantum emitter. Additionally, we tailor the dopant concentration to stabilise the telecom-wavelength V4+ charge state, thereby extending its lifetime by at least two orders of magnitude.

Although this has been of interest for a long time, current studies can either only provide bounds to those losses, or require several devices for a complete characterization. In this work, we introduce a method to measure the microwave losses of materials and interfaces with a single multi-mode superconducting resonator. We demonstrate a formalism for analyzing the loss sensitivity of multi-mode systems and discuss the design strategies of multi-mode resonators for material loss studies. We present two types of multi-mode superconducting resonators for the study of bulk superconductors: the forky whispering-gallery-mode resonator (FWGMR) and the ellipsoidal cavity. We use these resonators to measure the surface dielectric, conductor, and seam losses of high-purity (5N5) aluminum and aluminum alloy (6061), as well as how they are affected by chemical etching, diamond turning, and thin-film coating. We find that chemical etching and diamond turning reduce both the surface dielectric and conductive losses of high-purity aluminum, but provide no appreciable improvement to the seam. Coating the surfaces of diamond-turned aluminum alloys with e-beam evaporated or sputtered aluminum thin-films significantly reduces all three losses under study. In addition, we study the effect of chemical etching on the surface of high-purity aluminum using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and find that the chemical etching process creates a thinner and more uniform oxide layer, consistent with the observed improvement in the surface dielectric loss.

    "abstract": "Here we discuss the feasibility of photosynthesis on Earth-like rocky planets in close orbit around ultra-cool red dwarf stars. Stars of this type have very limited emission in the \\textit{photosynthetically active} region of the spectrum ($400 - 700$ nm), suggesting that they may not be able to support oxygenic photosynthesis. However, photoautotrophs on Earth frequently exploit very dim environments with the aid of highly structured and extremely efficient antenna systems. Moreover, the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, which do not need to oxidize water to source electrons, can exploit far red and near infrared light. Here we apply a simple model of a photosynthetic antenna to a range of model stellar spectra, ranging from ultra-cool (2300 K) to Sun-like (5800 K). We assume that a photosynthetic organism will evolve an antenna that maximizes the rate of energy input while also minimizing fluctuations. The latter is the 'noise cancelling' principle recently reported by Arp et al. 2020. Applied to the Solar spectrum this predicts optimal antenna configurations in agreement with the chlorophyll Soret absorption bands. Applied to cooler stars, the optimal antenna peaks become redder with decreasing stellar temperature, crossing to the typical wavelength ranges associated with anoxygenic photoautotrophs at $\\sim 3300$ K. Lastly, we compare the relative input power delivered by antennae of equivalent size around different stars and find that the predicted variation is within the same order of magnitude. We conclude that low-mass stars do not automatically present light-limiting conditions for photosynthesis but they may select for anoxygenic organisms. ",

    "abstract": "In a recent Letter by Romanenko et al. [APL-104-072601] the authors used low energy muon spin rotation to measure the Meissner screening profile in cutouts from Nb SRF cavities, systematically comparing how different surface treatments affect the screening properties of the elemental type-II superconductor. They reported a ``strong'' modification to the character of the screening profile upon mild baking at 120 degree celsius for 48 hours, which was interpreted as a depth-dependent carrier mean-free-path resulting from a ``gradient in vacancy concentration'' near the surface. While this observation led to speculation that this surface treatment yields an ``effective'' superconducting bilayer, we suggest that its likeness to such is accidental and that the behavior is an artifact from the analysis.

We then use variational Monte Carlo calculations of $\\Sigma(k,0)$ of the homogeneous electron gas at various densities to obtain results very close to perturbative $G_0 W_0$ calculations for values of the density parameter $1 \\le r_s \\le 10$. The obtained values for the effective mass are close to diagrammatic Monte Carlo results and disagree with previous quantum Monte Carlo calculations based on a heuristic mapping of excitation energies to those of an ideal gas.
