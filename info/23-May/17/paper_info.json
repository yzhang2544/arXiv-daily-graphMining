    "abstract": "Optical phonons serve as the fast and efficient carriers of energy across periodic polymers due to their delocalization, large group velocity because of covalent bonding and large energy quantum compared to that for acoustic phonons, as it was observed in a number of recent measurements in different oligomers. However, this transport is dramatically sensitive to anharmonic interactions, including the unavoidable interaction with acoustic phonons responsible for the transport decoherence, suppressing ballistic transport at long distances. Here we show that this decoherence is substantially suppressed if the group velocity of optical phonons is less than the sound velocity of acoustic phonons; otherwise ballistic transport is substantially suppressed by a Cherenkov's like emission of acoustic phonons. This conclusion is justified considering energy and momentum conservation during phonon absorption or emission and supported by the numerical evaluation of lifetimes of the optical phonons. It is also consistent with the recent experimental investigations of ballistic optical phonon transport in oligomers with minor exception of relatively short oligophenylenes. ",

    "abstract": "For the simulation of anisoplanatic optical turbulence, split-step propagation is the gold standard. Within the context of the degradations being limited to phase distortions, one instead may focus on generating the phase realizations directly, a method which has been utilized in previous so-called multi-aperture simulations. Presently, this modality assumes a constant $C_n^2$ profile. This work presents an alternative derivation for Zernike correlations under anisoplanatic conditions. Multi-aperture simulation may easily incorporate these correlations into its framework and achieve a significantly higher degree of accuracy with a minimal increase in time. We additionally use our developed methodology to explain previously reported discrepancies in an empirical implementation of split-step with the analytic tilt correlation. Finally, we outline a major limitation for Zernike-based simulation which still remains. ",

    "abstract": "Orientation-dependent etching is an interesting phenomenon which can be used for micro- and nano-scale texturing of silicon surfaces during black silicon production. We consider here the orientation-dependent plasma-less etching of silicon by molecular fluorine, which was previously established experimental. Moreover, this anisotropic process was implemented with atmospheric dry etching (ADE) technology. The nature of the anisotropy is that the etching in the (111) direction of the Si surface is significantly slower than that in the (100) and (110) directions. Using DFT (density functional theory) simulations, we performed quantum chemistry modelling of the reaction pathways determining the rates of the etching caused by F2 dissociative chemisorption and subsequent Si-Si bond breaking. Dangling bonds on the surface Si atoms were passivated with fluorine. A charge density analysis indicates that F atoms attracts electron density from the Si atoms giving them a positive charge, whereas the neighboring Si atoms unpassivated with fluorine have a negative charge. The amount of positive charge increases with the number of F atoms bonded with silicon. Si(100) and Si(110) incorporate a larger number of fluorine atoms than Si(111) resulting in the Si-Si bonds on these surfaces have a larger amount of positive charge. The lower reaction barrier and higher etch rate of Si(100) and Si(110) compared to Si(111) is explained by the fact that F2 molecule approaching the surface becomes negatively charged and more strongly attracts to the Si(100) and Si(110) surfaces than to the Si(111).

However, the intricate 4f-associated electronic transition in upconversion nanoparticles leads only to a weak photoluminescence intensity and unpolarized emission, hindering many applications that demand ultrabright and polarized light sources. Here, we uncover a new strategy for achieving ultrabright and dual-band polarized upconversion photoluminescence. We employ resonant dielectric metasurfaces supporting high-quality resonant modes at dual upconversion bands enabling two-order-of-magnitude amplification of upconversion emissions. We demonstrate that dual-band resonances can be selectively switched on polarization, endowing cross-polarization controlled upconversion luminescence with ultra-high degrees of polarization, reaching approximately 0.86 and 0.91 at dual emission wavelengths of 540 nm and 660 nm, respectively. Our strategy offers an effective approach for enhancing photon upconversion processes paving the way toward efficient low-threshold polarization upconversion lasers. ",

    "abstract": "Imaging systems operating in the terahertz part of the electromagnetic spectrum are in great demand because of the distinct characteristics of terahertz waves in penetrating many optically-opaque materials and providing unique spectral signatures of various chemicals. However, the use of terahertz imagers in real-world applications has been limited by the slow speed, large size, high cost, and complexity of the existing imaging systems. These limitations are mainly imposed due to the lack of terahertz focal-plane arrays (THz-FPAs) that can directly provide the frequency-resolved and/or time-resolved spatial information of the imaged objects. Here, we report the first THz-FPA that can directly provide the spatial amplitude and phase distributions, along with the ultrafast temporal and spectral information of an imaged object. It consists of a two-dimensional array of ~0.3 million plasmonic photoconductive nanoantennas optimized to rapidly detect broadband terahertz radiation with a high signal-to-noise ratio. As the first proof-of-concept, we utilized the multispectral nature of the amplitude and phase data captured by these plasmonic nanoantennas to realize pixel super-resolution imaging of objects. We successfully imaged and super-resolved etched patterns in a silicon substrate and reconstructed both the shape and depth of these structures with an effective number of pixels that exceeds 1-kilo pixels. By eliminating the need for raster scanning and spatial terahertz modulation, our THz-FPA offers more than a 1000-fold increase in the imaging speed compared to the state-of-the-art. Beyond this proof-of-concept super-resolution demonstration, the unique capabilities enabled by our plasmonic photoconductive THz-FPA offer transformative advances in a broad range of applications that use hyperspectral and three-dimensional terahertz images of objects for a wide range of applications.

We have shown that in the case of the wavelength dependence of magneto-optic activity parameter, new features appear in the optics of dichroic CLCs. We have shown that in this case new Dirac points appear, moreover, at some Dirac points photonic band gaps (PBGs) appear, at others, lines of magnetically induced transparency (MIT). In this case a polarization-sensitive transmission band appears too. At certain values of the helix pitch of the CLC and of the magnitude of the external magnetic field three PBGs of different nature appear, a transmittance band, two narrow lines of MIT and one broadband MIT. This system is non-reciprocal and the nonreciprocity changes over a wide range, it is observed both for reflection and transmittance and for absorption. The soft matter nature of CLCs and their response to external influences lead to easily tunable multifunctional devices that can find a variety of applications.

We show that by changing the molecular orientation with respect to the polarization of the cavity mode(s), the reaction can be selectively catalyzed to form a major 1,4-disubstituted or 1,5-disubstituted product.

Its clinical translation has been complicated by the need for modification of conventional OCT hardware to enable polarimetric measurements. Here, we present a signal processing method to reconstruct polarization properties of tissue from measurements with a single input polarization state, bypassing the need for modulation or multiplexing of input states. Our method relies on a polarization symmetry intrinsic to round-trip measurements and uses the residual spectral variation of the polarization states incident on the tissue to avoid measurement ambiguities. We demonstrate depth-resolved birefringence and optic axis orientation maps reconstructed from in-vivo data of human coronary arteries. We validate our method through comparison with conventional dual-input state measurements and find a mean cumulative retardance error of 13.2deg without observable bias. The 95% limit of agreement between depth-resolved birefringence is 2.80 x 10^(-4), which is less than the agreement between two repeat pullbacks of conventional PS-OCT (3.14 x 10^(-4)), indicating that the two methods can be used interchangeably. The hardware simplification arising from using a single input state may be decisive in realizing the potential of polarimetric measurements for assessing coronary atherosclerosis in clinical practice.

As the use of ML techniques in MRS continues to grow, this review aims to provide the MRS community with a structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we examine and summarize studies published between 2017 and 2023 from major journals in the magnetic resonance field. We categorize these studies based on a typical MRS workflow, including data acquisition, processing, analysis, and artificial data generation. Our review reveals that ML in MRS is still in its early stages, with a primary focus on processing and analysis techniques, and less attention given to data acquisition. We also found that many studies use similar model architectures, with little comparison to alternative architectures. Additionally, the generation of artificial data is a crucial topic, with no consistent method for its generation. Furthermore, many studies demonstrate that artificial data suffers from generalization issues when tested on in-vivo data. We also conclude that risks related to ML models should be addressed, particularly for clinical applications. Therefore, output uncertainty measures and model biases are critical to investigate. Nonetheless, the rapid development of ML in MRS and the promising results from the reviewed studies justify further research in this field. ",

Deep reservoir computers (deep-RC), in which the output of one reservoir is used as input of the next reservoir, can lead to improved performance because, as in other deep artificial neural networks, the successive layers represent the data in more and more abstract ways. We present a fiber-based photonic implementation of a two-layer deep-RC based on frequency multiplexing. The two RC layers are encoded in two frequency combs propagating in the same experimental setup. The connection between layers is fully analog and does not require any digital processing. We find that the deep-RC outperforms traditional RC by up to two orders of magnitude on two benchmark tasks. This work thus paves the way towards using fully analog photonic neuromorphic computing for complex processing of time series, while avoiding costly analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of aerodynamic forces in real-time is crucial for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper presents a data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of pressure sensors located on the surface of UAV. The model is built on a linear term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of the surface pressure distribution, where the basis is extracted from numerical simulation data and the basis coefficients are determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of sensor locations. Sensor placement is optimized using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Aerodynamic forces are computed by integrating the reconstructed surface pressure distribution. The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network (NN) that is trained to bridge the gap between the ground truth and the DEIM prediction, especially in the scenario where the DEIM model is constructed from simulation data with limited fidelity. A large network is not necessary for accurate correction as the linear model already captures the main dynamics of the surface pressure field, thus yielding an efficient DEIM+NN aerodynamic force prediction model. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a 2D NACA0015 airfoil, and numerical simulation data of dynamic stall of a 3D drone. Numerical results demonstrate that the machine learning enhanced model can make fast and accurate predictions of aerodynamic forces using only a few pressure sensors, even for the NACA0015 case in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore, the model is robust to noise. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the rotational properties of a two-dimensional self-bound quantum droplet, which is confined in a harmonic potential and compare them with the well-known problem of a single-component atomic gas, with contact interactions. For a fixed value of the trap frequency, choosing some representative values of the atom number, we determine the lowest-energy state, as the angular momentum increases. For a sufficiently small number of atoms, the angular momentum is carried via center-of-mass excitation. For larger values, when the angular momentum is sufficiently small, we observe vortex excitation, instead. Depending on the actual atom number, one, or more vortices enter the droplet. Beyond some critical value of the angular momentum, however, the droplet does not accommodate more vortices and the additional angular momentum is carried via center-of-mass excitation in a novel, \"mixed\" state. Finally, the excitation spectrum is also briefly discussed. ",

    "title": "Interfacing branching random walks with Metropolis sampling: constraint  release in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo",
    "abstract": "We present an approach to interface branching random walks with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, and to switch seamlessly between the two. The approach is discussed in the context of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) but is applicable to other Monte Carlo calculations or simulations. In AFQMC, the formulation of branching random walks along imaginary-time is needed to realize a constraint to control the sign or phase problem. The constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition, and is in practice implemented approximately with a trial wave function or trial density matrix, which can break exactness in the algorithm. We use the generalized Metropolis algorithm to sample a selected portion of the imaginary-time path after it has been produced by the branching random walk. This interfacing allows a constraint release to follow seamlessly from the constrained-path sampling, which can reduce the systematic error from the latter. It also provides a way to improve the computation of correlation functions and observables that do not commute with the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the method in atoms and molecules, where improvements in accuracy can be clearly quantified and near-exact results are obtained. We also discuss the computation of the variance of the Hamiltonian and propose a convenient way to evaluate it stochastically without changing the scaling of AFQMC. ",
