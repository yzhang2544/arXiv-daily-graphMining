    "abstract": "We demonstrate that a simple, unscanned polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography needle probe can be used to perform layer identification in biological tissues. Broadband light from a laser centered at 1310 nm was sent through a fiber that was embedded into a needle, and analysis of the polarization state of the returning light after interference coupled with Doppler-based tracking allowed the calculation of phase retardation and optic axis orientation at each needle location. Proof-of-concept phase retardation mapping was shown in Atlantic salmon tissue, while axis orientation mapping was demonstrated in white shrimp tissue. The needle probe was then tested on the ex vivo porcine spine, where mock epidural procedures were performed. Our imaging results demonstrate that unscanned, Doppler-tracked polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography imaging successfully identified the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and ligament layers, before successfully reaching the target of the epidural space. The addition of polarization-sensitive imaging into the bore of a needle probe therefore allows layer identification at deeper locations in the tissue. ",

    "abstract": "The inverse Faraday effect is a magneto-optical process allowing the magnetization of matter by an optical excitation carrying a non-zero spin of light. In particular, a right circular polarization generates a magnetization in the direction of light propagation and a left circular polarization in the opposite direction to this propagation. We demonstrate here that by manipulating the spin density of light, i.e., its polarization, in a plasmonic nanostructure, we generate a reversed inverse Faraday effect. A right circular polarization will generate a magnetization in the opposite direction of the light propagation, a left circular polarization in the direction of propagation. Also, we demonstrate that this new physical phenomenon is chiral, generating a strong magnetic field only for one helicity of the light, the opposite helicity producing this effect only for the mirror structure. This new optical concept opens the way to the generation of magnetic fields with unpolarized light, finding application in the ultrafast manipulation of magnetic domains and processes, such as spin precession, spin currents, and waves, magnetic skyrmion or magnetic circular dichroism, with direct applications in data storage and processing technologies.

    "abstract": "We present a novel technique to assess the focal volume of petawatt-class lasers at full power. Our approach exploits quantitative measurement of the angular distribution of electrons born in the focus via ionization of rarefied gas, which are accelerated forward and ejected ponderomotively by the field. We show that a bivariate ($\\theta, \\phi$) angular distribution, which was obtained with image plates, not only enables the peak intensity to be extracted, it also reflects nonideality of the focal-spot intensity distribution. In our prototype demonstration at intensities of a few $\\times 10^{19}$ to a few $\\times 10^{20}$ $\\mathrm{W/cm^2}$, an f/10 optic produced a focal spot in the paraxial regime, allowing a plane-wave parameterization of the peak intensity ($\\tan{\\theta} \\propto 1/a_0$) to be compared with our measurements; qualitative agreement was found. Furthermore, we show that scintillation detection of electrons is sensitive to real-time, shot-to-shot fluctuations, which means the technique would support single-shot measurement. Finally, we estimate that this approach should be usable with electrons up to intensities $\\sim 10^{21}\\ \\mathrm{W/cm^2}$ before angular measurements start to be less effective. However, angular measurements will again be possible at $\\sim 10^{24}\\ \\mathrm{W/cm^2}$ when protons become relativistic within a single cycle. ",

    "abstract": "Several ways to electronically synchronize different types of amplified femtosecond laser systems are presented, based on a single freely programmable electronics hardware: Arbitrary-detuning asynchronous optical sampling, as well as actively locking two femtosecond laser oscillators, albeit not necessarily to the same round-trip frequency. They allow us to rapidly probe a very wide range of timescales, from picoseconds to potentially seconds, in a single transient absorption experiment without the need to move any delay stage. Experiments become possible that address a largely unexplored aspect of many photochemical reactions, in particular in the context of photo-catalysis as well as photoactive proteins, where an initial femtosecond trigger very often initiates a long-lasting cascade of follow-up processes. The approach is very versatile, and allows us to synchronize very different lasers, such as a Ti:Sa amplifier and a 100~kHz Yb-laser system. The jitter of the synchronisation, and therewith the time-resolution in the transient experiment, lies in the range from 1~ps to 3~ps, depending on the method. For illustration, transient IR measurements of the excited state solvation and decay of a metal carbonyl complex as well as the full reaction cycle of bacteriorhodopsin are shown. The pros and cons of the various methods are discussed, with regard to the scientific question one might want to address, and also with regard to the laser systems that might be already existent in a laser lab.

In particular we reduce the polarizability of $52P_{3/2}$ states which have resonances at 5.35 GHz to $51D_{5/2}$, suitable for interfacing Rydberg atoms to superconducting resonators in a cryogenic environment. We measure the polarizability of the Rydberg states using Magneto-Optical-Trap (MOT) loss spectroscopy. Using an off-resonant radio-frequency (RF) dressing field coupling $52P_{3/2}$ and $51D_{5/2}$ we demonstrate a reduction in dc polarizability of the $ 52P_{3/2}$ states over 80$\\%$. Experimental findings are in good agreement with a numerical model of the atom-dressing field system developed using the Shirley-Floquet formalism. We also demonstrate that the dc polarizability reduction is highly anisotropic, with near total nulling possible when the dc and dressing fields are aligned, but only a factor of two reduction in polarizability when the fields are orthogonal. These results may aid in stabilizing Rydberg resonances against varying dc fields present near surfaces, enabling advancement in the development of hybrid Rydberg atom - superconducting resonator quantum gates.

I show that while indeed the same physical mechanism underpins both PTC and OPA , the difference arises from the boundary conditions. Thus , while dispersion for both PTC and OPA exhibit the same bandgap in momentum space, only in the case of PTC can one have propagation in that bandgap with exponential amplification. I also show that PTC can be engineered with both second and third order nonlinearities, and that rather unexpectedly, modulating permittivity on the ultrafast (few fs) rate is not a necessity, and that one can emulate all the PTC features using materials with a few picoseconds response time commensurate with the propagation time through the medium.

    "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoTs) invokes increasing security demands that require robust encryption or anti-counterfeiting technologies. Albeit being acknowledged as efficacious solutions in processing elaborate graphical information via multiple degrees of freedom, optical data encryption and anti-counterfeiting techniques are typically inept in delivering satisfactory performance without compromising the desired ease-of-processibility or compatibility, thus leading to the exploration of novel materials and devices that are competent. Here, a robust optical data encryption technique is demonstrated utilizing polymer-stabilized-liquid-crystals (PSLCs) combined with projection photoalignment and photopatterning methods. The PSLCs possess implicit optical patterns encoded via photoalignment, as well as explicit geometries produced via photopatterning. Furthermore, the PSLCs demonstrate improved robustness against harsh chemical environments and thermal stability, and can be directly deployed onto various rigid and flexible substrates. Based on this, it is demonstrated that single PSLC is apt to carry intricate information, or serve as exclusive watermark with both implicit features and explicit geometries. Moreover, a novel, generalized design strategy is developed, for the first time, to encode intricate and exclusive information with enhanced security by spatially programming the photoalignment patterns of a pair of cascade PSLCs, which further illustrates the promising capabilies of PSLCs in optical data encryption and anti-counterfeiting.

Despite remarkable advances using ultracold atomic platforms combining atomic interactions with spatially disordered lattices, many-body effects on quantum transport phenomena in high-dimensional disordered systems, such as the three-dimensional (d = 3) Anderson metal-insulator transition (MIT), have largely remained unexplored. Here we utilize a momentum space lattice platform using quasi-periodically kicked ultracold atomic gases as a quantum simulator to experimentally investigate the role of many-body interactions in the d = 3 Anderson MIT. We observe interaction-driven sub-diffusive delocalization and find a divergence of the delocalization onset time as kick strength approaches the many-body phase boundary. By modifying the kick quasi-periodicity, we demonstrate interaction-driven sub-diffusion in d = 2 and d = 4. Our numerical simulations using a mean-field treatment exhibit an interaction-induced shift of the d = 3 transition boundary and many-body delocalization dynamics, that are both in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. However, there are significant quantitative deviations between experiment and mean-field theory which increase with higher interaction strengths, calling for further study of the underlying many-body physics.

Spatial quantum superpositions have so far been tested only with small systems, from photons and elementary particles to atoms and molecules. Such superpositions for massive objects have been a long-standing sought-after goal. This is important not only in order to confirm quantum theory in new regimes, but also in order to probe the quantum-gravity interface. In addition, such an experiment will enable to test exotic theories, and may even enable new technology. Creating such superpositions is notoriously hard because of environmental decoherence, whereby the large object couples strongly to the environment which turns the delicate quantum state into a statistical mixture (classical state). However, advances in the technology of isolation could in future suppress such decoherence. Here we present a decoherence channel which is not external but internal to the object, and consequently improved isolation would not help. This channel originates from the phonons (sound waves) within the object. We show that such phonons are excited as part of any splitting process, and thus we establish a fundamental and universal limit on the possibility of future spatial quantum superpositions with massive objects.

Here, we investigate DL-based DFTs for random quantum Ising chains, both with nearest-neighbor and up to next-nearest neighbor couplings. Our neural functionals are trained and tested on data produced via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, exact diagonalization, and tensor-network methods. An economical gradient-descent optimization is used to find the ground-state properties of previously unseen Hamiltonian instances. Notably, our non-local functionals drastically improve upon the common local density approximations, and they are designed to be scalable, allowing us to simulate chain sizes much larger than those used for training. The prediction accuracy is analyzed, paying attention to the spatial correlations of the learned functionals and to the role of quantum criticality.
