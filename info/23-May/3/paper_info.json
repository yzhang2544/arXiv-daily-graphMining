Having a solid foundation in these conceptual ideas is critical for educators who will be adopting quantum ideas within the classroom. Yet they are some of the most difficult concepts to master. We show how one can systematically develop these conceptual foundations with thought experiments on light and with thought experiments that employ the Stern-Gerlach experiment. We emphasize the importance of computer animations in aiding the instruction on these concepts. ",

    "abstract": "Spintronic terahertz emitters promise terahertz sources with an unmatched broad frequency bandwidth that are easy to fabricate and operate, and therefore easy to scale at low cost. However, current experiments and proofs of concept rely on free-space ultrafast pump lasers and rather complex benchtop setups. This contrasts with the requirements of widespread industrial applications, where robust, compact, and safe designs are needed. To meet these requirements, we present a novel fiber-tip spintronic terahertz emitter solution that allows spintronic terahertz systems to be fully fiber-coupled. Using single-mode fiber waveguiding, the newly developed solution naturally leads to a simple and straightforward terahertz near-field imaging system with a 90%-10% knife-edge-response spatial resolution of 30 ${\\mu}m$.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the use of a low power near-infrared laser illuminating the front facet of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) as an optical actuator for the coherent control of a mid-infrared frequency comb. We show that by appropriate current control of the QCL comb and intensity modulation of the near-infrared laser, a tight phase lock of a comb line to a distributed feedback laser is possible with 2 MHz of locking bandwidth and 200 mrad of residual phase noise. A characterization of the whole scheme is provided showing the limits of the electrical actuation which we bypassed using the optical actuation. Both comb degrees of freedom can be locked by performing electrical injection locking of the repetition rate in parallel. However, we show that the QCL acts as a fast near-infrared light detector such that injection locking can also be achieved through modulation of the near-infrared light. These results on the coherent control of a quantum cascade laser frequency comb are particularly interesting for coherent averaging in dual-comb spectroscopy and for mid-infrared frequency comb applications requiring high spectral purity.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets and the landing applications of deep learning are recent research hotspots. In this work, we propose a novel time piecewise physical-informed neural networks (PINNs) to study complex dynamics on the one-dimensional quantum droplets by solving the corresponding amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The training effect of this network framework in the long time domain is far better than that of the conventional PINNs, and each of its subnetworks is independent and highly adjustable. By using time piecewise PINNs with scarce training points, we not only study intrinsic excitations in a single droplet and collision between two droplets, but also excite the breathers on droplet background. Intriguingly, we obtain an interference pattern from training result of collision between two droplets, which is a significant feature of the interplay of coherent matter waves. The numerical results showcase that different parameters may lead to completely different dynamic behaviors under the same initial condition in a nonlinear non-integrable system. Our results provide the significant guidance for intrinsic excitations of single droplet, droplet collision and breathers excitation via deep learning technology. ",

While the $n$-th R\\'enyi entropy can be computed using the replica method in the path integral representation of quantum field theory, the analytic continuation can only be achieved for some simple systems on a case-by-case basis. In this work, we propose a general framework to tackle this problem using classical and quantum neural networks with supervised learning. We begin by studying several examples with known von Neumann entropy, where the input data is generated by representing $\\text{Tr} \\rho_A^n$ with a generating function. We adopt KerasTuner to determine the optimal network architecture and hyperparameters with limited data. In addition, we frame a similar problem in terms of quantum machine learning models, where the expressivity of the quantum models for the entanglement entropy as a partial Fourier series is established. Our proposed methods can accurately predict the von Neumann and R\\'enyi entropies numerically, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques for solving problems in quantum information theory.

    "abstract": "Trapped ions are one of the leading candidates for scalable and long-distance quantum networks because of their long qubit coherence time, high fidelity single- and two-qubit gates, and their ability to generate photons entangled with the qubit state of the ion. One method for creating ion-photon entanglement is to exploit optically transitions from the P_(1/2) to S_(1/2) levels, which naturally emit spin-photon entangled states. But these optical transitions typically lie in the ultra-violet and visible wavelength regimes. These wavelengths exhibit significant fiber-optic propagation loss, thereby limiting the transfer of quantum information to tens of meters. Quantum frequency conversion is essential to convert these photons to telecom wavelengths so that they can propagate over long distances in fiber-based networks, as well as for compatibility with the vast number of telecom-based opto-electronic components. Here, we generate O-band telecom photons via a low noise quantum frequency conversion scheme from photons emitted from the P_(1/2) to S_(1/2) dipole transition of a trapped barium ion. We use a two-stage quantum frequency conversion scheme to achieve a frequency shift of 375.4 THz between the input visible photon and the output telecom photon achieving a conversion efficiency of 11%. We attain a signal-to-background ratio of over 100 for the converted O-band telecom photon with background noise less than 15 counts/sec. These results are an important step toward achieving trapped ion quantum networks over long distances for distributed quantum computing and quantum communication. ",

    "abstract": "A bath with a negative temperature is a subject of intense debate in recent times. It raises fundamental questions not only on our understanding of negative temperature of a bath in connection with thermodynamics but also on the possibilities of constructing devices using such baths. In this work, we study steady-state quantum thermodynamics involving baths with negative temperatures. A bath with a negative temperature is created synthetically using two baths of positive temperatures and weakly coupling these with a qutrit system. These baths are then coupled to each other via a working system. At steady-state, the laws of thermodynamics are analyzed. We find that whenever the temperatures of these synthetic baths are identical, there is no heat flow, which reaffirms the zeroth law. There is always a spontaneous heat flow for different temperatures. In particular, heat flows from a bath with a negative temperature to a bath with a positive temperature which, in turn, implies that a bath with a negative temperature is `hotter' than a bath with a positive temperature. This warrants an amendment in the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law, as suggested in earlier studies. In all these processes, the overall entropy production is positive, as required by the Clausius statement of the second law. We construct continuous heat engines operating between positive and negative temperature baths. These engines yield maximum possible heat-to-work conversion efficiency, that is, unity. We also study the thermodynamic nature of heat from a bath with a negative temperature and find that it is thermodynamic work but with negative entropy. ",
