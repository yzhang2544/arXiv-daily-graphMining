    "abstract": "           Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.

Recently, we proposed to use sapphire as a high-performance PIC platform, which enables a fully integrated solution to include a complete set of components with light source, modulator, light detection, passive devices, silicon on sapphire control circuit all-in-one sapphire platform to achieve high-performance low-cost mixed-signal optical links. In parallel to developing ac-tive components such as group III-V lasers on sapphire, in this work, the performance of group III-V straight waveguides on sapphire was systemically studied. The refractive indices contrast between GaAs, InP, GaSb, and sapphire are sufficiently high to achieve low loss over a broad optical wavelength. The calculated loss at wavelengths of 1330 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm for the GaAs, InP, and GaSb rib waveguides are 0.32 dB/cm, 0.67 dB/cm, and 0.70 dB/cm, re-spectively. Since the fundamental element to construct all passive building blocks is the straight waveguide, results from this work would allow us to assess other basic passive building blocks.         ",

Here, we leverage the natural geometry of fibre to build a scalable photonic Chern insulator by twisting the fibre during fabrication. The twist inside optical fibre breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and induces a pseudo-magnetic field, which we observe via photonic Landau levels. Unavoidably, this twist introduces a competing topology-destroying effect through a parabolic profile in the effective refractive index. Using simulations to guide experimental materials design, we discover the Goldilocks regime where the real-space Chern invariant survives, guaranteeing topological protection against fabrication-induced disorder of any symmetry class.

The performance of our methodology is evaluated by its ability to estimate the source's location within a given time frame. To test the robustness and practical applications of the methods under real-world conditions, we deployed an advanced distributed sensors network to gather water vapor data from a controlled source.

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a {\\delta}-function in time. We present exact calculations using the phase-cycling method without making the aforementioned approximations. We introduce a generalized version of the phase-cycling method to isolate an arbitrary N-wave mixing signal. We then apply this method to model the saturation of the nonlinear signal from excitons in semiconductor quantum wells, which is consistent with 2DCS experiments. We also present simulation results that replicate previously-reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signal, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation.

Merging multiple BICs in the momentum space could further enhance the Q-factor as well as its robustness to fabrication imperfections. Here, we report doubly-degenerate guided mode resonances (GMR) in a resonant metasurface, whose radiation losses could be totally suppressed due to merging BICs. We show that the GMRs and their associated accidental BICs can be evolved into degenerate merging BICs by parametric tuning of the metasurface. Significantly, these two GMRs share the same critical parameter (i.e. lattice constants or thickness) that the merging BICs occur. Interestingly, thanks to the degenerate property of two GMRs, a larger (smaller) period will split one of merging BICs into eight accidental BICs at off-{\\Gamma} point, but annihilate the other. Such exotic phenomenon can be well explained from the interaction of GMRs and background Fabry-Perot resonances.

    "abstract": "           Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect.

Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1 - 2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2 - 4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d electron filling on IFE.

Among them are quantum light sources providing deterministic, high brightness, high-fidelity entangled photons and quantum memories with coherence times in the millisecond range and above. To operate the network on a global scale, the quantum light source should emit at telecommunication wavelengths with minimum propagation losses. A cornerstone for the operation of such a quantum network is the demonstration of quantum teleportation. Here we realize full-photonic quantum teleportation employing one of the most promising platforms, i.e. semiconductor quantum dots, which can fulfill all the aforementioned requirements. Two remote quantum dots are used, one as a source of entangled photon pairs and the other as a single-photon source. The frequency mismatch between the triggered sources is erased using two polarization-preserving quantum frequency converters, enabling a Bell state measurement at telecommunication wavelengths. A post-selected teleportation fidelity of up to 0.721(33) is achieved, significantly above the classical limit, demonstrating successful quantum teleportation between light generated by distinct sources. These results mark a major advance for the semiconductor platform as a source of quantum light fulfilling a key requirement for a scalable quantum network. This becomes particularly relevant after the seminal breakthrough of addressing a nuclear spin in semiconductor quantum dots demonstrating long coherence times, thus fulfilling another crucial step towards a scalable quantum network.

We focus on the first-order coherence of the simplest possible light field, a purely monochromatic plane wave, which is classically completely stable. Starting from a scalar treatment, we show that the field displays zero coherence uncertainty only for a number state. We then proceed to the vectorial regime and establish that any state leads to coherence fluctuations, governed by a set of uncertainty relations depending on the polarization state and space-time points. Our work thus provides fundamental insights into the quantum character of optical coherence, with potential benefits in applications using highly sensitive interferometric and polarimetric techniques.

Specifically, we discover the emergence of a cluster phenomenon in rankings considering the rotation phases, i.e. the existence of similar clusters in the distribution of the rankings and their fidelity with the corresponding classical PageRanks, the ranking distribution variance, the coherence and entanglement of PageRank states, and the power law parameter in the ranking distributions on a scale-free network concerning the two rotation phases. Furthermore, we propose an alternate quantum PageRank with APR which provides an extra tunnel for the analysis of PageRank. We also study the PageRank on the trackback graph of a scale-free graph for the investigation of network information traffic tracking. We demonstrate the rich cluster diversity formed in our alternate quantum PageRank, which offers a novel perspective on the quantum versatility of PageRank. Our results present the quantum-enabled perspective for PageRanking and shed light on the design and application of practical quantum PageRank algorithms.         ",

The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Most model reduction methods are space-only in that they reduce the spatial dimension of the solution but not the temporal one. These methods integrate an encoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We propose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations for the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval $[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of degrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal correlations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only one. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an algebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution, as well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the method consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the initial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a $1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes and CPU time for all of our tests. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any space-only Petrov-Galerkin method.

In particular, Floquet systems with a periodic time modulation are currently of considerable interest. Here, we demonstrate how the scattering properties of a finite Floquet medium can be correctly described by a static Floquet scattering matrix, which satisfies a pseudounitary relation. This algebraic property is a consequence of the conservation of wave action for which we formulate here a continuity equation. Using this Floquet scattering matrix, we further demonstrate how it can be used to transfer concepts for wavefront-shaping based on the Wigner-Smith operator from static to Floquet systems. The eigenstates of the corresponding Floquet Wigner-Smith matrix are shown to be light pulses that are optimally shaped in both their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom for the optical micromanipulation of time-varying media.

Quantitatively, by using a deep-subwavelength-confined 0.4-THz 1-ps pulsed driving field and a 3-MeV 1-fs electron bunch, we obtain a $\\sim$ 0.1-cycle femtosecond pulse with a peak frequency of $\\sim$ 26 THz ($\\sim$ 38 fs in optical cycle) and a pulse width of $\\sim$ 3.6 fs; with the same driving field and a 30-MeV 50-as electron bunch, we obtain a 0.17-cycle attosecond pulse with a peak frequency of $\\sim$ 2.0 PHz ($\\sim$ 500 as in optical cycle) and a pulse width of $\\sim$ 86 as.

However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of <2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\u00e9 optical skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster that is either crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\u00e9 optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.         ",

The traditional standing bulk wave method can realize the particle manipulation in deep solutions, but it cannot work properly for particle manipulation within a long distance due to the energy loss. In this work, the topological rainbow defect-state trapping is realized, the results show that an effect of point accumulation of acoustic pressure in the waveguide path exists, the position of maximum acoustic pressure can be adjusted flexibly by changing the frequency of the incident acoustic wave, based on which, long-distance movement and capture manipulations of particles in deep solution have been realized.

While many protocols were realized, and even commercialized, the throughput and processing speed of current protocols is limited by the narrow electronic bandwidth of standard measurement devices (typically in the MHz-to-GHz range), which is orders-of-magnitude lower than the optical bandwidth of available quantum optical sources (10-100 THz), indicating that the bandwidth resource is dramatically underutilized in current quantum optical technology. We present a general concept of frequency multiplexed quantum channels and a set of methods to process quantum information efficiently across the available optical bandwidth. Using a broadband source of squeezed light, spectral manipulation methods and parametric homodyne detection, we are able to generate, process and measure all the channels in parallel, thereby harnessing the optical bandwidth for quantum information in an efficient manner. We exemplify the concept through two basic protocols: Multiplexed Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and multiplexed continuous-variable quantum teleportation. The multiplexed QKD protocol is demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment, where we successfully carry out QKD over 23 uncorrelated spectral channels, with capability to detect eavesdropping in any channel. These multiplexed methods (and similar) will enable to carry out quantum processing in parallel over hundreds of channels, potentially increasing the throughput of quantum protocols by orders of magnitude.

The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion.

We extend the utility of this technique to inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability profiles by proposing a dynamical formulation of the scattering of TE and TM waves in which the transfer matrix for the medium is given in terms of the evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. This leads to a system of dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Decoupling these equations we reduce the solution of the scattering problem for TE and TM modes to that of an initial-value problem for a Riccati equation.

We explore and implement two independent methods to accomplish these tasks, which enable one to directly compute the Kossakowski matrix of an arbitrary Markovian QME from its Liouvillian. In the first method, due to Hall, Cresser, Li, and Andersson, the Kossakowski matrix elements are obtained by evaluating the action of the Liouvillian on the orthonormal SU($N$) basis matrices and then computing a sum of matrix-product traces. The second method, developed in this work, is based on the real $N$-level coherence vector and relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. We show that both methods give identical results, and apply them to establish the complete positivity of the partial secular Bloch-Redfield QME for the $\\Lambda$ and V-systems driven by incoherent light. We find that the eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix of these seemingly different three-level systems are identical, implying close similarities of their dissipative dynamics. By facilitating the expression of multilevel Markovian QMEs in Lindblad form, our results enable testing the QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, as well as restoring complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.
