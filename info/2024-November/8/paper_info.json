    "abstract": "           The rapid growth in artificial intelligence and modern communication systems demands innovative solutions for increased computational power and advanced signaling capabilities. Integrated photonics, leveraging the analog nature of electromagnetic waves at the chip scale, offers a promising complement to approaches based on digital electronics. To fully unlock their potential as analog processors, establishing a common technological base between conventional digital electronic systems and analog photonics is imperative to building next-generation computing and communications hardware. However, the absence of an efficient interface has critically challenged comprehensive demonstrations of analog advantage thus far, with the scalability, speed, and energy consumption as primary bottlenecks. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate a general electro-optic digital-to-analog link (EO-DiAL) enabled by foundry-based lithium niobate nanophotonics. Using purely digital inputs, we achieve on-demand generation of (i) optical and (ii) electronic waveforms at information rates up to 186 Gbit/s. The former addresses the digital-to-analog electro-optic conversion challenge in photonic computing, showcasing high-fidelity MNIST encoding while consuming 0.058 pJ/bit. The latter enables a pulse-shaping-free microwave arbitrary waveform generation method with ultrabroadband tunable delay and gain. Our results pave the way for efficient and compact digital-to-analog conversion paradigms enabled by integrated photonics and underscore the transformative impact analog photonic hardware may have on various applications, such as computing, optical interconnects, and high-speed ranging.

    "abstract": "           Unitarity serves as a fundamental concept for characterizing linear and conservative wave phenomena in both classical and quantum systems. Developing platforms that perform unitary operations on light waves in a uni-versal and programmable manner enables the emulation of complex light-matter interactions and the execution of general-purpose functionalities for wave manipulations, photonic computing, and quantum circuits. Recent-ly, numerous approaches to implementing programmable photonic unitary circuits have been proposed and demonstrated, each employing different design strategies that distinctly impact overall device performance. Here, we review foundational design principles and recent achievements in the implementation of programma-ble photonic unitary circuits, with a particular focus on integrated photonic platforms. We classify the design strategies based on the dimensionality of nontrivial unit operations in their building blocks: lower-dimensional unitary units, such as SU(2) operations, and higher-dimensional ones, such as Fourier transforms. In each cate-gory, recent efforts to leverage alternative physical axes, such as the temporal and frequency domains, to ad-dress scalability challenges are also reviewed. We discuss the underlying concepts, design procedures, and trade-offs of each design strategy, especially in relation to light-based computing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Probing and manipulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of hot carriers in nanoscale metals is crucial to a plethora of applications ranging from nonlinear nanophotonics to single molecule photochemistry. The direct investigation of these highly non-equilibrium carriers requires the experimental capability of high energy resolution (~ meV) broadband femtosecond spectroscopy. When considering the ultimate limits of atomic scale structures, this capability has remained out of reach until date. Using a two color femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, we present here the real-time tracking of hot carrier dynamics in a well-defined plasmonic picocavity, formed in the tunnel junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The excitation of hot carriers in the picocavity enables ultrafast all optical control over the broadband (~ eV) anti Stokes electronic resonance Raman scattering (ERRS) and the four-wave mixing (FWM) signals generated at the atomic length scale. By mapping the ERRS and FWM signals from a single graphene nanoribbon (GNR), we demonstrate that both signals are more efficiently generated along the edges of the GNR: a manifestation of atomic-scale nonlinear optical microscopy. This demonstration paves the way to the development of novel ultrafast nonlinear picophotonic platforms, affording unique opportunities in a variety of contexts, from the direct investigation of non equilibrium light matter interactions in complex quantum materials, to the development of robust strategies for hot carriers harvesting in single molecules and the next generation of active metasurfaces with deep-sub-wavelength meta-atoms.

    "abstract": "           Driving the nuclear fusion reaction p+11B -> 3 alpha + 8.7 MeV in laboratory conditions, by interaction between high-power laser pulses and matter, has become a popular field of research, due to numerous applications that it can potentially allow: an alternative to deuterium-tritium (DT) for fusion energy production, astrophysics studies and alpha-particle generation for medical treatments. A possible scheme for laser-driven p-11B reactions is to direct a beam of laser-accelerated protons onto a boron sample (the so-called 'pitcher-catcher' scheme). This technique was successfully implemented on large, energetic lasers, yielding hundreds of joules per shot at low repetition. We present here a complementary approach, exploiting the high-repetition rate of the VEGA III petawatt laser at CLPU (Spain), aiming at accumulating results from many interactions at much lower energy, for better controlling the parameters and the statistics of the measurements. Despite a moderate energy per pulse, our experiment allowed exploring the laser-driven fusion process with tens (up to hundreds) of laser shots. The experiment provided a clear signature of the produced reactions and of the fusion products, accumulated over many shots, leading to an improved optimization of the diagnostic for these experimental campaigns In this paper we discuss the effectiveness of the laser-driven p-11B fusion in the pitcher-catcher scheme, at high-repetition rate, addressing the challenges of this experimental scheme and highlighting its critical aspects. Our proposed methodologies allow evaluating the performance of this scheme for laser-driven alpha particle production and can be adapted to high-repetition rate laser facilities with higher energy and intensity.

However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

    "abstract": "           Topological properties of photonic structures described by Hamiltonian matrices have been extensively studied in recent years. Photonic systems are often open systems, and their coupling with the environment is characterized by scattering matrices, which can exhibit topological features as well. In this work, we uncover that topological singularities can be manifested in the scattering matrices of two-dimensional periodic photonic systems with open boundaries in the third dimension, introducing a new topological approach to describe scattering. We elaborate the importance of symmetry and demonstrate that mirror symmetry gives rise to the formation of diabolic points and nodal lines in the three-dimensional frequency-momentum space, which transform into exceptional points and lines in the presence of material loss. These topological features in the eigenvalue structure of the scattering matrix manifest as vortex lines in the cross-polarization scattering phase, providing a direct link between the eigen-problem and observable scattering phenomena in the frequency-momentum space. We demonstrate these phenomena numerically and experimentally using a reflective non-local metasurface. These findings extend the concept of topological singularities to scattering matrices and pave the way for novel photonic devices and wavefront engineering techniques.         ",

However, conventional photonic devices face substantial challenges in achieving efficient conversion due to the limited overlap between acoustic waves and optical waves. In this study, we address this limitation by demonstrating an enhanced conversion effect of photonic crystal nanobeam cavities (PCNBCs) in AO modulation on a polymer-loaded lithium niobate integrated platform. Attributed to the high ratio of quality factor (Q) to mode volume (V) and optimal light-sound overlap within the nanocavity, PCNBCs-based AO modulator exhibits a significantly enhanced extinction ratio of 38 dB with a threshold RF power below -50 dBm, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that based on micro-ring resonator (MRRs). In addition, robust digital amplitude shift keying modulations using selected RF and optical channels of the PCNBCs-enhanced AO modulators. These findings validate the compelling properties of the PCNBCs photonic platform, establishing it as a promising candidate for on-chip integrated microwave photonics, optical transceivers, and computing applications.

In quadratic media, we reveal that a two-color Peregrine rogue wave can resonantly radiate dispersive waves even in the absence of higher-order dispersion, subjected to a phase-matching mechanism that involves the second harmonic wave, and to a concomitant difference-frequency generation process.

We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           A wavepacket (electromagnetic or otherwise) within an isotropic and homogeneous space can be quantized on a regular lattice of discrete k-vectors. Each k-vector is associated with a temporal frequency omega; together, k and omega represent a propagating plane-wave. While the total energy and total linear momentum of the packet can be readily apportioned among its individual plane-wave constituents, the same cannot be said about the packet's total angular momentum. One can show, in the case of a reasonably smooth (i.e., continuous and differentiable) wave packet, that the overall angular momentum is expressible as an integral over the k-space continuum involving only the Fourier transform of the field and its k-space gradients. In this sense, the angular momentum is a property not of individual plane-waves, but of plane-wave pairs that are adjacent neighbors in the space inhabited by the k-vectors, and can be said to be localized in the k-space. Strange as it might seem, this hallmark property of angular momentum does not automatically emerge from an analysis of a discretized k-space. In fact, the discrete analysis shows the angular momentum to be distributed among k-vectors that pair not only with nearby k-vectors but also with those that are far away. The goal of the present paper is to resolve the discrepancy between the discrete calculations and those performed on the continuum, by establishing the conditions under which the highly non-local sum over plane-wave pairs in the discrete k-space would approach the localized distribution of the angular momentum across the continuum of the k-space.

    "abstract": "           Self-injection locking (SIL) of laser diodes to microresonators is a powerful technique that enables compact narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we extend this technique to chip-integrated Fabry-Perot microresonators, which offer high-quality factors and large mode volumes in a compact footprint, reducing fundamental thermo-refractive noise. The resonators consist of a silicon nitride waveguide terminated by two photonic crystal reflectors fabricated via scalable ultraviolet lithography. Evanescent side-coupling allows precise tuning of the SIL feedback mechanism. We present a theoretical model and experimentally demonstrate SIL, resulting in a fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited laser. We achieve excellent agreement between the experimental results and theoretical model. These results complement current SIL techniques and are relevant to chip-scale low-noise laser systems.

    "title": "Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications",
    "abstract": "           Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650\u00b0C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.

    "title": "Representing Domain-Mixing Optical Degradation for Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Vector Quantization",
    "abstract": "           Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target optical degradation domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. Centering around representing and quantizing the optical degradation which is consistent across different images, QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) characterizing the optical degradation; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts.

    "abstract": "           The quantum interaction between free electrons and photons is fundamental to free-electron based light sources and free-electron quantum optics applications. A large coupling between free electrons and photons is generally desired. In this manuscript, I obtain the upper bound for the quantum coupling between free electrons and photons. The upper bound has a straightforward expression and can be applied to a broad range of optical materials, especially widely used low-loss photonic materials. The upper bound depends on the optical medium, the free-electron velocity, and the separation between the free electron and the optical medium. With simple structures, the numerically calculated coupling coefficient can reach ~99% of the upper bound. This study provides simple and practical guidance to reach the strong coupling between free electrons and photons.         ",

In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. Furthermore, we explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.

Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric \"split-post\" configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.
