    "abstract": "           The ability to concentrate sound energy with a tunable focal point is essential for a wide range of acoustic applications, offering precise control over the location and intensity of sound pressure maxima. However, conventional acoustic metalenses are typically passive, with fixed focal positions, limiting their versatility. A significant obstacle in achieving tunable sound wave focusing lies in the complexity of precise and programmable adjustments, which often require intricate mechanical or electronic systems. In this study, we present a theoretical and experimental investigation of a reconfigurable acoustic metalens based on a bistable origami design. The metalens comprises eight flexible origami units, each capable of switching between two stable equilibrium states, enabling local modulation of sound waves through two distinct reflection phases. The metalens can be locked into specific symmetric or asymmetric configurations by manually tailoring the origami units to settle either of the two states. Each configuration generates a unique phase profile, focusing sound energy at a specific point. This concept allows the focal spot to be dynamically reconfigured both on and off-axis. Furthermore, the approach introduces a simple yet effective mechanism for tuning sound energy concentration, offering a solution for flexible acoustic manipulation.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.         ",

    "abstract": "           The concept of skyrmions was introduced as early as the 1960s by Tony Skyrme. The topologically protected configuration embedded in skyrmions has prompted some investigations into their fundamental properties and versatile applications, sparking interest and guiding ongoing development. The topological protection associated with skyrmions was initially observed in systems with interactions. It is widely believed that skyrmions are stable yet relevant confirmation and empirical research remains limited. A pertinent question is whether skyrmion configurations formed by single-particle wave functions also exhibit topological stability. In this study, we affirm this hypothesis by investigating the effects of local decoherence. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the topological resilience of skyrmions and occurrence of transition points of skyrmion numbers in local decoherence of three typical decoherence channels. On the other hand, we show that these qualities are independent of the initial state. From the numerical results, we verify that inhomogeneous but continuous decoherence channels also adhere to the same behaviors and hold topological stability of skyrmions as homogeneous decoherence channels. These properties of skyrmions contribute to further applications in various areas including communication and imaging.         ",

Specific conditions are required for TRIBs formation. At the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, a new method is developed to improve the dynamic and momentum apertures in a 6-GeV lattice as well as to preserve the conditions for TRIBs formation. This method reduces the dimension of variables from 76 sextupoles to 8 group variables and then utilizes the robust conjugate direction search algorithm in optimization. Created with a few harmonic sextupoles or octupoles, several knobs that can either rotate the TRIBs in phase space or adjust the actions of SFPs are discussed and demonstrated by both tracking simulations and experimental results. In addition, a new scheme to drive all particles into one single island is described. Possible applications using TRIBs in accelerators are also discussed.         ",

The rotation of a general beam is characterized by observing the rotational behavior of the directions of the extreme spot sizes during propagation. We introduce the beam quality $M^2(\\psi)$ factor to characterize the unique beam quality of a general beam across all directions, not limited to the $x$- or $y$-axes. Besides that, we present the beam center $s_{\\psi}(\\psi,z)$, spot size $w_{\\psi}(\\psi,z)$, waist position, waist radius, and divergence angle along the direction that forms an angle $\\psi$ with the $x$-axis in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis for the general beam. Furthermore, this paper presents rapid calculation formulas for these parameters, utilizing the mode expansion method (MEM). Subsequently, we prove that only two extreme spot sizes exist in a given detection plane and the angle between the maximum and minimum spot angles is consistently $90^{\\circ}$ during the propagation. We also prove the spot rotation angles converge as $z$ approaches either positive or negative infinity. We first show the extreme spot sizes, spot rotation angle, and angular speed for the vortex beam. Our formulas efficiently differentiate between vortex OAM beams and asymmetry OAM beams.         ",

However, a major challenge in implementing curvilinear ILT for large-scale production is mask rule checking, an area currently under development by foundries and EDA vendors. Although recent research has incorporated mask complexity into the optimization process, much of it focuses on reducing e-beam shots, which does not align with the goals of curvilinear ILT. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated ILT algorithm that improves not only contour quality and process window but also the precision of curvilinear mask shapes.

    "abstract": "           Objective: Ensuring the precision in motion tracking for MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is crucial for the delivery of effective treatments. This study refined the motion tracking accuracy in MRIgRT through the innovation of an automatic real-time tracking method, leveraging an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework coupled with automatic segmentation. Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking method by integrating two primary methods: the ETLD framework and an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The TLD framework was upgraded to suit real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. Additionally, ICV was combined for precise coverage of the target volume, which refined the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. Tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases, our method ensures precise tracking and accurate segmentation vital for MRIgRT. Results: An evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions revealed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects, underscoring the robustness and efficacy of the ETLD. Moreover, the ETLD+ICV yielded a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the proposed method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusions: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time motion tracking method for MRIgRT that markedly surpasses current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also demonstrates enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, positioning it as an indispensable asset in the quest to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.

From the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), we simulate systems with 4, 8, and 16 spins arranged in square lattices, generating extensive datasets with 5000 samples per magnetic field value. The Hamiltonian operator incorporates quantum mechanical effects such as superposition and tunneling, challenging classical interpretations of spin states. We compute extended Pauli operators and construct the Hamiltonian to include spin-spin interactions and transverse field terms. Our analysis reveals that as the system size increases, fluctuations in energy and entanglement entropy become more evident, indicating lifted sensitivity to external perturbations and suggesting the onset of quantum phase transitions. Spin-spin correlation functions demonstrate that interactions are predominantly local, but larger systems exhibit more complex and fluctuating correlations. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum spin systems and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from a quantum perspective.

Recent work has shown that the contracted Schr\u00f6dinger equation enables the construction of universal, formally exact exponential ans\u00e4tze for quantum many-body physics. However, while the ansatz is capable of resolving arbitrary quantum systems, it still requires a full calculation of its parameters whenever the underlying Hamiltonian changes, even slightly.

Fluid Mech., vol. 825, 2017, pp. 1113-1152). Resonance was suggested by that study to exist between upstream- and downstream-travelling guided waves. Five possible resonance mechanisms were postulated, each involving different families of guided waves that reflect in the nozzle exit plane and at a number of downstream turning points. However, that study did not identify which of the five resonance mechanisms underpin the observed spectral peaks. In this work, the waves underpinning resonance are identified via a biorthogonal projection of Large Eddy Simulation data on eigenbases provided by a locally parallel linear stability analysis. Two of the five scenarios postulated by Towne et al. are thus confirmed to exist in the turbulent jet.

However, most of works focus on RCS reduction of antenna arrays, and there are few studies for a single antenna. Therefore, this letter presents a method to control the null of the in-band RCS by changing the load impedance of the antenna, so as to effectively reduce the RCS at particular directions. First, the relationship between the null position and the load impedance is calculated by analyzing the in-band scattering field of the antenna. Second, the load impedance of the traditional patch antenna is controlled by cascading an open-circuit stub of different lengths on the feeding line. Then, the null tunning of the in-band RCS is realized. Simulated and measured results show that the designed patch antenna can tune the null of in-band RCS from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Thus, the in-band RCS is effectively reduced under the premise that the radiation performance is basically unchanged.         ",

This result is used to derive a set of analytical expressions that characterize the light response curves of photosynthetic parameters, including that of gross photosynthetic rate which saturates in high light and has long been assumed to obey a Michaelis-Menten function.

It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also available.

    "abstract": "           We theoretically and computationally investigate the cooling of antihydrogen, $\\bar{H}$, using optical molasses cooling. This updates the results in Ref. [1] to the current capabilities of the ALPHA experiment. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that $\\bar{H}$s do not give the standard cooling even in an ideal optical molasses because of their small mass and large transition frequency. For optical molasses cooling in the ALPHA trap, the photons are constrained to travel in one direction only. It is only through the phase space mixing in the trap that cooling in all directions can be achieved. We explore the nontrivial role that laser intensity plays in the cooling. We also investigate the possibility for simultaneously cooling atoms in either of the trapped ground states.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report a method for coherent control of $\\gamma$-photons, enabling the shaping of $\\gamma$-ray intensity in nearly arbitrary waveforms. Different intensity waveforms are created by adjusting the motion profile of a resonant absorber (an ensemble of M\u00f6ssbauer nuclei) and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this method is the use of a low fundamental frequency of vibrations, which broadens the possibilities for $\\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are experimentally validated by generating single and double $\\gamma$-pulses and inducing short-term absorption. For this, a resonant absorber containing $^{57}$Fe nuclei was vibrated with different motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with a fundamental frequency of 1\\,MHz. The proposed technique represents an advancement in the manipulation of $\\gamma$-rays and potentially X-rays, paving the way for the performance of new types of $\\gamma$-ray or X-ray quantum experiments and the development of new tools such as adjustable tabletop $\\gamma$-pulse sources or $\\gamma$-ray or X-ray delays and gates. Moreover, inverse application of the method enables the measurement of displacements at the picometer level.         ",

Experiments performed in a waveguide filled with helium gas confirm that energetic (from several keV to several tens of keV) electrons remain in plasma long after the pulse has crossed the experimental volume. These electrons continue the gas ionization over extended times up to tens of nanoseconds.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with >100,000 traps, facilitating tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.

    "abstract": "           We investigate the use of an atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with a pulsed non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) source as a space-based acceleration sensor. We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.

In this work, we revisit the dissipaton equation of motion theory and establish an equivalent dissipatons-embedded quantum master equation (DQME), which gives rise to dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles. As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and thus the physically supporting hybrid bath modes. Numerical demonstrations are carried out on the electron transfer model, exhibiting the transient statistical properties of the solvation coordinate.         ",
