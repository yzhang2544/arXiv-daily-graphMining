    "abstract": "           Rapid progress in precision nanofabrication and atomic design over the past 50 years has ushered in a succession of transformative eras for molding the generation and flow of light. The use of nanoscale and atomic features to design light sources and optical elements-encapsulated by the term nanophotonics-has led to new fundamental science and innovative technologies across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with substantial emphasis on the microwave to visible regimes. In this review, we pay special attention to the impact and potential of nanophotonics in a relatively exotic yet technologically disruptive regime: high-energy particles such as X-ray photons and free electrons-where nanostructures and atomic design open the doors to unprecedented technologies in quantum science and versatile X-ray sources and optics. As the practical generation of X-rays is intrinsically linked to the existence of energetic free or quasi-free-electrons, our review will also capture related phenomena and technologies that combine free electrons with nanophotonics, including free-electron-driven nanophotonics at other photon energies. In particular, we delve into the demonstration and study of quantum recoil in the X-ray regime, the study of nanomaterial design and free-electron wave shaping as means to enhance and control X-ray radiation, examine the free-electron generation enabled by nanophotonics, and analyze the high-harmonic generation by quasi-free electrons. We also discuss applications of quantum nanophotonics for X-rays and free electrons, including nanostructure waveguides for X-rays, photon pair enhanced X-ray imaging, mirrors, and lenses for X-rays, among others.

    "abstract": "           We propose a low-dimensional modeling approach to simulate the dynamics, acoustic emissions and interactions of cavitation bubbles, based on a quasi-acoustic assumption. This quasi-acoustic assumption accounts for the compressibility of the medium surrounding the bubble and its finite speed of sound, whereby the potential of the acoustic wave emitted by the bubble propagates along outgoing characteristics. With these ingredients, a consistent set of equations describing the radial bubble dynamics as well as the resulting acoustic emissions and bubble-bubble interactions is obtained, which is accurate to the first order of the Mach number. This model is tested by considering several representative test cases, including the resonance behavior of multiple interacting bubbles and the response of dense mono- and polydisperse bubble clusters to a change in ambient pressure. The results are shown to be in excellent agreement with results reported in the literature. The differences associated with the finite propagation speed of the acoustic waves are observed to be most pronounced for the pressure-driven bubble dynamics in dense bubble clusters and the onset of cavitation in response to a change in ambient pressure.

    "abstract": "           The mid-wave (MWIR) spectral range can provide a larger bandwidth for optical sensing and communication when the near-infrared band gets congested. As optical sensing becomes a robust technique for digital imaging and object recognition, this range of thermal imaging needs to convey more information, which can be unraveled from polarization-sensitive detection by integrating the metasurface of the subwavelength scale structured interface to control light-matter interaction. To enforce metasurface-enable simultaneous detection and parallel analysis of polarization states in a compact footprint for 4-micron wavelength, we design a high-contrast Germanium metasurface with an axially asymmetric triangular nanoantenna of the thickness of 0.525 times the wavelength. First, we optimized linear polarization separation of a 52-degree angle with 50% transmission efficiency, holding the meta-element aspect ratio from the 3.5-1.67 range. The transmission modulation in terms of periodicity and lattice resonance for the phase gradient high contrast dielectric grating in correlation with scattering cross-section for both 1D and 2D cases has been discussed, which enables the reduction of the aspect ratio to meet the nanofabrication challenge. Further, by employing the geometric phase, we get 40% and 60% transmission contrast for linear and circular polarization states, respectively, and reconstruct the Stokes vectors and output polarization states. Without spatial multiplexing, this single metasurface unit cell can perform well for the division of focal plane Stoke thermal imaging with an almost 5-degree tilted incidence, excellent refractive index, and height tolerance.

We introduce a comprehensive model to analyze the ultrafast dynamics of interband photo-excited carriers in QW p-i-n structures and to calculate their frequency response. This model characterizes the entire photocarrier transport process, including carrier escape from QWs and movement across heterojunction interfaces. Additionally, we outline theoretical methods for calculating carrier escape times from both QWs and heterojunction interfaces.

The improvement ratio ranged from 50% to 280%, while the laser fluency of the infrared laser was as small as about 1.6% of that of the ultraviolet laser. Although, we have not succeed in explaining the reasons why this effect occurs, it will have the potentiality to decrease the photon cost in the wide range of ultraviolet laser machining, because the method and the phenomena are simple and clear.

By addressing these issues, we offer a clearer exposition and a more robust algorithm. Our method assumes a parabolic profile for the E layer and approximates the F layer with a series of concatenated quasi-parabolic segments, ensuring continuity and smoothness by matching derivatives at the junctions.

A joint analysis of complementary and redundant data allows, e.g., to improve the reliability of parameter estimation, to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of profiles, to obtain synergistic effects, to consider diagnostics interdependencies and to find and resolve data inconsistencies. Physics-based modelling and parameter relationships provide additional information improving the treatment of ill-posed inversion problems.

The detection mechanism is evidenced by the shift in the onset of the SET current peaks and by the occurrence of random telegraph signals (RTS) under light irradiation, as compared to the dark condition.

To reveal charge and spin redistribution during these reactions the CAS(4,4) wave functions were analyzed using the OVB method (orthogonal valence bond). The potential energy curves, different internal coordinates, and the results of the OVB analysis show, that frequently the addition and elimination reactions follow differen minimum energy paths, because they are diabatic reactions. In these cases, there are no energy barriers corresponding to saddle points on the potential energy surfaces but there is an energy increase during one diabatic reaction, then the system jumps to the other diabatic state and the energy decreases. This happens for reactions in $C_{2v}$ symmetry, as soon as the system can change to the lower symmetry, the diabatic states combine to an adiabatic and the reaction follow the single minimum energy path.

NGRCs apply a feed-forward architecture to produce a feature vector directly from the input data over a fixed number of time steps. This feature vector, analogous to the reservoir state in a conventional RC, is used to perform inference by applying a decision layer trained by linear regression. Photonic NGRC provides a flexible platform for real-time inference by forgoing the need for explicit feedback loops inherent to a physical reservoir. The FM-NGRC introduced here defines the memory structure using an optical frequency comb and dispersive fiber while the sinusoidal response of electro-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometers controls the nonlinear transform applied to elements of the feature vector. A programmable waveshaper modulates each comb tooth independently to apply the trained decision layer weights in the analog domain. We apply the FM-NGRC to solve the benchmark nonlinear channel equalization task; after theoretically determining feature vectors that enable high-accuracy distortion compensation, we construct an FM-NGRC that generates these vectors to experimentally demonstrate real-time channel equalization at 5 GS/s with a symbol error rate of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{-3}$.

In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise.

The narrow bandgap width of single-layer resonator has prompted the exploration of multi-layer metamaterials as an effective alternative, which consist of alternating nests of high-contrast materials, called ``resonators'', and a background media. In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for studying acoustics within multi-layer high-contrast structures. Firstly, by using layer potential techniques, we establish the representation formula in terms of a matrix type operator with a block tridiagonal form for multi-layer structures within general geometry. Then we prove the existence of subwavelength resonances via Gohberg-Sigal theory, which generalizes the celebrated Minnaert resonances in single-layer structures. Intriguingly, we find that the primary contribution to mode splitting lies in the fact that as the number of nested resonators increases, the degree of the corresponding characteristic polynomial also increases, while the type of resonance (consists solely of monopolar resonances) remains unchanged. Furthermore, we derive original formulas for the subwavelength resonance frequencies of concentric dual-resonator. Numerical results associated with different nested resonators are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.         ",

This contrasts with superfluorescence (Dicke superradiance), where the cooperative photon emission occurs via a spontaneous buildup of coherence in an ensemble of incoherently excited QDs via their coupling to a common radiation mode. While superfluorescence has been observed in perovskite QD systems, reports of superradiance from the electronically coupled ensemble of perovskite QDs are rare. Here, we demonstrate the generation of polarized superradiance with a very narrow linewidth (<5 meV) and a large redshift (~200 meV) from the electronically coupled CsPbBr3 QD superlattice achieved through a combination of strong quantum confinement and ligand engineering. In addition to photon bunching at low excitation densities, the superradiance is polarized in contrast to the uncoupled exciton emission from the same superlattice. This finding suggests the potential for obtaining polarized cooperative photon emission via anisotropic electronic coupling in QD superlattices even when the intrinsic anisotropy of exciton transition in individual QDs is weak.

Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.         ",

    "abstract": "           Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.         ",

    "abstract": "           Exfoliation and stacking of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals have created unprecedented opportunities in the discovery of quantum phases. A major obstacle to the advancement of this field is the limited spectroscopic access due to a mismatch in sample sizes (1 - 10 micrometer) and wavelengths (0.1 - 1 millimeter) of electromagnetic radiation relevant to their low-energy excitations. Here, we introduce a new member of the 2D vdW material family: a terahertz (THz) emitter. We show intense and broadband THz generation from the vdW ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2 with optical rectification efficiency over one-order-of-magnitude higher than that of the current standard THz emitter, ZnTe. The NbOI2 THz emitter can be easily integrated into vdW heterostructures for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy of a target vdW material/device. Our approach provides a general spectroscopic tool for the rapidly expanding field of 2D vdW materials and quantum matter.         ",

    "abstract": "           Electron beam accelerators are essential in many scientific and technological fields. Their operation relies heavily on the stability and precision of the electron beam. Traditional diagnostic techniques encounter difficulties in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of electron beams. Particularly in the context of free-electron lasers (FELs), it is fundamentally impossible to measure the lasing-on and lasingoff electron power profiles for a single electron bunch. This is a crucial hurdle in the exact reconstruction of the photon pulse profile. To overcome this hurdle, we developed a machine learning model that predicts the temporal power profile of the electron bunch in the lasing-off regime using machine parameters that can be obtained when lasing is on. The model was statistically validated and showed superior predictions compared to the state-of-the-art batch calibrations. The work we present here is a critical element for a virtual pulse reconstruction diagnostic (VPRD) tool designed to reconstruct the power profile of individual photon pulses without requiring repeated measurements in the lasing-off regime. This promises to significantly enhance the diagnostic capabilities in FELs at large.         ",

    "title": "An Improved Bound on Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics using a Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment",
    "abstract": "           There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter $|\\epsilon| \\lessapprox 1.15 \\times 10^{-12}$, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.         ",

The technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be directly applied to applications for ultra-low threshold particle detectors, e.g. low-mass dark matter and far-IR photon sensing. We propose a novel sensor based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as SQUATs: Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmons. We detail the operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that with minimal R&D effort, solid-state based detectors patterned with these sensors can achieve sensitivity to single THz photons, and sensitivity to $1\\,\\mathrm{meV}$ phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ timescale.

    "abstract": "           Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as $-$54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.

We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.

We formally define and address whether this uncertainty is unavoidable or whether post-quantum theories can offer a predictive advantage while conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining three aspects: predictive advantage, no-signalling, and reliable intersubjectivity between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive advantage. However, we uncover a fascinating possibility: When the assumption of reliable intersubjectivity between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can, in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.         ",
