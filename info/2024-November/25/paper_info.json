    "abstract": "           The possibility of generating an narrow spectral hole in a rare-earth doped crystal opens the gateway to a variety of applications, one of which is the realization of an ultrastable laser. As this is achieved by locking in a pre-stabilized laser to the narrow hole, a prerequisite is the elimination of frequency fluctuations of the spectral hole. One potential source of such fluctuations can arise from temperature instabilities. However, when the crystal is surrounded by a buffer gas subject to the same temperature as the crystal, the effect of temperature-induced pressure changes may be used to counterbalance the direct effect of temperature fluctuations. For a particular pressure, it is indeed possible to identify a temperature for which the spectral hole resonant frequency is independent of the first-order thermal fluctuations. Here, we measure frequency shifts as a function of temperature for different values of the pressure of the surrounding buffer gas, and identify the ``magic'' environment within which the spectral hole is largely insensitive to temperature.

In this work, we perform a comparative study between several atomic and molecular gases as media for spectral broadening in a hollow-core fiber geometry. Exploiting nonlinearities such as self-phase modulation, self-steepening, and stimulated Raman scattering, we explore the extent of spectral broadening and its dependence on gas pressure, the critical power for self-focusing, and the optimal regime for few-cycle pulse compression. Using a 3-mJ, 200-fs input laser pulses, we achieve ~ 15 fs, few-cycle pulses with >70% overall energy transmission efficiency. The optimal parameters can be scaled for higher or lower input pulse energies with appropriate gas parameters and fiber geometry.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and the optical cavity field can modify vibrational energy transfer (VET) processes in molecular systems. However, the underlying mechanisms and the behavior of individual molecules under collective VSC remain largely incomplete. In this work, we combine state-of-the-art quantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamics simulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how the vibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the (H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSC breaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches, and opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving both neighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET process relies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of the corresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathways is found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OH stretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in mode coupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirm and extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes but also provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.

Complementary to $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this letter, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we demonstrate that by precisely manipulating the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues(or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices.

A tailored gain-loss variation, while encircling higher-order EPs dynamically, can significantly enhance the control of the topological flow of light in multi-level photonic systems. In particular, the integration of dynamically encircled higher-order EPs within fiber geometries holds remarkable promise for advancing specialty optical fiber applications, though a research gap remains in exploring and realizing such configurations. Here, we report a triple-core specialty optical fiber engineered with customized loss and gain to explore the topological characteristics of a third-order exceptional point (EP3), formed by two interconnected second-order exceptional points (EP2s). We elucidate chiral and nonchiral light transmission through the fiber, grounded in second- and third-order branch point behaviors and associated adiabatic and nonadiabatic modal characteristics, while considering various dynamical parametric loops to encircle the embedded EPs. We investigate the persistence of EP-induced light dynamics specifically in the parametric regions immediately adjacent to, though not encircling, the embedded EPs, potentially leading to improved device performance.

Here a third-order polynomial interconnected circular (TOPIC) bend is proposed to revolutionize the ring designs fundamentally. The TOPIC bend has a unique feature of continuous curvature and curvature derivative, which is theoretically derived to be essential for waveguide loss optimization. With the TOPIC bend, the silicon ring resonators demonstrated here have achieved three records to the best of our knowledge: the smallest radius (0.7 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) for silicon rings resonating with single guided mode, the lowest thermal tuning power (5.85 mW/$\\pi$) for silicon rings with FSR $\\geq$3.2 THz, and the first silicon ring-based WDM 32$\\times$100 GHz filter. The filter has doubled the channel amount compared to the state of the art, and meanwhile achieved low insertion loss (1.91 $\\pm$ 0.28 dB) and low tuning power (283 GHz/mW). Moreover, the TOPIC bend is not limited to ring applications, it can also be used to create bends with an arbitrary angle, with the advantages of ultra-compact radius and heater integration, which are expected to replace all circular bends in integrated photonics, greatly reducing system size and power consumption.

    "abstract": "           High-performance electro-optic modulators play a critical role in modern telecommunication networks and intra-datacenter interconnects. Low driving voltage, large electro-optic bandwidth, compact device size, and multi-band operation ability are essential for various application scenarios, especially energy-efficient high-speed data transmission. However, it is challenging to meet all these requirements simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance dual-band thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic modulator with low-k underfill to achieve overall performance improvement. The low-k material helps reduce the RF loss of the modulator and achieve perfect velocity matching with narrow electrode gap to overcome the voltage-bandwidth limitation, extending electro-optic bandwidth and enhancing modulation efficiency simultaneously. The fabricated 7-mm-long modulator exhibits a low half-wave voltage of 1.9 V at C-band and 1.54 V at O-band, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 1.33 V*cm and 1.08 V*cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the novel design yields an ultra-wide extrapolated 3 dB bandwidth of 220 GHz (218 GHz) in the C-band (O-band). High-speed data transmission in both C- and O-bands using the same device has been demonstrated for the first time by PAM8 with data rates up to 390 Gbit/s, corresponding to a record-low energy consumption of 0.69 fJ/bit for next-generation cost-effective ultra-high-speed optical communications.

In this comment, we highlight fundamental flaws in the mathematical model used to describe photon loss. We argue that the treatment of photon loss and its effects on quantum entanglement is incorrect. We demonstrate that the conclusions of Sengupta et al., particularly the detection of low-reflectivity objects using quantum correlations, are unsubstantiated, as the assumed resilience of polarization entanglement to photon loss contradicts established principles of quantum information theory. We present a more rigorous framework for describing the effects of photon loss on both polarization-encoded and photon-number quantum states. Additionally, we critique the approach used in the OE article to model photon loss in free-space optical (FSO) transmission, noting that it is based on a fiber-optic model that was adopted with insufficient attribution from an earlier publication. We propose several improvements to enhance the modeling of FSO photon loss.         ",

Multilayer VO$_2$-based active metasurfaces are urgently needed however several important issues related to VO$_2$ properties in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$/Al$_2$O$_3$ films should be thoroughly examined first. We study electrical, optical and structural properties of VO$_2$ films as well as their composition and switching characteristics as function of the VO$_2$ layer thickness in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$ composites. XRD analysis revealed an epitaxial growth of films with deformation of the monoclinic VO$_2$ lattice to hexagonal symmetry. Reduced VO$_2$ layer thickness from 170 nm to 20 nm results in increased phase transition temperature while the width of the resistance versus temperature hysteresis loop R(T) remains constant at ~6C for all VO$_2$ thicknesses in the range of 20-170 nm. The resistance alteration ratio is reduced from 4.2e3 to 2.7e2 in thinner films. Raman spectra reveal a significant shift of VO$_2$ lattice vibration modes for films thinner than 30 nm claiming a great structural strain whereas modes position for thicker VO$_2$ layers are similar to those in bulk structure. Composition of VO$_2$ films has revealed only a minor alteration of VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ phases ratio from 1.6 to 1.8 when the film thickness has been increased from 20 nm to 50 nm. Investigation of surface elemental composition and valence states of VO$_2$ films revealed that VO$_2$/V$_2$O$_5$ ratio remains practically unchanged with thickness reduction. The study of electrical MIT dynamics revealed the switching time of a 50 nm VO$_2$ film to be as low as 800 ns.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optically bistable materials respond to a single input with two possible optical outputs, contingent upon excitation history. Such materials would be ideal for optical switching and memory, yet limited understanding of intrinsic optical bistability (IOB) prevents development of nanoscale IOB materials suitable for devices. Here, we demonstrate IOB in Nd3+-doped KPb2Cl5 avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs), which switch with high contrast between luminescent and non-luminescent states, with hysteresis characteristic of bistability. We elucidate a nonthermal mechanism in which IOB originates from suppressed nonradiative relaxation in Nd3+ ions and from the positive feedback of photon avalanching, resulting in extreme, >200th-order optical nonlinearities. Modulation of laser pulsing tunes hysteresis widths, and dual-laser excitation enables transistor-like optical switching. This control over nanoscale IOB establishes ANPs for photonic devices in which light is used to manipulate light.         ",

    "abstract": "           The nonlinear response of materials, an increasingly important aspect of light-matter interaction, can be challenging to measure in highly absorbing materials. Here, we introduce an interferometric technique that enables a direct measurement of the nonlinear complex permittivity in a bulk medium from reflectivity alone. We demonstrate the utility of pump-probe supercontinuum (SC) spectral interferometry in reflection by measuring time-dependent variations in the complex dielectric function ($n$, $k$) over the visible wavelength range in bulk silicon. Transient phase shifts in the reflected SC due to a near infrared pump pulse allow us to track modifications to $k$; whereas changes in $n$ are derived from transient fluctuations in the reflected SC probe amplitude. The ultrafast response is attributed to effective two-photon absorption ($\\beta$) and Kerr ($n_2$) coefficients. We observe the onset of strong two-photon absorption as the two-photon energy is tuned through the direct band edge of silicon ($E_1$ = 3.4 eV) for the first time to our knowledge. This technique allows straightforward spectroscopic measurements of the $\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear response at the surface of absorbing materials.         ",

In this work, we propose a new approach for the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work with automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable Connected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating its application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic optimization task. Since these geometries are built upon the principles of automatic differentiation, they are compatible with existing deep learning frameworks, a feature we demonstrate via the application examples. This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.

    "abstract": "           In a companion paper, we have developed a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields, whereby the electronic energy levels arise from diagonalizing a phase-space Hamiltonian $\\hat H_{PS}(\\bf{X},\\bf{\\Pi})$ that depends parametrically on nuclear position and momentum. The resulting eigenvalues are translationally invariant; moreover, if the magnetic field is in the $z-$direction, then the eigenvalues are also invariant to rotations around the $z-$direction. However, like all Hamiltonians in a magnetic field, the theory has a gauge degree of freedom (corresponding to the position of the magnetic origin in the vector potential), and requires either $(i)$ formally, a complete set of electronic states or $(ii)$ in practice, gauge invariant atomic orbitals (GIAOs) in order to realize such translational and rotational invariance. Here we describe how to implement a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian using GIAOs within a practical electronic structure package (in our case, Q-Chem). We further show that novel phenomena can be observed with finite $\\bf{B}-$fields, including minimum energy structures with $\\bf{\\Pi}_{min} \\ne 0$, indicating non-zero electronic motion in the ground-state.

However, the challenge of establishing room-temperature entangled registers on these integrated photonics platforms remains unresolved. Herein, we demonstrate the first entangled processor on the SiCOI platform. We show that both deterministic generation of single divacancy electron spins and near-unity spin initialization of a single $^{13}$C nuclear spin can be achieved on SiCOI at room temperature. Besides coherently manipulating the single nuclear spin, a maximally entangled state with a fidelity of 0.89 has been prepared on this CMOS-compatible semiconductor-integrated photonics system. This work establishes the foundation for compact and on-chip solutions within existing defect-based computing and sensing protocols, positioning the SiCOI platform as the most promising candidate for integrated monolithic quantum photonic networks.

    "abstract": "           Partially synchronized solitary states occur frequently when a synchronized system of networked oscillators is perturbed locally. Several asymptotic states of different frequencies can coexist at the same node. Here, we reveal the mechanism behind this multistability: additional solitary frequencies arise from the coupling between network modes and the solitary oscillator's frequency, leading to significant energy transfer. This can cause the solitary node's frequency to resonate with a Laplacian eigenvalue. We analyze which network structures enable this resonance and explain longstanding numerical observations. Another solitary state is characterized by the effective decoupling of the synchronized network and the solitary node at the natural frequency. Our framework unifies the description of solitary states near and far from resonance, allowing to predict the behavior of complex networks.         ",
