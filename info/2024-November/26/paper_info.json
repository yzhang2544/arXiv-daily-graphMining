    "abstract": "           We analyze essential properties about gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) grounded on spin gauge symmetry by taking the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as example. A constraint equation for the field strength of gravigaiuge field is obtained to be as gravitization equation in spin-related gravigauge spacetime, which indicates how the gravitational effect emerges from non-commutative relation of gravigauge derivative operator. By representing the action in Minkowski spacetime, we show that translational invariance leads to zero energy momentum tensor in GQFT when applying for equations of motion for all basic fields including gravigauge field, which extends conservation law of energy momentum tensor in quantum field theory to cancellation law of energy momentum tensor in GQFT. An equivalence between general gravitational equation and zero energy momentum tensor is naturally resulted in GQFT.         ",

    "abstract": "           High-speed signal processing is essential for maximizing data throughput in emerging communication applications, like multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and radio-frequency (RF) interference cancellation. However, as these technologies scale, they increase hardware complexity, computing power demands, and create significant digital signal processing (DSP) challenges. While transistor miniaturization has improved digital electronic processors, they still face physical bottlenecks, limiting computational throughput and increasing DSP latency. Photonic processors present a promising alternative, offering large bandwidth, low loss, parallel processing, and low latency. Yet, scalability in photonic processors remains limited by system integration, device size, and on-chip multiplexing challenges. Here, we introduce a scalable on-chip hybrid multiplexed photonic processor, combining mode-division multiplexing (MDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). This marks the first implementation of a monolithically integrated MDM-WDM-compatible processor, featuring mode multiplexers, multimode microring resonators, and multimode balanced photodetectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time unscrambling of 5 Gb/s non-return-to-zero optical MIMO signals and RF phase-shift keying signal unjamming. Our system's 30 ps processing latency makes it ideal for real-time MIMO and RF applications. Our analysis reveals that hybrid MDM-WDM multiplexing improves the number of operations per second by 4.1 times over spatially multiplexed WDM configurations, positioning it as a strong candidate for next-generation large-scale photonic processors.

The method involves breaking the in-plane symmetry along the diagonal of the metasurface unit cell by introducing air holes in the tetramers. Through our simulations, we show that this flexible approach enables the support of dual-band BICs in the telecom-band range, with these modes evolving into quasi-BICs with remarkably high quality factors by breaking the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, the ultracompact device exhibits the unique characteristic of being polarization-independent across all viewing angles. Finally, the optically pumped gain medium provides sufficient optical gain to compensate the quasi-BIC mode losses, enabling two mode lasing with ultra-low pump threshold and very narrow optical linewidth in the telecom-band range. Our adaptable device paves the way for polarization-insensitive metasurfaces with multiple lasing resonances. This innovation holds the potential to transform areas like low-threshold lasing and biosensing by delivering improved performance and broader capabilities.         ",

Nonreciprocal metasurfaces can enable one-way light transmission and reflection with essential applications in optical communication. Conventional nonreciprocal metasurfaces rely on using magneto-optic or nonlinear materials to induce nonreciprocal optical properties. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal metasurfaces based on the relativistic effect of a moving medium. The metasurface is composed of periodic spinning dielectric cylinders located above a dielectric substrate. The spinning motion breaks the time-reversal symmetry and induces bi-anisotropic Tellegen-type response of the meta-atoms. We show that the metasurface can realize both asymmetric and nonreciprocal manipulations of the incident plane wave. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the Sagnac effect associated with the chiral multipole modes of the coupled spinning cylinders. By introducing dielectric pillars to modulate the phase profile, the metasurface can enable nonreciprocal wavefront manipulations. Our work offers a new mechanism for realizing nonreciprocal light manipulation in free space. The proposed metasurface can serve as a platform to explore the interesting physics of nonreciprocal optics, non-Hermitian optics, and topological photonics.         ",

In these systems $\\unicode{x2014}$ referred to as coherent Ising machines $\\unicode{x2014}$ the spins are encoded in the phases of the oscillators, and spin states are measured at the system output using phase-sensitive techniques. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a conceptually new optical Ising machine based upon spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking within a coherently-driven optical fibre Kerr nonlinear resonator. In our scheme, the spin states are encoded using polarization, which allows the state of the network to be robustly read out using straightforward intensity measurements. Furthermore, by operating within a recently-discovered regime where the interplay between nonlinearity and topology fundamentally safeguards the system's symmetry, we ensure that our spins evolve without unwanted biases. This enables continuous Ising machine trials at optical data rates for up to an hour without resetting or manual adjustments. With an all-fibre implementation that relies solely on standard telecommunications components, we believe our work paves the way for substantial advances in the performance and stability of coherent optical Ising machines for applications ranging from financial modeling to drug discovery and machine learning.

Among the ONNs, optical recurrent neural network (RNN) enables low-power and high-speed time-series data processing using a compact loop structure. The loop losses need to be efficiently compensated so that the time-series information is maintained in the RNN operation. For this purpose, we focus on the optoelectronic RNN (OE-RNN) with optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters to compensate for the loop losses. However, the effect of resistive-capacitive (RC) delay of OEO converters on the RNN performance is unclear. Here, we study in simulation an OE-RNN equipped with OEO converters with RC delay. We confirm that our modeled OE-RNN achieves the high training accuracy of time-series data classification even when RC delay is comparably large to the time interval of time-series data. Our analyses reveal that the accumulation of time-series data by RC delay does not degrade the RNN performance but rather can compensate for the degraded RNN performance due to loop losses. From the theoretical analysis referring to the gradient explosion and vanishing problems, we find the region related to loss and RC delay where the high training accuracy can be achieved. In simulation, we confirm this compensation effect in the large OE-RNN circuit up to 32$\\times$32 scale. Our proposed scheme opens a new way of time-series data processing by utilizing RC delay for the optical computing and optical communication.         ",

As a result, it has found wide applications ranging from material science to biology. Dual-trap optical tweezers (DTOT) are of particular importance as they allow for two point correlation measurements as in molecular force spectroscopy, two-point active micro-rheology, etc. Here we report a novel design for a steerable DTOT setup which uses back-scattered light from the two traps for position detection. This is performed using a confocal scheme where the two detectors are placed at the conjugate points to the respective traps. This offers several significant advantages over current designs, such as, zero cross-talk between signals, single module assembly and robustness to thermal drift. Moreover, our design can be very easily integrated with standard microscopy techniques like Phase contrast and Differential Interference Contrast, without modifying the microscope illumination unit.

    "abstract": "           Manipulating intensity, phase and polarization of the electromagnetic fields on ultrafast timescales is essential for all-optical switching, optical information processing and development of novel time-variant media. Noble metal based plasmonics has provided numerous platforms for optical switching and control, enabled by strong local field enhancement, artificially engineered dispersion and strong Kerr-type free-electron nonlinearities. However, precise control over switching times and spectrum remains challenging, commonly limited by the relaxation of hot-electron gas on picosecond time scales and the band structure of materials. Here we experimentally demonstrate the strong and tuneable nonlinearity in a metamaterial on a mirror geometry, controlled by the wavelength of excitation, which imprints a specific non-uniform hot-electron population distribution and drives targeted electron and lattice dynamics. The interplay of electromagnetic, electronic and mechanical energy exchange allows us to achieve sub-300~fs timescales in the recovery of optical constants in the selected spectral domains, where the modulation surpasses the limitations imposed by the inherent material response of metamaterial components, owing to emergence of a Fano-type destructive interference with acoustic vibrations of the metamaterial, featured in reflection but not in transmission. The observed effects are highly spectrally selective and sensitive to the polarisation properties of light and the Fabry-Perot modes of the metamaterial, opening a pathway for controlling the switching rates by spectral selection and nanostructure design. The capability to manipulate temporal, spectral and mechanical aspects of light-matter interactions underscores new potential nonlinear applications where polarisation diversity, spectral selectivity and fast modulation are important.

We propose two machine-learning-based signal processing methods: one supervised learning method and one unsupervised clustering method. By benchmarking against data obtained using coherent states and squeezed states, we show that the methods extend the TES operation rate to 800 kHz, achieving at least a four-fold improvement, whilst maintaining accurate photon-number assignment up to at least five photons.

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.         ",

Yet direct experimental detection of water wires has been elusive so far. Based on advanced $ab$ $initio$ many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge transfer exciton. In water, the charge transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.         ",

While short-time evolution converges quickly, long-time evolution requires a much larger number of stochastic trajectories, leading to high computational costs. To this end,we propose a scheme that combines neural network techniques with simulations of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equation. By integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs),along with the iterative attentional feature fusion (iAFF) technique, this approach significantly reduces the number of trajectories required for long-time simulations, particularly at low temperatures, thereby substantially lowering computational costs and improving convergence.

    "abstract": "           Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes and long timescales involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on near-term quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spetroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.

This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.

    "abstract": "           The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose and study a method for measuring the chromatic dispersion parameter (D) of optical fibers and bulk optical elements through the use of a single-arm three-wave interferometer and a fiber femtosecond frequency comb (FFFC). The FFFC is frequency locked to a single-ytterbium-ion optical standard and employed as a source of highly stable and broadband laser radiation. The FFFC spectrum ranges from 1 to 2 microns, which is the most demanded range in fiber optics. The theoretical model presented in the work is used to derive analytical expressions for the parameter D, taking into account the second-order group velocity dispersion. To validate the methodology, the parameter D is measured for a standard single-mode SMF-28 fiber. The proposed method enables the precise measurement of the parameter D with high accuracy across a broad spectral range in a relatively short time.         ",

The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.

    "abstract": "           We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.

We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.         ",

Here, we examine quantum photonic gates that utilize continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. In addition, we provide studying the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error-correction.
