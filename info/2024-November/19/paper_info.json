    "title": "Towards 250-m gigabits-per-second underwater wireless optical communication using a low-complexity ANN equalizer",
    "abstract": "           The breakthroughs of communication distance and data rate have been eagerly anticipated by scientists in the area of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC), which is seriously limited by the obvious aquatic attenuation in underwater channel. High-power laser source and ultra-sensitive photodetector are straightforward to extend the UWOC distance. However, nonlinear impairments caused by bandwidth-limited high-power transmitter and sensitive receiver severely degrade the data rate of long-distance UWOC. In this paper, we develop a UWOC system using a high-power transmitter by beam combining of 8-channel cascaded laser diodes (LD) and a sensitive receiver by a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). The combined linear equalizer and low-complexity Artificial Neural Network (ANN) equalizer are used to achieve 1-Gbps data transmission over a 250-m UWOC system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Gbps-level UWOC experimental demonstration in >250-meter underwater transmission that has ever been reported. To lower the complexity of the ANN equalizer, a linear equalizer is applied first in order to prune the input size of the ANN equalizer. The optimal input size of the ANN equalizer is identified as 9. And the ANN architecture consists of two hidden layers, with 10 neurons in the first layer and a single neuron in the second layer. The performance of the proposed ANN-based system is compared with that of systems employing Volterra and linear equalizers. The bit error rate (BER) at data rate of 1 Gbps over a 250-m UWOC is reduced to with the combined linear and ANN equalizer, which is below the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit. In contrast, the linear and Volterra equalizer-based systems achieve data rates of 500 Mbps and 750 Mbps, respectively.         ",

    "abstract": "           A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) was conducted to investigate its photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer for singlet oxygen generation. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods were used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) in a model monoiodinated BODIPY molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference ADC(2) method. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) was tested against ADC(2) using different exchange-correlation functionals, employing a two-component pseudopotential basis set for iodine. SOC magnitudes between excited states were discussed using the Slater-Condon rules. The geometry dependence of SOCs for the lowest states was also examined. TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP were selected for subsequent absorption spectra and trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two bright states were identified in I-BODIPY's visible spectrum, showing a red shift due to iodine substitution. Excited-state MD simulations, including nonadiabatic effects and SOCs, were performed to investigate relaxation after photoexcitation to the S1 state. TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a similar timescale to internal conversions. After triplet population growth, a \"saturation\" phase was reached with a triplet-to-singlet ratio of about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 agrees qualitatively with the experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99.         ",

    "abstract": "           Density-integrated, multi-wavelength nanoscale lasers with ultra-low power consumption and ultra-compact footprints are essential for energy-efficient, fast and high-throughput data processing. Currently, on-chip multi-wavelength lasers predominantly rely on arrays of discrete large-scale conventional semiconductor lasers that are susceptible to the fabrication imperfections. Topological rainbow nanolasers, which spatially confine and emit specific topologically protected light frequencies, offer a prospective approach for achieving ultra-compact integrated multi-wavelength light sources with enhanced robustness against perturbations and defects. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve highly localized topological rainbow trapping in nanocavities for laser emission with both high quality factors and ultra-small mode volumes. Here, we experimentally report ultra-compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers operating in the 1550 nm telecom band. Specifically, we present rainbow-like emission with uniform wavelength spacing and wavelength-scale mode volume $\\sim 0.7 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^3$ in a one-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust lasing operation across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate an ultra-compact two-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser in an exceptionally compact footprint of nearly 0.002 $\\text{mm}^2$, featuring a broad rainbow spectra with 64 continuously tuned lasing peaks. Our work provides a promising method for realizing robust and nanoscale multi-wavelength tunable laser sources, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra-compact photonic chips.

    "abstract": "           Optical tweezers, with their high precision, dynamic control, and non-invasiveness, are increasingly important in scientific research and applications at the micro and nano scales. However, manipulation by optical tweezers is challenged by adsorption forces, including van der Waals forces, capillary forces, and electrostatic forces, which are present between micro- and nano-objects. Due to the inherent limitations of optical forces imposed by laser power, these adsorption forces are difficult to overcome. Inspired by maglev trains, we propose a multiphysics coupling method that combines dielectrophoretic and optical gradient forces to achieve broad applicability and low-damage micro-nanoscale particle manipulation. We developed a device that introduces electric fields to detach objects from hard substrates using alternating current (AC) dielectric levitation before manipulation with optical tweezers. We utilized micron-sized polystyrene (PS) microspheres as objects and elucidated the levitation mechanism through finite element simulation. For larger particles, such as a 100 {\\mu}m PS microparticle and a 200 {\\mu}m micro-gear, AC dielectric levitation enabled manipulation by optical tweezers. Also, the better viability of three kinds of cells displayed the low bio-damage of the proposed method. Given its broad applicability and biocompatibility, AC dielectric levitation technology significantly expands the capabilities of optical tweezers, allowing for the manipulation of larger particles and cells. This advancement addresses the limitations of optical tweezers in handling large-scale particles and enhances their versatility in various applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper extends a previous model for p-i-n GaAs quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) by revising the equation of photocarrier generation rate in quantum dots (QDs) inside the intrinsic region. In our model, we address a notable discrepancy that arose from the previous model where they did not consider the volume of QDs within the intrinsic region, leading to an overestimation of the photocarrier generation rate. Our present model rectifies this by incorporating the volume of quantum dots, resulting in adjustments to the photocarrier generation rate. Additionally, we determine the absorption coefficient of the QDs based on Mie theory for different diameter sizes considering the constant volume fraction of the total number of QDs in the intrinsic region. We observe in our analysis that the absorption spectra of the QDs and host material may overlap in certain cases, although the previous model assumed no overlap. This finding suggests the need for caution when evaluating spectral overlap: if the spectra do not overlap, both the previous and current modified models can be reliably applied. However, in cases of overlap, careful consideration is required to ensure accurate predictions of photocarrier generation. Furthermore, investigating the effect of QD diameter size on the photocarrier generation rate in the intrinsic region, we find that smaller QD sizes result in a higher absorption coefficient as well as a higher generation rate for a constant volume of QDs in the region. Moreover, we establish the optimization of the QDs array size by varying the size and the total volume of QDs to improve the generation rate. Our analysis reveals that a higher volume of QDs and a smaller size of QDs result in the maximum generation rate. From an experimental perspective, we propose that the optimal arrangement of QDs in such solar cells is a 0.5 volume fraction with a QD diameter of 2 nm.         ",

The squeezing level is robust across multiple devices and pump detunings, and is consistent with the overcoupling degree without noticeable degradation from excess classical noise. We also offer insights to mitigate thermally-induced excess noise, that typically degrades squeezing, by using small-radius rings with a larger free spectral range (450 GHz) and consequently lower parametric oscillation thresholds. Our results demonstrate that Si$_3$N$_4$ is a viable platform for strong quantum noise reduction in a CMOS-compatible, scalable architecture.         ",

    "abstract": "           Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it has been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation spots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be produced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that polarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.         ",

We introduce an integrated Ising-type model, that includes global inhibition, and use it to explore its role in decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain's decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered. Within the model, the critical region near the transition line has the advantageous property of enabling a significant decrease in error with a small increase in inhibition and also exhibits unique properties with respect to learning and memory decay.

    "abstract": "           A new caesium (Cs) fountain clock NIM6 has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) in China, for which a comprehensive uncertainty evaluation is presented. A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) loading optical molasses is employed to obtain more cold atoms rapidly and efficiently with a tunable, uniform density distribution. A heat pipe surrounding the flight tube maintains a consistent and stable temperature within the interrogation region. Additionally, a Ramsey cavity with four azimuthally distribution feeds is utilized to mitigate distributed cavity phase shifts. The Cs fountain clock NIM6 achieves a short-term stability of 1.0x10-13 {\\tau}-1/2 at high atomic density, and a typical overall fractional type-B uncertainty is estimated to be 2.3x10-16. Comparisons of frequency between the Cs fountain NIM6 and other Cs fountain Primary Frequency Standards (PFSs) through Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) have demonstrated an agreement within the stated uncertainties.

    "abstract": "           Valleytronics is an emerging technology exploiting the anisotropy of electron populations in multiple energy degenerate conduction band minima (valleys) in semiconductors for information storage and processing. To compete with conventional electronics, universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of electrons have to be developed. Addressing the inequivalent conduction band valleys based on optical selection rules has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry. However, selective optical manipulation with electron populations in inequivalent valleys has not been possible in many technologically important semiconductor materials that possess multiple conduction band minima, including silicon and diamond. Here we demonstrate an ultrafast technique allowing to generate and read valley polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on sub-picosecond time scales. The principle is based on unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. The degree of valley polarization is measured via polarization anisotropy of Drude absorption of a delayed infrared probe pulse allowing us to directly characterize intervalley scattering times in silicon and diamond at different temperatures. Our results pave the way towards room temperature valleytronic devices working at terahertz frequencies that will be compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.         ",

We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay.

This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. We have used density functional theory ($\\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize the geometries of 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers consistent with 5,599 unique stoichiometries. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of all the energetically lowest conformers (10,793 molecules) with up to 4 heavy atoms. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange-correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV and molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (aka \"alchemical potential\"), Mulliken charges, and Kohn-Sham orbitals. Supervised machine learning (ML) models of atomization energies on the energetically lowest conformers for the 258k constitutional isomers indicate a significantly more challenging benchmark than the previously introduced QM9 dataset with none of our models reaching chemical accuracy. VQM24 represents an accurate and unbiased benchmark dataset ideal for assessing the efficiency, accuracy and transferability of quantum ML models of real systems.         ",

By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.

However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.

    "abstract": "           Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are fast in-propagation and high bandwidth paradigms that aim to popularize reproducible NN acceleration with higher efficiency and lower cost. However, the training of PNN is known to be a challenge, where the device-to-device and system-to-system variations create imperfect knowledge of the PNN. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training algorithms often being the industry standard for their robustness, generality, and fast gradient convergence for digital training, existing PNN-BP methods rely heavily on the accurate intermediate state extraction for a deep PNN (DPNN). These information accesses truncate the photonic signal propagation, bottlenecking DPNN's operation speed and increasing the system construction cost. Here, we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, tailored for encapsulated DPNNs, where the signal is preserved in the analogue photonic domain for the entire structure. AT's minimum information readout for training bypasses analogue-digital interfaces wherever possible for fast operation and minimum system footprint. AT's error tolerance and generality aim to promote PNN acceleration in a widened operational scenario despite the fabrication variations and imperfect controls. We demonstrated AT for encapsulated DPNN with integrated photonic chips, repeatably enhancing the performance from in-silico BP for different network structures and datasets.         ",

    "title": "Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra",
    "abstract": "           Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.
