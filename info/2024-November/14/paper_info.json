    "abstract": "           The purpose of this study is to explore whether the relationship between bias and nudges can be mathematically expressed in terms of quantum information theory, particularly by means of individually customized nudges. Based on the value function of customer satisfaction, which is subject to uncertainty due to the subjectivity of customer evaluations, a model of bias and nudges is proposed that takes into account the environment for intangible goods. Then, by defining an index of nudges from the mathematical properties of the value function obtained from this economic model, a model could be expressed in this study that has a mathematical structure of the same nature as nudges expressed in standard economics, where welfare is impaired by bias from the mathematical structure of the gross social surplus derived as a social welfare function. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the gross social surplus can be made larger than that in standard economics, adding knowledge about the mathematical design of nudges as individually customized customer experiences. This increases the feasibility of the economic model based on quantum information theory and the mathematical design of customized nudges.         ",

    "abstract": "           Superconducting sensors doped with rare isotopes have recently demonstrated powerful sensing performance for sub-keV radiation from nuclear decay. Here, we report the first high-resolution recoil spectroscopy of a single, selected nuclear state using superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The STJ sensors were used to measure the eV-scale nuclear recoils produced in $^7$Be electron capture decay in coincidence with the 478 keV $\\gamma$-ray emitted in decays to the excited nuclear state in $^7$Li. Details of the Doppler broadened recoil spectrum depend on the slow-down dynamics of the recoil ion and can constrain the interaction potential between the recoiling Li and the Ta matrix of the STJ sensor. The results have implications in several areas from nuclear structure and stopping powers at eV-scale energies to direct searches for dark matter, neutrino mass measurements, and other physics beyond the standard model.

    "abstract": "           Nanophotonic device design aims to optimize photonic structures to meet specific requirements across various applications. Inverse design has unlocked non-intuitive, high-dimensional design spaces, enabling the discovery of high-performance devices beyond heuristic or analytic methods. The adjoint method, which calculates gradients for all variables using just two simulations, enables efficient navigation of this complex space. However, many inverse-designed structures, while numerically plausible, are difficult to fabricate and sensitive to variations, limiting their practical use. The discrete nature with numerous local-optimal structures also pose significant optimization challenges, often causing gradient-based methods to converge on suboptimal designs. In this work, we formulate inverse design as a fabrication-restricted, discrete, probabilistic optimization problem and introduce BOSON-1, an end-to-end, variation-aware subspace optimization framework to address the challenges of manufacturability, robustness, and optimizability. To overcome optimization difficulty, we propose dense target-enhanced gradient flows to mitigate misleading local optima and introduce a conditional subspace optimization strategy to create high-dimensional tunnels to escape local optima. Furthermore, we significantly reduce the runtime associated with optimizing across exponential variation samples through an adaptive sampling-based robust optimization, ensuring both efficiency and variation robustness. On three representative photonic device benchmarks, our proposed inverse design methodology BOSON^-1 delivers fabricable structures and achieves the best convergence and performance under realistic variations, outperforming prior arts with 74.3% post-fabrication performance.

Our device produces a nearly flat broadband comb with a tunable repetition frequency reaching a bandwidth of 1.8THz at the fundamental repetition rate of 1GHz while remaining fully locked to the RF drive. Comb operation at harmonics of the repetition rate up to 14.1GHz is also demonstrated.

The frequency spacing of the acoustic harmonics corresponds to the laser repetition rate, with the harmonic order reaching beyond one hundred. Remarkably, the acoustic harmonic intensity was found to depend on the CEP of the driving light pulses. Furthermore, the carrier-envelope offset frequency of optical frequency combs can be directly measured in the acoustic spectrum, revealing an ultralong coherence preservation from attoseconds to milliseconds in the light-induced plasma. We demonstrate an application of pulse characterization based on these acoustic harmonic waves.

The excitation of Mie modes of different orders in nanowires causes the enhancement. The in-plane magnetic dipole mode leads to the largest TMOKE enhancement compared to other Mie modes. Changing the width of silicon nanowires leads to a modification of that mode, thereby ensuring the tailoring of the TMOKE within the range of $2.2\\% - 3.8\\%$. This tunability is associated with the modification of the near-field localized at the Si/Ni interface and the far-field response of the excited magnetic dipole mode. Adjusting these two quantities allows one to achieve the highest values of the TMOKE caused by individual Mie modes in silicon nanowires.         ",

ODT bypasses the inherent limitations of 2D integrated quantitative phase imaging methods. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio easy-to-implement common-path shearing interferometry setups are successfully combined with low spatiotemporal coherence of illumination. The need for self-interference generated holograms, with small shear values, critically impedes the analysis of dense and thick samples, e.g., cell cultures, tissue sections, and embryos/organoids. Phase gradient imaging techniques, deployed as a popular solution in the small shear regime, up to now were constrained to 2D integrated quasi-quantitative phase imaging and z-scanning for depth resolution. To fill this significant scientific gap, we propose a novel gradient optical diffraction tomography (GODT) method. The GODT uses coherence-tailored illumination-scanning sequence of phase gradient measurements to tomographically reconstruct, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a derivative of the 3D RI distribution (in the shear direction) with clearly visible 3D sample structure and high sensitivity to its spatial variations. We present a mathematically rigorous theory based on the first-order Rytov approximation behind the new method, validate it using simulations deploying numerical Shepp-Logan target and corroborate experimentally via successful tomographic imaging of the calibrated nano-printed cell phantom and efficient examination of neural cells. This novel imaging modality opens new possibilities in biomedical quantitative phase imaging, advancing the field and putting forward a first of a kind contrast domain: 3D RI gradient.         ",

Due to the lack of effective perception ability of the external electromagnetic environment, there are numerous challenges in the intelligent regulation of wireless channels, and it still relies on external sensors to reshape electromagnetic environment as desired. To address that problem, we propose an adaptive metasurface (AMS) which integrates the capabilities of acquiring wireless environment information and manipulating reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves in a programmable manner. The proposed design endows the metasurfaces with excellent capabilities to sense the complex electromagnetic field distributions around them and then dynamically manipulate the waves and signals in real time under the guidance of the sensed information, eliminating the need for prior knowledge or external inputs about the wireless environment. For verification, a prototype of the proposed AMS is constructed, and its dual capabilities of sensing and manipulation are experimentally validated. Additionally, different integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios with and without the aid of the AMS are established. The effectiveness of the AMS in enhancing communication quality is well demonstrated in complex electromagnetic environments, highlighting its beneficial application potential in future wireless systems.

Intense efforts have been devoted to unveiling how non-Hermiticity may impact the most significant features of topological systems, but only recently it has been theoretically proposed that topological features could originate solely from the system's non-Hermiticity in photonic systems. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss modulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of loss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an Aubry-Andre-Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable integrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different periodic and quasi-periodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show the emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to different kinds of disorder.

A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.

Here, we demonstrate the first electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (EPQSoC) consisting of quantum-correlated photon-pair sources stabilized via on-chip feedback control circuits, all fabricated in a high-volume 45nm CMOS microelectronics foundry. We use non-invasive photocurrent sensing in a tunable microring cavity photon-pair source to actively lock it to a fixed pump laser while operating in the quantum regime, enabling large scale microring-based quantum systems. In this first demonstration of such a capability, we achieve a high CAR of 134 with an ultra-low g(2)(0) of 0.021 at 2.2 kHz off-chip detected pair rate and 3.3 MHz/mW2 on-chip pair generation efficiency, and over 100 kHz off-chip detected pair rate at higher pump powers (1.5 MHz on-chip). These sources maintain stable quantum properties in the presence of temperature variations, operating reliably in practical settings with many adjacent devices creating thermal disturbances on the same chip. Such dense electronic-photonic integration enables implementation and control of quantum-photonic systems at the scale required for useful quantum information processing with CMOS-fabricated chips.

    "abstract": "           We present several nonlinear wavefront sensing techniques for few-mode sensors, all of which are empirically calibrated and agnostic to the choice of wavefront sensor. The first class of techniques involves a straightforward extension of the linear phase retrieval scheme to higher order; the resulting Taylor polynomial can then be solved using the method of successive approximations, though we discuss alternate methods such as homotopy continuation. In the second class of techniques, a model of the WFS intensity response is created using radial basis function interpolation. We consider both forward models, which map phase to intensity and can be solved with nonlinear least-squares methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as well as backwards models which directly map intensity to phase and do not require a solver. We provide demonstrations for both types of techniques in simulation using a quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern wavefront sensor as examples. Next, we demonstrate how the nonlinearity of an arbitrary sensor may studied using the method of numerical continuation, and apply this technique both to the quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern sensor. Finally, we briefly consider the extension of nonlinear techniques to polychromatic sensors.         ",

    "abstract": "           Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.         ",

In order for these observations to be as precise as possible, the $\\gamma$ rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly polarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental configuration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron beam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright, highly polarized beam of $\\gamma$ rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second, after removing the primary electrons, these $\\gamma$ rays collide with another, more intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is possible to measure the $\\gamma$-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and currently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to observe harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition if such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.         ",

Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) technology is at the forefront of replacing current standard CMOS-based control architectures for a number of applications, including quantum computing and quantum sensor arrays. By condensing the control and readout to SFQ-based on-chip devices that are directly connected to the quantum systems, it is possible to minimise the total system overhead, improving scalability and integration. In this work, we present a novel RSFQ device that generates multi tone digital signals, based on complex pulse train sequences using a Circular Shift Register (CSR) and a comb filter stage. We show that the frequency spectrum of the pulse trains is dependent on a preloaded pattern on the CSR, as well as on the delay line of the comb filter stage. By carefully selecting both the pattern and delay, the desired tones can be isolated and amplified as required. Finally, we propose architectures where this device can be implemented to control and readout arrays of quantum devices, such as qubits and single photon detectors.         ",

Here, we introduce a novel method for imaging atomic quantum many-body systems in the continuum, allowing for in situ resolution of every particle. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas. We probe the density correlation functions, resolving their full spatial functional form, and reveal the shape of the Fermi hole arising from Pauli exclusion as a function of temperature.

We measure the ablation plume longitudinal and transverse temperatures, number density, ion production, and spot lifetime for each target.

The other sources produce asymmetric forces driving rotation and spin (self-rotation). Interaction does not need a medium. As achievements, 1) a brief and general equation is derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction: [equation] without using any assumption; 2) electrons and protons are electroneutral, while neutrons are the cold protons with delta T = 6.01 x 10 power 9 K, thus, the heat of nuclear reaction is about 9.18 MeV; 3) atom has isothermal and non-isothermal orbits. Each orbit accommodates 2 electrons with opposite spins; 4) the first ionization energies of elements reported in the references are close to the kinetic energies calculated in this paper; 5) the strengths of chemical bonds and H-bonds are calculated, comparable with the experimental data; 6) vibrations of chemical bonds are discussed which disclose the source of alpha in the system potential.

The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time.

How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction. Overall, many challenges in biology have machine learning analogs, suggesting hypotheses about how biology's circuits are designed.         ",
