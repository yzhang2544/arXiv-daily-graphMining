    "abstract": "           In this contribution, we construct a connection between two quantum voting models presented previously. We propose to try to determine the result of a vote from associated given opinion polls. We introduce a density operator relative to the family of all candidates to a particular election. From an hypothesis of proportionality between a family of coefficients which characterize the density matrix and the probabilities of vote for all the candidates, we propose a numerical method for the entire determination of the density operator. This approach is a direct consequence of the Perron-Frobenius theorem for irreductible positive matrices. We applyour algorithm to synthetic data and to operational results issued from the French presidential election of April 2012.         ",

    "abstract": "           Qualification of high-performance metal components produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) must identify process-induced porous defects that reduce ductility and nucleate fatigue cracking. Detecting such defects via optical monitoring of LPBF provides a path towards in-process quality control without downstream testing such as by computed tomography. However, integration of in-process sensing with LPBF is hampered by geometric and optical complications and, as a result, it has yet to be proven that the finest pores that limit component fatigue life can be resolved via in situ data. We present aperture division multiplexing (ADM) as a method for simultaneously focusing the process laser and providing unobstructed optical access for high-fidelity process monitoring using a common optic. Construction of an ADM optic of achieving imaging at 50 micron spatial resolution in the mid-wave infrared is described, and this optic is demonstrated on a production-representative LPBF testbed. High-speed infrared video data are correlated to micro-CT measurement of pores as fine as 4.3 microns, through multiple process signatures, establishing the promise of ADM for qualification of LPBF component fatigue performance.

    "title": "FLRNet: A Deep Learning Method for Regressive Reconstruction of Flow Field From Limited Sensor Measurements",
    "abstract": "           Many applications in computational and experimental fluid mechanics require effective methods for reconstructing the flow fields from limited sensor data. However, this task remains a significant challenge because the measurement operator, which provides the punctual sensor measurement for a given state of the flow field, is often ill-conditioned and non-invertible. This issue impedes the feasibility of identifying the forward map, theoretically the inverse of the measurement operator, for field reconstruction purposes. While data-driven methods are available, their generalizability across different flow conditions (\\textit{e.g.,} different Reynold numbers) remains questioned. Moreover, they frequently face the problem of spectral bias, which leads to smooth and blurry reconstructed fields, thereby decreasing the accuracy of reconstruction. We introduce FLRNet, a deep learning method for flow field reconstruction from sparse sensor measurements. FLRNet employs an variational autoencoder with Fourier feature layers and incorporates an extra perceptual loss term during training to learn a rich, low-dimensional latent representation of the flow field. The learned latent representation is then correlated to the sensor measurement using a fully connected (dense) network. We validated the reconstruction capability and the generalizability of FLRNet under various fluid flow conditions and sensor configurations, including different sensor counts and sensor layouts. Numerical experiments show that in all tested scenarios, FLRNet consistently outperformed other baselines, delivering the most accurate reconstructed flow field and being the most robust to noise.

    "abstract": "           In a companion paper, we have developed a phase-space electronic structure theory of molecules in magnetic fields, whereby the electronic energy levels arise from diagonalizing a phase-space Hamiltonian $\\hat H_{PS}(\\bf{X},\\bf{\\Pi})$ that depends parametrically on nuclear position and momentum. The resulting eigenvalues are translationally invariant; moreover, if the magnetic field is in the $z-$direction, then the eigenvalues are also invariant to rotations around the $z-$direction. However, like all Hamiltonians in a magnetic field, the theory has a gauge degree of freedom (corresponding to the position of the magnetic origin in the vector potential), and requires either $(i)$ formally, a complete set of electronic states or $(ii)$ in practice, gauge invariant atomic orbitals (GIAOs) in order to realize such translational and rotational invariance. Here we describe how to implement a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian using GIAOs within a practical electronic structure package (in our case, Q-Chem). We further show that novel phenomena can be observed with finite $\\bf{B}-$fields, including minimum energy structures with $\\bf{\\Pi}_{min} \\ne 0$, indicating non-zero electronic motion in the ground-state.

Here we detail novel contributions to spin and orbital angular momentum generated by the gradient of wavefront curvature that becomes relevant in strongly focused beams of light. While circularly polarized beams are shown to develop helicity-dependent transverse spin, a linearly polarized Gaussian beam produces longitudinal spin and orbital angular momenta in the focal region, even if lacking both of these before focusing. Analytical treatment of a nonparaxial electromagnetic field, validated with vectorial diffraction modelling, shows that the terms related to higher orders of a paraxial parameter are responsible for the appearance of non-trivial angular momenta. The obtained dependences relate these quantities to the gradient of the wavefront curvature, showing how it can be used as a novel degree of freedom for applications in optical manipulation and light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales, enabling angular momentum transfer even from a simple Gaussian beam with linear polarization.

Here, we extensively study the SHE and the resultant Spin-Hall shifts (SHS) in optical tweezers (OT) by varying the numerical aperture of objective lenses, and the refractive index (RI) stratification of the trapping medium. Indeed, we obtain much larger values of the SHS for particular combinations of NA and stratification compared to the sub-wavelength orders typically reported. We also observe that the longitudinal component of the spin angular momentum (SAM) density - which is responsible for the spin of birefringent particles in optical tweezers - changes more-or-less monotonically with the lens numerical aperture, except around values of the latter where the angle subtended by the focused light equals the critical angle for a particular RI interface. Our results may find applications in designing experiments for tuning the SHS and SAM induced due to SOI to generate exotic optomechanics of trapped particles in optical tweezers.         ",

    "abstract": "           A fundamental question is understanding the rate at which random quantum circuits converge to the Haar measure. One quantity which is important in establishing this rate is the spectral gap of a random quantum ensemble. In this work we establish a new bound on the spectral gap of the t-th moment of a one-dimensional brickwork architecture on N qudits. This bound is independent of both t and N, provided t does not exceed the qudit dimension q. We also show that the bound is nearly optimal. The improved spectral gaps gives large improvements to the constant factors in known results on the approximate t-design depths of the 1D brickwork, of generic circuit architectures, and of specially-constructed architectures which scramble in depth O(log N). We moreover show that the spectral gap gives the dominant epsilon-dependence of the t-design depth at small epsilon. Our spectral gap bound is obtained by bounding the N-site 1D brickwork architecture by the spectra of 3-site operators. We then exploit a block-triangular hierarchy and a global symmetry in these operators in order to efficiently bound them. The technical methods used are a qualitatively different approach for bounding spectral gaps and and have little in common with previous techniques.         ",

Here, we verify in field the viability of using independent optical frequency combs -- installed at sites separated by a straight-line distance of 300~km -- to achieve a versatile TF-QKD setup that has no need for optical frequency dissemination and thus enables an open and network-friendly fiber configuration. Over 546 and 603 km symmetric links, we record a finite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 0.53~bit/s and an asymptotic SKR of 0.12 bit/s, respectively. Of practical importance, the setup is demonstrated to support 44~km fiber asymmetry in the 452 km link.

We apply this quantum scientific machine learning approach to classify solutions for shock wave detection and turbulence modeling in scenarios where data samples come directly from quantum differential equation solvers.

    "abstract": "           This paper proposes a novel approach that employs error amplification and ADC-based dual-mixer time-difference (ADC-based-DMTD) technique for high-precision locking of laser repetition frequency with compact size. This electronic system consists of two main components: a digitized error amplification module (EAM) and an FPGA-based digital frequency locking module (DFLM). The EAM mainly integrates a configurable frequency generator (CFG), a configurable frequency multiplier (CFM) and a mixer to process the laser pulses and a high-stability reference source (e.g., an atomic clock), enabling high-precision locking of pulse lasers operating at different repetition frequencies. By employing frequency multiplication and mixing, the EAM amplifies the laser's frequency error and performs frequency down-conversion, enhancing measurement sensitivity and reducing the hardware requirements of the back-end. The DFLM receives the EAM outputs by using an ADC-based-DMTD method to precisely measure frequency errors, then the digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller provides feedback to achieve accurate frequency locking. Initial testing with a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) demonstrated excellent locking performance, achieving an Allan deviation of $9.58 \\times 10^{-14}$ at 10 seconds and a standard deviation (STD) of 7.7 \\textmu Hz root mean square (RMS) after locking, marking a five-order-of-magnitude stability enhancement.

    "abstract": "           The quest to enhance the sensitivity of electron spin resonance (ESR) is an ongoing challenge. One potential strategy involves increasing the frequency, for instance, moving from Q-band (approximately 35 GHz) to W-band (approximately 94 GHz). However, this shift typically results in higher transmission and switching losses, as well as increased noise in signal amplifiers. In this work, we address these shortcomings by employing a W-band probehead integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a microresonator. This configuration allows us to position the LNA close to the resonator, thereby amplifying the acquired ESR signal with minimal losses. Furthermore, when operated at cryogenic temperatures, the LNA exhibits unparalleled noise levels that are significantly lower than those of conventional room temperature LNAs. We detail the novel probehead design and provide some experimental results at room temperature as well as cryogenic temperatures for representative paramagnetic samples. We find, for example, that spin sensitivity of ~3*10^5 spins/sqrt(Hz) is achieved for a sample of phosphorus doped 28Si, even for sub-optimal sample geometry with potential improvement to <10^3 spins/sqrt(Hz) in more optimal scenarios.

    "abstract": "           Optical tweezers, with their high precision, dynamic control, and non-invasiveness, are increasingly important in scientific research and applications at the micro and nano scales. However, manipulation by optical tweezers is challenged by adsorption forces, including van der Waals forces, capillary forces, and electrostatic forces, which are present between micro- and nano-objects. Due to the inherent limitations of optical forces imposed by laser power, these adsorption forces are difficult to overcome. Inspired by maglev trains, we propose a multiphysics coupling method that combines dielectrophoretic and optical gradient forces to achieve broad applicability and low-damage micro-nanoscale particle manipulation. We developed a device that introduces electric fields to detach objects from hard substrates using alternating current (AC) dielectric levitation before manipulation with optical tweezers. We utilized micron-sized polystyrene (PS) microspheres as objects and elucidated the levitation mechanism through finite element simulation. For larger particles, such as a 100 {\\mu}m PS microparticle and a 200 {\\mu}m micro-gear, AC dielectric levitation enabled manipulation by optical tweezers. Also, the better viability of three kinds of cells displayed the low bio-damage of the proposed method. Given its broad applicability and biocompatibility, AC dielectric levitation technology significantly expands the capabilities of optical tweezers, allowing for the manipulation of larger particles and cells. This advancement addresses the limitations of optical tweezers in handling large-scale particles and enhances their versatility in various applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Acoustic microfluidic is an important technology in particle manipulations in biomedical analyses and detections. However, the particle-movement manipulations achieved by the standing surface acoustic wave is suitable for particles in a thin layer of fluids, however it is difficult to manipulate particles in deeper solutions due to the energy loss of surface acoustic waves. The traditional standing bulk wave method can realize the particle manipulation in deep solutions, but it cannot work properly for particle manipulation within a long distance due to the energy loss. In this work, the topological rainbow defect-state trapping is realized, the results show that an effect of point accumulation of acoustic pressure in the waveguide path exists, the position of maximum acoustic pressure can be adjusted flexibly by changing the frequency of the incident acoustic wave, based on which, long-distance movement and capture manipulations of particles in deep solution have been realized. The phenomenon presented in this work can provide a reliable method for manipulations of continuous long-distance particle movement and capture to meet the demand of multiple processing steps in biochemical analyses and detections. The experiment verification results will be presented in the near future.         ",

However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.         ",

    "title": "Analytic Model Reveals Local Molecular Polarizability Changes Induced by Collective Strong Coupling in Optical Cavities",
    "abstract": "           Despite recent numerical evidence, one of the fundamental theoretical mysteries of polaritonic chemistry is how and if collective strong coupling can induce local changes of the electronic structure to modify chemical properties. Here we present non-perturbative analytic results for a model system consisting of an ensemble of $N$ harmonic molecules under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that alters our present understanding of this fundamental question. By applying the cavity Born-Oppenheimer partitioning on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in dipole approximation, the dressed many-molecule problem can be solved self-consistently and analytically in the dilute limit. We discover that the electronic molecular polarizabilities are modified even in the case of vanishingly small single-molecule couplings. Consequently, this non-perturbative local polarization mechanism persists even in the large-$N$ limit. In contrast, a perturbative calculation of the polarizabilities leads to a qualitatively erroneous scaling behavior with vanishing effects in the large-$N$ limit. Nevertheless, the exact (self-consistent) polarizabilities can be determined from single-molecule strong coupling simulations instead. Our fundamental theoretical observations demonstrate that hitherto existing collective-scaling arguments are insufficient for polaritonic chemistry and they pave the way for refined single- (or few-) molecule strong-coupling ab-initio simulations of chemical systems under collective strong coupling.

    "abstract": "           Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies of the high-energy excitations on an antiferromagnetic trimer chain, we numerically investigate the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics in this system by applying a magnetic field. The numerical methods we used include the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle, and cluster perturbation theory. From calculating the entanglement entropy, we have revealed the phase diagram which includes the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II, and ferromagnetic phases. Both the critical XY-I and XY-II phases are characterized by the conformal field theory with a central charge $c \\simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamic spin structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime with weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagating of doublons and quartons, respectively. Notably, applying a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectrum into two branches, labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we explore the spin dynamics of a frustrated trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \\ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}. In the end, we extend our discuss on the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation in the trimer systems. Our results are expected to be further verified through the inelastic neutron scattering and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and also provide valuable insights for exploring high-energy exotic excitations.

    "title": "Noise-Robust Detection of Quantum Phase Transitions",
    "abstract": "           Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.

The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\\alpha$, $\\alpha'$, and $\\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.

    "abstract": "           A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.         ",

We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.         ",

Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.         ",
