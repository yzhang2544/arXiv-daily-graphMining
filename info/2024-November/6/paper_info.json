Leveraging the strong electro-optic (Pockels) effect and the scalability of this platform, we demonstrate photonic computation at speeds up to 1.36 TOPS while consuming 0.057 pJ/OP. Our system features more than 100 thin-film lithium niobate high-performance components working synergistically, surpassing state-of-the-art systems on this platform. We further demonstrate binary-classification, handwritten-digit classification, and image classification with remarkable accuracy, showcasing our system's capability of executing real algorithms. Finally, we investigate the opportunities offered by combining our system with a hybrid-integrated distributed feedback laser source and a heterogeneous-integrated modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode. Our results illustrate the promise of thin-film lithium niobate as a computational platform, addressing current bottlenecks in both electronic and photonic computation. Its unique properties of high-performance electro-optic weight encoding and conversion, wafer-scale scalability, and compatibility with integrated lasers and detectors, position thin-film lithium niobate photonics as a valuable complement to silicon photonics, with extensions to applications in ultrafast and power-efficient signal processing and ranging.

Here, we introduce a scalar product, originally devised for radiation fields, to such studies. This scalar product allows one to normalize and compare resonant modes using their corresponding radiation fields. Such fields are polychromatic fields free of divergences, which are determined for any given mode by its complex frequency and the modal field on the surface of the resonator. The scalar product is expressed as a surface integral involving the modal fields, multiplied by a closed-form factor incorporating the complex frequencies. In a practical application, we study the modes of disk-shaped whispering gallery resonators, and we show that the proposed scalar product accurately predicts the geometry-dependent coupling between modes.

Aside from the popular Halbach array that has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array is a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction. In this article, a thorough study of IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design parameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different applications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring array and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility of building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations strongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and homogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a longitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt MRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image quality ans shorten scan time.

For a single ion sitting in the centre of the lattice we observe a state-dependent trap-frequency shift of $2\\pi\\times 3.33(4)$ kHz, corresponding to a bare optical potential of $2\\pi\\times 76.8(5)$ kHz for the electronic ground state. We extend this to two ions, measuring state-dependent shifts of both axial modes. Additionally, using the internal-state dependence of the interaction, we perform a direct measurement of the energy distribution of the motion of a single ion using carrier spectroscopy. Improvements to the setup would allow to increase the state-dependent curvature by more than 50 times, providing a tool which can be utilised for motional state control, and multi-ion gates using optical potentials produced in a scalable fashion.

Photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometers have potential to enable measurement of spectroastrometric signals because the relative intensities between the PL output SMFs contain spatial information on the input scene. In order to use PL output spectra for spectroastrometric measurements, it is important to understand the wavelength-dependent behaviors of PL outputs and develop methods to calibrate the effects of time-varying wavefront errors in ground-based observations. We present experimental characterizations of the 3-port PL on the SCExAO testbed at the Subaru Telescope. We develop spectral response models of the PL and verify the behaviors with lab experiments. We find sinusoidal behavior of astrometric sensitivity of the 3-port PL as a function of wavelength, as expected from numerical simulations. Furthermore, we compare experimental and numerically simulated coupling maps and discuss their potential use for offsetting pointing errors. We then present a method of building PL spectral response models (solving for the transfer matrices as a function of wavelength) using coupling maps, which can be used for further calibration strategies.

Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods.

However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing a clear quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a family of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification performance of the quantum algorithm. The results indicate that the quantum algorithm achieves satisfactory classification accuracy and excels in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score for macroaverage, microaverage, and weighted average methods.

    "abstract": "           Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a unique mechanism of light confinement that holds great potential for fundamental and applied research in optics and photonics. Of particular interest are merging BICs realized in planar periodic structures by merging accidental and symmetry-protected BICs. Topological nature of merging BICs renders their $Q$ factors exceptionally high and robust. However, the existence of accidental BICs relies on the up-down mirror symmetry of the structure. If this symmetry is broken, e.g., by a substrate, the $Q$ factor of the mode drops down. Consequently, ultrahigh-$Q$ merging BICs cannot be achieved in substrate-supported structures. Here, by studying the case of a one-dimensional periodic dielectric grating, we discover a simple method to fully compensate for the detrimental effect of breaking the up-down mirror symmetry. The method makes use of a thin layer of a high-refractive-index dielectric material on one side of the structure, allowing one to restore the diverging $Q$ factor of the accidental BIC and fully recover the merged BIC. By investigating the far-field polarization patterns of the modified gratings, we show that the integer-charge polarization vortices of the accidental BICs are restored by intersecting the momentum-space trajectories of circularly polarized half-vortices simultaneously in the upward and downward radiation directions. Our approach can enable flexible design, feasible realization, and extended applications of topologically robust BICs in various systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.         ",

Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth.

    "abstract": "           The design space for the fabrication of photonic lanterns is vast, which allows for a great diversity of designs but also complicates finding the right parameters for a given component. Coupled-mode theory is a great tool to sort through the parameter space and find the right designs for a multiplicity of photonic lantern types, including conventional, mode-selective, and anything in-between. It correctly models the behavior of the fabricated component, but it also simplifies the task of finding the right fabrication sequence by computing the all-important adiabatic criteria, which dictate which transverse modes will couple, and at which step of the recipe. Here, using coupled-mode theory, we predict and test experimentally the behavior of four types of 3X1 photonic lanterns ranging from conventional to mode-specific and hybrid configurations, and explain mode-coupling, operation bandwidth, and excess loss mechanisms.

    "title": "Strategic Data Re-Uploads: A Pathway to Improved Quantum Classification Data Re-Uploading Strategies for Improved Quantum Classifier Performance",
    "abstract": "           Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.         ",
