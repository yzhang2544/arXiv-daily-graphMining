We identify a particular regime in which this response significantly deviates from the expected two-phonon Raman scattering theory.

This is of particular interest for applications which require high frequency-stability, such as laser frequency stabilization, as by operating the scheme at this specific point would result in the spectral hole frequency being highly immune to temperature fluctuations, providing the potential for a laser fractional frequency instability as low as $\\mathrm{\\sim6\\times10^{-22}}$ at 1 s.

    "abstract": "           We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.

    "abstract": "           Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\u00e9 patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\u00e9 photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\u00e9 cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\u00e9 cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\u00e9 flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.         ",

Here, we exploit a recent breakthrough that generalizes the concept of memory beyond its conventional temporal meaning to also encompass space. Specifically, we leverage our discovery that the dynamics of observables in systems with local couplings satisfy Green's functions with kernels that are local in time and space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short times to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over arbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of finite-size effects. We thus interrogate the \\textit{exact} nonequilibrium formation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only asymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D systems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics, illustrating how energy variations can cause localization -- a phenomenon observable via current microscopy experiments.

    "abstract": "           Optical single-sideband (SSB) modulation features high spectral efficiency, substantial dispersion tolerance, and straightforward detection, making it a versatile technology for applications in optical communications, microwave photonics, optical sensing, satellite communication, etc. However, conventional SSB generators typically require two radio-frequency (RF) signals with a 90\u00b0 phase difference to drive a pair of parallel phase or amplitude modulators, resulting in high system complexity and low power efficiency. In this paper, we propose and realize a simplified SSB generation scheme necessitating only a single RF drive, by achieving effective RF phase shift using on-chip optical delay lines. This approach not only reduces system complexity and saves energy consumption by 3 dB, but also enables easy scalability to higher frequencies. We demonstrate both full-carrier SSB (FC-SSB) and carrier-suppressed SSB (CS-SSB) modulation on thin-film lithium niobate platform. For FC-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.1 dB at 50 GHz and apply it to address the frequency-selective power fading problem in optical communication systems. For CS-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.5 dB and a sideband-to-carrier suppression of 16.9 dB at 50 GHz, which can act as an optical frequency shifter by sweeping the modulation frequencies. Moreover, the shifted optical frequency can be transferred back to the electrical domain by beating with a reference signal generated via a phase modulator on the same chip, achieving broadband RF frequency shifting from a maximum of 50 GHz down to 1 GHz. Our simple, power-efficient, and low-cost SSB modulation scheme could provide an effective solution for future high-frequency direct detection-based communication systems, frequency-modulated continuous wave radar/LiDAR, optical vector network analyzers, and microwave photonics systems.

As we discussed previously, AM-AFM maximizes detection sensitivity when exciting the cantilever at the resonance slope rather than the resonance frequency. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how AM noise depends on the excitation frequency or what the optimal excitation frequency is for the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, no theoretical studies have investigated the noise bandwidth in the closed-loop system of AFM. Here, we formulate a quantitative theory of the minimum detectable force that accounts for the excitation frequency dependence. Our findings indicate that the AM noise dependence on excitation frequency can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator model when the oscillation amplitude exceeds the noise level. Under Brownian noise-limited conditions, the minimum detectable force decreases as the excitation frequency is lowered, approaching the dynamic-mode AFM limit.         ",

    "abstract": "           Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.

The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface.

Several configurations were proposed to produce and accelerate positrons in a single laser stage. However, these configurations have yielded limited positron beam quality and low particle count. This paper presents methods for improving the injection and retention of positrons obtained via Bethe-Heitler pair production and accelerated using direct laser acceleration (DLA) in a plasma channel. The work first introduces a semi-analytical model which predicts laser energy depletion in this highly nonlinear regime. We demonstrate through PIC simulations that accelerated electrons can induce charge inversion within the channel, leading to positron trapping and acceleration. We investigate how laser focusing position, channel wall density, target foil position and target thickness influence positron creation and retention. Our configuration can achieve an 8-fold increase in positron retention compared to previous studies and a higher number of positrons produced overall. This work establishes a robust, single-stage approach for obtaining positron beams, opening new avenues for experiments with Petawatt-class lasers and potential applications in electron-positron collisions and QED cascades.

The present loss-engineered slow-light structure achieves excess losses as low as 0.6 dB/mm experimentally, which is tens of times lower than conventional slow-light structures, and a high modulation bandwidth up to 320GHz in theory is achieved with optimally-designed capacitively-loaded traveling-wave electrodes. Experimentally, the fabricated slow-light modulator with a 2.8-mm-long modulation region has an ultra-low loss-efficiency product of 7.4 VdB and a flat electro-optic response up to 67 GHz, enabling 100-Gbps on-off keying with high ERs of 4.5 dB at a low driving voltage of 2Vpp, while 200-Gbps PAM4 and 150-Gbps PAM8 signals are also generated to show great promise for advanced modulation formats.

    "abstract": "           The interaction between a thin foil target and a circularly polarized laser light injected along an external magnetic field is investigated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations. A standing wave appears at the front surface of the target, overlapping the injected and partially reflected waves. Hot electrons are efficiently generated at the standing wave due to the relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration if the magnetic field amplitude of the standing wave is larger than the ambient field. A bifurcation occurs in the gyration motion of electrons, allowing all electrons with non-relativistic velocities to acquire relativistic energy through the cyclotron resonance. The optimal conditions for the highest energy and the most significant fraction of hot electrons are derived precisely through a simple analysis of test-particle trajectories in the standing wave. Since the number of hot electrons increases drastically by many orders of magnitude compared to the conventional unmagnetized cases, this acceleration could be a great advantage in laser-driven ion acceleration and its applications.

    "abstract": "           Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.         ",

    "abstract": "           Air quality has important climate and health effects. There is a need, therefore, to monitor air quality both indoors and outdoors. Methods of measuring air quality should be cost-effective if they are to be used widely, and one such method is low-cost sensors (LCS). This study reports on the use of LCSs in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to measure $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations inside yurts or \"gers.\" Some of these gers were part of a non-government agency (NGO) initiative to improve the insulating properties of these housing structures. The goal of the NGO was to decrease particulate emissions inside the gers; a secondary result was to lower the use of coal and other biomass material. LCSs were installed in gers heated primarily by coal, and interior air quality was measured. Gers that were modified by increasing their insulating capacities showed a 17.5% reduction in $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations, but these concentrations remained higher than levels recommended by health organizations. Gers that were insulated and used a combination of both coal and electricity showed a 19.1% reduction in $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations. Insulated gers that used electricity for both heating and cooking showed a 48% reduction in $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$, though concentrations were still 6.4 times higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Nighttime and daytime trends followed similar patterns in $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations with slight variations. It was found that, at nighttime, the outside $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations were generally higher than the inside concentrations of the gers in this study. This suggests that $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ would flow into the gers whenever the doors were opened, causing spikes in $\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations.         ",

An optical-FEL (OFEL) utilizes a counter-propagating laser pulse instead of an undulator, and has been proposed as a more compact and tunable source than a FEL. Yet, an OFEL is difficult to realize because of the high electron density required and subsequent high emittance. We demonstrate that broadband coherent XUV light, which in the temporal domain corresponds to a train of attosecond pulses with 8-as duration at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in an optical laser pulse. The symmetry between electrons and positrons in the bunch stabilizes the system and enables the rapid formation of dense microbunches over a ten-micrometer distance instead of the tens of meters typically required in an undulator. The high microbunch density and the stable spectral phase up to emitted photon energies of about 350 eV, allow for the creation of orders of magnitude more compact sources of XUV light that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.

The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE over the wider range of probe field detuning.

The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED.

The thermodynamic properties and the microscopic spatial distribution of the adsorbed hydrogen fluid are assessed within the density functional theory of liquids for quantum fluids at finite temperature (QLDFT), and the adsorption enthalphies are obtained by fitting the computed adsorption densities to the Toth model isotherm. Compared to graphene platelets, the ZnO sheets impose a rather tighter confinement to the motion of the hydrogen molecules parallel to the surface.

Through our simulations, we demonstrate that by using this optimized waveguide geometry, two completely different yet desirable type II phase-matched SPDC processes are enabled using a single poling period.

To be practical for large-scale spectroscopic imaging or photonic quantum computing applications, the size of visible to near-infrared transition-edge sensor arrays and their associated readouts must be increased from a few pixels to many thousands. In this manuscript, we introduce the kinetic inductance current sensor, a scalable readout technology that exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance in a superconducting resonator to make sensitive current measurements. Kinetic inductance current sensors can replace superconducting quantum interference devices for many applications because of their ability to measure fast, high slew-rate signals, their compatibility with standard microwave frequency-division multiplexing techniques, and their relatively simple fabrication.

Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond.

The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range.

Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity. The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability.

    "abstract": "           Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.

    "abstract": "           We propose and numerically demonstrate a novel strategy to achieve dual-band symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) based on a nanodisk tetramer metasurface for lasing generation. The method involves breaking the in-plane symmetry along the diagonal of the metasurface unit cell by introducing air holes in the tetramers. Through our simulations, we show that this flexible approach enables the support of dual-band BICs in the telecom-band range, with these modes evolving into quasi-BICs with remarkably high quality factors by breaking the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, the ultracompact device exhibits the unique characteristic of being polarization-independent across all viewing angles. Finally, the optically pumped gain medium provides sufficient optical gain to compensate the quasi-BIC mode losses, enabling two mode lasing with ultra-low pump threshold and very narrow optical linewidth in the telecom-band range. Our adaptable device paves the way for polarization-insensitive metasurfaces with multiple lasing resonances. This innovation holds the potential to transform areas like low-threshold lasing and biosensing by delivering improved performance and broader capabilities.         ",

    "abstract": "           Complex gene interactions play a significant role in cancer progression, driving cellular behaviors that contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Gene co-expression networks model the functional connectivity between genes under various biological conditions. Understanding the system-level evolution of these networks in cancer is critical for elucidating disease mechanisms and informing the development of targeted therapies. While previous studies have primarily focused on structural differences between cancer and normal cell co-expression networks, this study applies graph frequency analysis to cancer transcriptomic signals defined on gene co-expression networks, highlighting the graph spectral characteristics of cancer systems. Using a range of graph frequency filters, we showed that cancer cells display distinctive patterns in the graph frequency content of their gene transcriptomic signals, effectively distinguishing between cancer types and stages. The transformation of the original gene feature space into the graph spectral space captured more intricate cancer properties, as validated by significantly higher F-statistic scores for graph frequency-filtered gene features compared to those in the original space.
