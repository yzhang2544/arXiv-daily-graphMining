    "title": "After antimatter gravity experiment at CERN -- Prospects of the theory  of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum",
    "abstract": "We start with a summary of the theory of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum, which makes it possible to consider the quantum vacuum as a source of gravity in the Universe. Next, because virtual gravitational dipoles are indispensable for this theory, we suggested different theoretical possibilities for their existence. After that, we consider the first indications that three potential phenomena which, if confirmed, will present a major challenge to the Standard Cosmology, can be explained within the framework of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum; this adds to the already existing successes of the theory. These potential phenomena include: non-Newtonian gravity in internal dynamics of Wide Binary Stars; the existence of massive relic galaxies, as NGC 1277, which is dark matter deficient; a surprisingly fast formation of the first stars and galaxies. Finally, as an example of the complexity of gravitational polarization, we demonstrated the existence of regions with a negative effective gravitational charge; the insufficient understanding of complexity of polarization was reason for premature claims that observations within the Solar System dismiss the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum. All this suggests that recent antimatter gravity experiment at CERN (which proved that atoms and antiatoms have gravitational charge of the same sign and hence ruled out the existence of a particular kind of gravitational dipoles) cannot be considered as a disproof of the theory. The existence of virtual gravitational dipoles and gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum remain open questions and exciting possibilities for a new model of the Universe. ",

The modelling in SMIwiz runs independently: each shot corresponds to one processor in a bijective manner to maximize the scalability.

However, in contrast to the generation of vortex beams in the visible wavelength region, the generation of X-ray vortices in a controlled manner has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this challenge using an X-ray free-electron laser oscillator (XFELO), which can produce intense coherent X-rays with switchable OAM. Using the pinhole mirror in an XFELO, this scheme adjusts only the kinetic energy of the electron beam to produce vortex beams that can be programmed to dynamically change between different OAM modes without the need for additional optical elements. With the nominal parameters of currently constructing 1 MHz repetition rate facility (i.e. SHINE), the active formation of the OAM modes of l = ${\\pm}$1 and l = ${\\pm}$2 and the rapid switching between them by detuning the electron beam energy of the XFELO are numerically illustrated. The real-time switching can be achieved within 200 ${\\mu}$s, while the output pulse energy can reach the 100 ${\\mu}$J level. ",

    "abstract": "Solid-state quantum emitters coupled to integrated photonic nanostructures are quintessential for exploring fundamental phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics and widely employed in photonic quantum technologies such as non-classical light sources, quantum repeaters, and quantum transducers, etc. One of the most exciting promises from integrated quantum photonics is the potential of scalability that enables massive productions of miniaturized devices on a single chip. In reality, the yield of efficient and reproducible light-matter couplings is greatly hindered by the spectral and spatial mismatches between the single solid-state quantum emitters and confined or propagating optical modes supported by the photonic nanostructures, preventing the high-throughput realization of large-scale integrated quantum photonic circuits for more advanced quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we introduce the concept of hyperspectral imaging in quantum optics, for the first time, to address such a long-standing issue. By exploiting the extended mode with a unique dispersion in a 1D planar cavity, the spectral and spatial information of each individual quantum dot in an ensemble can be accurately and reliably extracted from a single wide-field photoluminescence image with super-resolutions. With the extracted quantum dot positions and emission wavelengths, surface-emitting quantum light sources and in-plane photonic circuits can be deterministically fabricated with a high-throughput by etching the 1D confined planar cavity into 3D confined micropillars and 2D confined waveguides. Further extension of this technique by employing an open planar cavity could be exploited for pursuing a variety of compact quantum photonic devices with expanded functionalities for large-scale integration. Our work is expected to change the landscape of integrated quantum photonic technology. ",

Nonclassical crystallization pathways have been observed and analyzed in typical crystalline biominerals, involving the controlled attachment and reconfiguration of nanoparticles and clusters on organic templates. However, the understanding of templated amorphous silica mineralization remains limited, hindering the rational design of complex silica-based materials. Here, we present a systematic study on the stabilization of self-capping cationic silica cluster (CSC) and their assembly dynamics using DNA nanostructures as programmable attachment templates. By tuning the composition and structure of CSC, we demonstrate high-fidelity silicification at single-cluster resolution, revealing a process of adaptive templating involving cooperative adjustments of both the DNA framework and cluster morphology. Our results provide a unified model of silicification by cluster attachment and pave the way towards the molecular tuning of pre- and post-nucleation stages of sol-gel reactions. Overall, our findings provide new insights for the design of silica-based materials with controlled organization and functionality, bridging the gap between biomineralization principles and the rational design of biomimetic material.

Contrary to existing repumping schemes, we directly address lost atoms that spontaneously decayed to the ${\\mathrm{5s4d} ^1\\mathrm{D}_2}$ state, sending them back into the laser cooling cycle by optical pumping on the ${\\mathrm{5s4d} ^1\\mathrm{D}_2} - {\\mathrm{5s8p} ^1\\mathrm{P}_1}$ transition.

Here, we demonstrate the coherent quantum control of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) in the visible regime by coupling plasmon resonances with a two-level quantum emitter (QE). We optimize the spectral response of plasmon-emitter coupled system in the light of coupled harmonic oscillator model. We analyze the shift in the resonance frequency of plasmon modes by varying the transition frequency of QE through external bias voltage. By sweeping the emission linewidth of QE from green to red light, hybrid mode resonance frequency shifts to longer wavelength with maximum energy shift upto 181 meV. Due to coherent coupling of phase-locked modes in the presence of QE, the lifetime of ultrafast plasmon enhances to an order of magnitude. We discuss the impact of spectral and temporal modulation of plasmon resonances on the characteristics of EOT signal through 3D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Our proposed method provides the active electronic control of EOT signal which makes it a feasible and compact element in integrated photonic circuits, for bio-sensing, high resolution imaging, and molecular spectroscopy applications.

First, the metasurface unit-cells are approximated as point sources and, then, the optimization problem is formulated. Afterwards, the proposed method is applied to find the optimal parameter sets on three distinct environments of an ascending complexity and the resulting focus for each case is demonstrated via simulations. The combination of reverberating cavity and a metasurface inside the latter reveals very powerful since everything can be solved analytically for focusing outside the cavity. ",

These include potential applications for communication, computation, information, sensing and metrology, and can extend from the near-infrared with micro-resonator combs, up to the technologically attractive terahertz (THz) frequency range, with powerful and miniaturized quantum cascade laser (QCL) FCs. The recently discovered ability of the QCLs to produce a harmonic frequency comb (HFC), a FC with large intermodal spacings, has attracted new interest in these devices for both applications and fundamental physics, particularly for the generation of THz tones of high spectral purity for high data rate wireless communication networks, for radiofrequency arbitrary waveform synthesis, and for the development of quantum key distributions. The controlled generation of harmonic states of a specific order remains, however, elusive in THz QCLs. Here we devise a strategy to obtain broadband HFC emission of a pre-defined order in QCL, by design. By patterning n regularly spaced defects on the top-surface of a double-metal Fabry-Perot QCL, we demonstrate harmonic comb emission with modes spaced by (n+1) free spectral range and with a record optical power/mode of ~270 $\\mu W$.

Individual atoms are promising candidates for quantum networking due to their capability to emit indistinguishable photons that are entangled with their internal atomic states. Integrating atom arrays with photonic interfaces would enable distributed architectures in which nodes hosting many processing qubits could be efficiently linked together via the distribution of remote entanglement. However, many atom array techniques cease to work in close proximity to photonic interfaces, with atom detection via standard fluorescence imaging presenting a major challenge due to scattering from nearby photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate an architecture that combines atom arrays with up to 64 optical tweezers and a millimeter-scale photonic chip hosting more than 100 nanophotonic devices. We achieve high-fidelity (~99.2%), background-free imaging in close proximity to nanofabricated devices using a multichromatic excitation and detection scheme. The atoms can be imaged while trapped a few hundred nanometers above the dielectric surface, which we verify using Stark shift measurements of the modified trapping potential.

Using this scheme, we demonstrate three examples of classification; in the first, wave functions are classified according to their overlap with predetermined (random) groups. In the second, we classify wave-functions according to their level of localization. Both examples use small training sets and achieve over 90\\% precision and recall. The third classification scheme is a \"real-world problem\", concerning classification of catalytic aromatic-aldehyde substrates according to their reactivity.

However, due to the limitations of present-day quantum hardware, variational-hybrid algorithms introduced to tackle these problems struggle to meet the accuracy and precision requirements of chemical applications. Here, we apply the Quantum Computed Moments (QCM) approach combined with a variety of noise-mitigation techniques to an 8 qubit/spin-orbital representation of the water molecule (H$_2$O). A noise-stable improvement on the variational result for a 4-excitation trial-state (circuit depth 25, 22 CNOTs) was obtained, with the ground-state energy computed to be within $1.4\\pm1.2$ mHa of exact diagonalisation in the 14 spin-orbital basis. Thus, the QCM approach, despite an increased number of measurements and noisy quantum hardware (CNOT error rates c.1% corresponding to expected error rates on the trial-state circuit of order 20%), is able to determine the ground-state energy of a non-trivial molecular system at the required accuracy (c.0.1%). To the best of our knowledge, these results are the largest calculations performed on a physical quantum computer to date in terms of encoding individual spin-orbitals producing chemically relevant accuracy, and a promising indicator of how such hybrid approaches might scale to problems of interest in the low-error/fault-tolerant regimes as quantum computers develop.

    "abstract": "Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \\times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures. ",

    "title": "Sparse Quantum State Preparation for Strongly Correlated Systems",
    "abstract": "Quantum Computing allows, in principle, the encoding of the exponentially scaling many-electron wave function onto a linearly scaling qubit register, offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional quantum chemistry methods. An essential requirement for ground state quantum algorithms to be practical is the initialisation of the qubits to a high-quality approximation of the sought-after ground state. Quantum State Preparation (QSP) allows the preparation of approximate eigenstates obtained from classical calculations, but it is frequently treated as an oracle in quantum information. In this study, we conduct QSP on the ground state of prototypical strongly correlated systems, up to 28 qubits, using the Hyperion GPU-accelerated state-vector emulator. Various variational and non-variational methods are compared in terms of their circuit depth and classical complexity. Our results indicate that the recently developed Overlap-ADAPT-VQE algorithm offers the most advantageous performance for near-term applications. ",
