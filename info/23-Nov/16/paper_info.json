    "abstract": "The primary accelerator of DCLS (Dalian Coherent Light Source) operates at a repetition rate of 20 Hz now, and the beam is divided at the end of the linear accelera-tor through Kicker to make two 10 Hz beamlines work simultaneously. For the simultaneous emission FEL of two beamlines, the beam energy of the two beamlines is required to be controlled independently, so we need to set the amplitude and phase of each beamline. This paper implements a microwave amplitude and phase setting function based on event timing. We upgraded the EVG/EVR event timing system and LLRF (Low-Level Radiofrequency) system. Two special event codes and a repetition rate division of 10 Hz are added to the event timing system, and we can set the microwave amplitude and phase by judging the event code in LLRF. We ulti-mately perform the microwave triggering at a repetition rate of 10 Hz for each beamline and validate this function through beam experiments. ",

The natural oscillation frequency, normalized by the capillary frequency, is {mainly} a function of the equilibrium contact angle and the Bond number (Bo), when the contact lines remain pinned. Parametric numerical and experimental studies have been performed to establish a comprehensive understanding of oscillation dynamics. {An} inviscid model has been developed to predict the oscillation frequency for wide ranges of Bo and contact angles. The model reveals the scaling relation between the normalized frequency and Bo, which is validated by the numerical simulation results. For a given equilibrium contact angle, the lateral oscillation frequency decreases with Bo, implying that resonance frequencies will be magnified if the drop oscillations occur in a reduced gravity environment.

    "abstract": "In the field of integrated sensing and communication, there's a growing need for advanced environmental perception. The terahertz (THz) frequency band, significant for ultra-high-speed data connections, shows promise in environmental sensing, particularly in detecting surface textures crucial for autonomous system's decision-making. However, traditional numerical methods for parameter estimation in these environments struggle with accuracy, speed, and stability, especially in high-speed scenarios like vehicle-to-everything communications. This study introduces a deep learning approach for identifying surface roughness using a 140-GHz setup tailored for high-speed conditions. A high-speed data acquisition system was developed to mimic real-world scenarios, and a diverse set of rough surface samples was collected for realistic high-speed datasets to train the models. The model was trained and validated in three challenging scenarios: random occlusions, sparse data, and narrow-angle observations. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in high-speed conditions, suggesting terahertz frequencies' potential in future sensing and communication applications. ",

    "abstract": "Self-adaptive thermoregulation, the mechanism living organisms use to balance their temperature, holds great promise for decarbonizing cooling and heating processes. The functionality can be effectively emulated by engineering the thermal emissivity of materials to adapt to background temperature variations. Yet, solutions that marry large emissivity switching (${\\Delta}\\epsilon$) with scalability, cost-effectiveness and design freedom are still lacking. Here, we fill this gap by introducing infrared dipole antennas made of tunable thermochromic materials. We demonstrate that non-spherical antennas (rods, stars and flakes) made of vanadium-dioxide can exhibit a massive (~200-fold) increase in their absorption cross-section as temperature rises. Embedding these antennas in polymer films, or simply spraying them directly, creates free-form thermoregulation composites, featuring an outstanding ${\\Delta}\\epsilon\\sim0.6$ in spectral ranges that can be tuned at will.

When increasing the magnitude of the non-Hermitian terms, the system undergoes transitions from topological corner states to topological edge states and subsequently to topological bulk states. The angular momentum of the wave function of the out-of-plane electric field excited by the chiral source acts as the pseudospin degree of freedom in the PQSHE. Therefore, we consider the introduction of chiral sources with different circular polarizations into non-Hermitian PhCs and observe the emergence of asymmetric field responses.

These effects create a peculiar resonant-scattering configuration, similar to the classical reflective Gires-Tournois etalon, but in transmission, providing full 2pi phase modulation with constant transmittance near 100%. Most importantly, this effect persists over an extremely wide band, associated with topological effects. Hence, our proposed approach produces a spectrally and parametrically robust pure-phase resonance effect in transmission, which is highly beneficial for practical applications. ",

In particular, we apply the averaged electronic friction from the metal surface to the centroid mode of the ring polymer. We benchmark our approach against quantum dynamics to show that electronic friction with RPMD (EF-RPMD) can capture zero-point energy as well as transition dynamics accurately. In addition, we show EF-RPMD can correctly predict the electronic transfer rate near metal surfaces in the tunneling limit as well as the barrier crossing limit.

Here we report on a novel approach to reversible imprinting of a holographic mask in an electronic Wigner crystal material with a sub-90 nm feature size. The structure is imprinted on a sub-picosecond time-scale using EUV laser pulses and acts as a high-efficiency diffraction grating that deflects EUV or soft X-ray light. The imprinted nanostructure is stable after the removal of the exciting beams at low temperatures but can be easily erased by a single heating beam. Modeling shows that the efficiency of the device can exceed 1%, approaching state-of-the-art etched gratings, but with the benefit of being programmable and tunable over a large range of wavelengths. The observed effect is based on the rapid change of lattice constant upon transition between metastable electronically-ordered phases in a layered transition metal dichalcogenide. The proposed approach is potentially useful for creating tunable light modulators in the EUV and soft X-ray spectral ranges. ",

    "abstract": "The row-column addressed array is an emerging probe for ultrafast 3-D ultrasound imaging. It achieves this with far fewer independent electronic channels and a wider field of view than traditional 2-D matrix arrays, of the same channel count, making it a good candidate for clinical translation. However, the image quality of row-column arrays is generally poor, particularly when investigating tissue. Ultrasound localisation microscopy allows for the production of super-resolution images even when the initial image resolution is not high. Unfortunately, the row-column probe can suffer from imaging artefacts that can degrade the quality of super-resolution images as `secondary' lobes from bright microbubbles can be mistaken as microbubble events, particularly when operated using plane wave imaging. These false events move through the image in a physiologically realistic way so can be challenging to remove via tracking, leading to the production of 'false vessels'. Here, a new type of rolling window image reconstruction procedure was developed, which integrated a row-column array-specific coherence-based beamforming technique with acoustic sub-aperture processing for the purposes of reducing `secondary' lobe artefacts, noise and increasing the effective frame rate. Using an {\\it{in vitro}} cross tube, it was found that the procedure reduced the percentage of `false' locations from $\\sim$26\\% to $\\sim$15\\% compared to traditional orthogonal plane wave compounding. Additionally, it was found that the noise could be reduced by $\\sim$7 dB and that the effective frame rate could be increased to over 4000 fps.

Since the ruling out of equilibrium CTCs by no-go theorems, the emergence of such dynamical phases has been observed in various driven-dissipative quantum platforms. The current understanding of CTCs is mainly based on mean-field (MF) theories, which fail to address the problem of whether the long-range time crystalline order exists in noisy, spatially extended systems without the protection of all-to-all couplings. Here, we propose a new kind of CTC realized in a quantum contact model through self-organized bistability (SOB). The exotic CTCs stem from the interplay between collective dissipation induced by the first-order absorbing phase transitions (APTs) and slow constant driving provided by an incoherent pump. The stability of such oscillatory phases in finite dimensions under the action of intrinsic quantum fluctuations is scrutinized by the functional renormalization group method and numerical simulations. Occurring at the edge of quantum synchronization, the CTC phase exhibits an inherent period and amplitude with a coherence time diverging with system size, thus also constituting a boundary time crystal (BTC). Our results serve as a solid route towards self-protected CTCs in strongly interacting open systems. ",

We consider hybrid stochastic agent-based models of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis (new blood vessel creation from pre-existing vasculature), which treat cells as individuals that are guided by underlying continuous chemical and/or mechanical fields. In these descriptions, leader (tip) cells emerge from existing branches and follower (stalk) cells build the new sprout in their wake. Vessel branching and fusion (anastomosis) occur as a result of tip and stalk cell dynamics. Coarse-graining these hybrid models in appropriate limits produces continuum partial differential equations (PDEs) for endothelial cell densities that are more analytically tractable. While these models differ in nonlinearity, they produce similar equations at leading order when chemotaxis is dominant. We analyze this leading order system in a simple quasi-one-dimensional geometry and show that the numerical solution of the leading order PDE is well described by a soliton wave that evolves from vessel to source. This wave is an attractor for intermediate times until it arrives at the hypoxic region releasing the growth factor. The mathematical techniques used here thus identify common features of discrete and continuum approaches and provide insight into general biological mechanisms governing their collective dynamics. ",
