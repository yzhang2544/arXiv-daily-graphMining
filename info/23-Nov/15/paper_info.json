    "title": "Crown ether decorated silicon photonics for safeguarding against lead  poisoning",
    "abstract": "Lead (Pb2+) toxification in society is one of the most concerning public health crisis that remains unaddressed. The exposure to Pb2+ poisoning leads to a multitude of enduring health issues, even at the part-per-billion scale (ppb). Yet, public action dwarfs its impact. Pb2+ poisoning is estimated to account for 1 million deaths per year globally, which is in addition to its chronic impact on children. With their ring-shaped cavities, crown ethers are uniquely capable of selectively binding to specific ions. In this work, for the first time, the synergistic integration of highly-scalable silicon photonics, with crown ether amine conjugation via Fischer esterification in an environmentally-friendly fashion is demonstrated. This realises a photonic platform that enables the in-situ, highly-selective and quantitative detection of various ions. The development dispels the existing notion that Fischer esterification is restricted to organic compounds, laying the ground for subsequent amine conjugation for various crown ethers. In this work, the platform is engineered for Pb2+ detection, demonstrating a large dynamic detection range of 1 - 262000 ppb with high selectivity against a wide range of relevant ions. These results indicate the potential for the pervasive implementation of the technology to safeguard against ubiquitous lead poisoning in our society. ",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a broadband acousto-optic notch filter based on a tubular-lattice hollow-core fiber for the first time. The guided optical modes are modulated by acoustically induced dynamic long-period gratings along the fiber. The device is fabricated employing a short interaction length (7.7 cm) and low drive voltages (10 V). Modulated spectral bands with 20 nm half-width and maximum depths greater than 60 % are achieved. The resonant notch wavelength is tuned from 743 to 1355 nm (612 nm span) by changing the frequency of the electrical signal. The results indicate a broader tuning range compared to previous studies using standard and hollow-core fibers. It further reveals unique properties for reconfigurable spectral filters and fiber lasers, pointing to the fast switching and highly efficient modulation of all-fiber photonic devices. ",

However, a complete theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the modifications remains elusive due to the complexity of the hybrid system, especially the collective nature of polaritonic states in systems containing many molecules. We develop here the semiclassical theory of molecular-vibration-polariton dynamics based on the truncated Wigner approximation that is tractable in large molecular systems and simultaneously captures the quantum character of photons in the optical cavity. The theory is then applied to investigate the nuclear dynamics of a system of identical diatomic molecules having the ground-state Morse potential and strongly coupled to an infrared cavity mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The collective and resonance effects of the molecular-vibration-polariton formation on the nuclear dynamics are observed. ",

This paper comprehensively investigates terahertz channel performance under such conditions, employing a measurement setup operational between 113 and 170 GHz. Analyzing scenarios frequently induced by human activity and environmental factors, like door movements, we established a comprehensive theoretical model. This model seamlessly integrates transmission, reflection, absorption, and diffraction mechanisms, leveraging the Fresnel formula, multi-layer transmission paradigm, and knife-edge diffraction theory. Our experimental results and theoretical predictions harmoniously align, revealing intricate dependencies, such as increased power loss at higher frequencies and larger incident angles. Furthermore, door interactions, whether opening or oscillations, significantly impact the terahertz channel. Notably, door edges lead to a power blockage surpassing the transmission loss of the glass itself but remaining inferior to metallic handle interferences. This paper's insights are pivotal for the design and fabrication of terahertz communication systems within indoor settings, pushing the boundaries of efficient and reliable communication. ",

    "abstract": "Self-organization of temporal modes in mode-locked lasers usually starts from quantum noise. In this process, incoherent spontaneous emission is steered into coherent ultrashort pulses by dissipation and nonlinearity. In this work, we investigated self-organization dynamics in a mode-locked Mamyshev oscillator starting from coherent pulse seeds as opposed to quantum noise. We observed that the coherence of the seed can be remembered or forgotten depending on the initial inverse population. The excessive nonlinearity in the coherence amnesia regime can devastate the seed coherence, causing the oscillator to undergo a chaotic transition lasting hundreds of round trips before regaining coherence. Conversely, the oscillator converges in only a few round trips for the coherence memory regime. A heterodyne technique was developed to record the fast varying optical phase and characterize these two regimes. Dissipative soliton molecules were synthesized from external pulse pair seeds via the coherence memory pathway. In this case, a plateau of the generated pulse spacing independent from seed pulse spacing, i.e., amnesia of the seed spacing, was observed for close spaced seed pulse pairs. Moreover, we show that pulse seeds can be used for laser reconfiguration and pulse pattern control. Our work paves a way to control transient pulse dynamics and steady pulse forms on demand in mode-locked lasers. ",

The proposed sensors are evaluated against first-order analytical functions and finite element models, before experimentally validating the predicted phenomenon for the different sensor configurations. The simulated and experimental results show excellent agreement and first-order best-fit functions are employed to predict displacement variables experimentally. Co-planar separation and angular displacement are shown to be experimentally predictable to within $\\pm1mm$ and $\\pm1^o$ using this approach. This study validates the first-order physics-based models employed, and demonstrates the first proof-of-principle for using resonant phenomena in inductive array sensors for evaluating relative displacement between array elements.

The PnC is composed of steel cylinders arranged in a square lattice within a water matrix with defects induced by selectively removing cylinders to create Mach-Zehnder-like (MZ) defect-based interferometers. Two defect-based acoustic interferometers of MZ-type are fabricated, one with arms oriented horizontally and another one with arms oriented diagonally, and their transmission features are experimentally characterized using ultrasonic spectroscopy. The experimental data are compared with finite element method (FEM) simulations and with tight-binding (TB) calculations in which each defect is treated as a resonator coupled to its neighboring ones. Significantly, the results exhibit excellent agreement indicating the reliability of the proposed approach. This comprehensive match is of paramount importance for accurately predicting and optimizing resonant modes supported by defect arrays, thus enabling the tailoring of phononic structures and defect-based waveguides to meet specific requirements. This successful implementation of FEM and TB calculations in investigating CRAWs systems within phononic crystals paves the way for designing advanced acoustic devices with desired functionalities for various practical applications, demonstrating the application of solid-state electronics principles to underwater acoustic devices description.

We identified the clear underlying physics that governs the suppression of the radiative losses in particular geometries. However, we reveal that the specific configurations in small ensembles are not easily predictable based on the knowledge established for the arrays of large size. In particular, the states that inherit their properties from bound states in continuum in infinite lattices turn out to be the most subradiant in a wide range of $r_{min}$ values. We also show that for small interatomic distance the chains with modulated interatomic distances exhibit fast exponential decrease of the radiative losses with the size of the ensemble. ",

    "abstract": "A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of physical process, products and/or systems that requires a high-fidelity computational model for continuous update through the integration of sensor data and user input. In the context of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing, a digital twin of the manufacturing process can offer predictions for the produced parts, diagnostics for manufacturing defects, as well as control capabilities. This paper introduces a parameterized physics-based digital twin (PPB-DT) for the statistical predictions of LPBF metal additive manufacturing process. We accomplish this by creating a high-fidelity computational model that accurately represents the melt pool phenomena and subsequently calibrating and validating it through controlled experiments. In PPB-DT, a mechanistic reduced-order method-driven stochastic calibration process is introduced, which enables the statistical predictions of the melt pool geometries and the identification of defects such as lack-of-fusion porosity and surface roughness, specifically for diagnostic applications. Leveraging data derived from this physics-based model and experiments, we have trained a machine learning-based digital twin (PPB-ML-DT) model for predicting, monitoring, and controlling melt pool geometries. These proposed digital twin models can be employed for predictions, control, optimization, and quality assurance within the LPBF process, ultimately expediting product development and certification in LPBF-based metal additive manufacturing.

In the optical domain, high levels of vacuum noise squeezing are possible due to the availability of low loss optical components and high-performance squeezers. At microwave frequencies, however, limitations of the squeezing devices and the high insertion loss of microwave components makes squeezing vacuum noise an exceptionally difficult task. Here we demonstrate a new record for the direct measurement of microwave squeezing. We use an ultra low loss setup and weakly-nonlinear kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers to squeeze microwave noise 7.8(2) dB below the vacuum level. The amplifiers exhibit a resilience to magnetic fields and permit the demonstration of record squeezing levels inside fields of up to 2 T. Finally, we exploit the high critical temperature of our amplifiers to squeeze a warm thermal environment, achieving vacuum level noise at a temperature of 1.8 K. These results enable experiments that combine squeezing with magnetic fields and permit quantum-limited microwave measurements at elevated temperatures, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the cryogenic systems required for such experiments.

    "abstract": "An exactly solvable model of a trapped interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coupled in the dipole approximation to a quantized light mode in a cavity is presented. The model can be seen as a generalization of the harmonic-interaction model for a trapped BEC coupled to a bosonic bath. After obtaining the ground-state energy and wavefunction in closed form, we focus on computing the correlations in the system. The reduced one-particle density matrices of the bosons and the cavity are constructed and diagonalized analytically, and the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the BEC and the cavity is also expressed explicitly as a function of the number and mass of the bosons, frequencies of the trap and cavity, and the cavity-boson coupling strength. The results allow one to study the impact of the cavity on the bosons and vice versa on an equal footing. As an application we investigate a specific case of basic interest for itself, namely, non-interacting bosons in a cavity. We find that both the bosons and the cavity develop correlations in a complementary manner while increasing the coupling between them. Whereas the cavity wavepacket broadens in Fock space, the BEC density saturates in real space. On the other hand, while the cavity depletion saturates, and hence does the BEC-cavity entanglement entropy, the BEC becomes strongly correlated and eventually increasingly fragmented. The latter phenomenon implies single-trap fragmentation of otherwise ideal bosons, where their induced long-range interaction is mediated by the cavity. Finally, as a complimentary investigation, the mean-field equations for the BEC-cavity system are solved analytically as well, and the breakdown of mean-field theory for the cavity and the bosons with increasing coupling is discussed. Further applications are envisaged. ",

The method is time efficient and the outcomes greatly surpass the results of manual searches used so far. We discover new laser cooling schemes for C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, YO, and CO$_2$ that can be viewed as surprising or counterintuitive compared to previously identified laser cooling schemes. In addition, a central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance our ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also be applicable to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states. ",
