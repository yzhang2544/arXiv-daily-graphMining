    "title": "Fabrication of Sawfish photonic crystal cavities in bulk diamond",
    "abstract": "Color centers in diamond are quantum systems with optically active spin-states that show long coherence times and are therefore a promising candidate for the development of efficient spin-photon interfaces. However, only a small portion of the emitted photons is generated by the coherent optical transition of the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which limits the overall performance of the system. Embedding these emitters in photonic crystal cavities improves the coupling to the ZPL photons and increases their emission rate. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication process of \"Sawfish\" cavities, a design recently proposed that has the experimentally-realistic potential to simultaneously enhance the emission rate by a factor of 46 and couple photons into a single-mode fiber with an efficiency of 88%. The presented process allows for the fabrication of fully suspended devices with a total length of 20.5 $\\mu$m and features size as small as 40 nm. The optical characterization shows fundamental mode resonances that follow the behavior expected from the corresponding design parameters and quality (Q) factors as high as 3825. Finally, we investigate the effects of nanofabrication on the devices and show that, despite a noticeable erosion of the fine features, the measured cavity resonances deviate by only 0.9 (1.2)% from the corresponding simulated values. This proves that the Sawfish design is robust against fabrication imperfections, which makes it an attractive choice for the development of quantum photonic networks. ",

While the floating zone method has been constantly evolving for over six decades, the development of high-pressure (up to 1000 bar) growth systems has only recently been realized via the combination of laser-based heating sources with an all-metal chamber. While our inaugural high-pressure laser floating zone furnace design demonstrated the successful growth of new volatile and metastable phases, the furnace design faces several limitations with imaging quality, heating profile control, and chamber cooling power. Here, we present a second-generation design of the high-pressure laser floating zone furnace, \"LOKII\", and demonstrate that this redesign facilitates new advances in crystal growth by highlighting several exemplar materials: $\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and La$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$.

    "abstract": "Space-division multiplexing (SDM) is one of the key enabling technologies to increase the capacity of fiber communication systems. However, implementing SDM-based systems using multimode fiber has been challenging with the need for compact, low-cost, and scalable mode de/multiplexer (DE/MUX). Here we present a novel integrated mode MUX for few-mode fibers (FMFs) which can launch up to eight spatial and polarization channels. The new design is composed of a two-dimensional multimode grating coupler (MMGC), highly compact mode size converters (MSCs), and adiabatic directional couplers (ADCs). Eight data lanes in FMFs can be selectively launched with integrated optical phase shifters. Experimental results reveal efficient chip-to-fiber coupling with peak efficiencies of -3.8 dB, -5.5 dB, -3.6 dB, and -4.1 dB for LP01, LP11a, LP11b, and LP21b modes, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed design can efficiently couple all the degenerate LP modes in a two-mode FMF, allowing signal descrambling in the demultiplexer. Thanks to the use of integrated subwavelength Mikaelian lens for mode-independent field size conversion with loss $\\leq$0.25 dB, the total footprint of the MMGC and MSCs is only 35x35 $\\mu$m$^{2}$. The proposed design shows great potential for densely integrated photonic circuits in future SDM applications. ",

    "abstract": "We generalize the concept of optical scattering matrix ($S$-matrix) to characterize harmonic generation and frequency mixing in planar metasurfaces in the limit of undepleted pump approximation. We show that the symmetry properties of such nonlinear $S$-matrix are determined by the microscopic and macroscopic symmetries of the metasurface. We demonstrate that for description of degenerate frequency mixing processes such as optical harmonic generation, the multidimensional $S$-matrix can be replaced with a reduced two-dimensional $S$-matrix. We show that for metasurfaces possessing specific point group symmetries, the selection rules determining the transformation of the reduced nonlinear $S$-matrix are simplified substantially and can be expressed in a compact form. We apply the developed approach to analyse chiral harmonic generation in nonlinear metasurfaces with various symmetries including rotational, in-plane mirror, and out-of-plane mirror symmetries. For each of those symmetries, we confirm the results of the developed analysis by full-wave numerical calculations. We believe our results provide a new paradigm for engineering nonlinear optical properties of metasurfaces which may find applications in active and nonlinear optics, biosensing, and quantum information processing.

Manipulating exciton polaritons often requires external control over the electrical and optical properties of materials. Here we demonstrate the electrical control of 2D exciton polaritons by strongly coupling a transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) heterostructure to a photonic crystal nanocavity. Through precise control of the doping level in the TMD monolayers using electrostatic gating, we demonstrate a wide range of tunability in the exciton oscillator strength and hence the exciton photon hybridization. This tunability leads to the demonstration of a continuous transition from weak to strong coupling regime, as manifested by the disappearance and emergence of exciton polaritons, showcasing the versatility of our approach. Our work paves the way to further exploring nonlinear and quantum exciton polaritons in 2D materials and their device applications. ",

When the laser light is strongly focused, but still paraxial, its e/m field is characterized by a longitudinal component which is of magnitude comparable to the transverse ones and which has been ignored in the theoretical analysis of the tweezing forces. In our work we revise the calculations of the various components of the radiation pressure force, within the limits of Rayleigh regime or dipole approximation, in the case where a tiny particle interacts, in free space, with a circularly polarized optical vortex beam, by taking into account this ignored field term. We show that this term is responsible for considerable modifications in the magnitude of the various components, moreover and also for the appearance of terms involving the coupling of the spin angular momentum (SAM) and the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the photons of the vortex beam. We compare our findings with the ones taken ignoring the longitudinal field component. ",

    "abstract": "For more than five decades, a notable spread in the low frequencies of velocity and temperature spectra, scaled using inertial subrange properties and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, has been observed in unstable stratification. A large ensemble of 14 datasets, over relatively simple terrain (from flat and homogeneous to gentle slope or valley floor) and very complex terrain (steep slope, crater rim, mountain top), are used to assess the reasons of this low-frequency behaviour. Turbulence anisotropy is shown to be the primary factor influencing the spectral energy at the largest scales and the spectral peak position of streamwise and spanwise velocity spectra, with stability acting as a secondary factor. On the contrary, the low-frequency behaviour of surface-normal and temperature spectra is dominated by stability effects, while turbulence anisotropy plays a secondary role. These observations are valid over both simple and complex terrain, even though variability of the largest scales of complex terrain datasets integrate other processes not included in turbulence anisotropy or stability conditions. Using a combination of non-dimensional turbulence parameters - temperature and velocity variances as well as dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy and of temperature variance - and of a semi-empirical model provided in the literature, we are able to describe the behaviour of the velocity and temperature spectra with only turbulence anisotropy and stability as input parameters. Finally, the paper provides some insights into the nature of anisotropic eddies, as well as the relationship between the boundary layer height and the spectral behaviour. ",

Specifically, our proposed tGT-OCT utilizes an unsupervised 3D-convolution deep-learning network trained using random 3D volumetric data to distinguish and separate speckle from real structures in 3D imaging volumetric space; moreover, tGT-OCT effectively further reduces speckle noise and reveals structures that would otherwise be obscured by speckle noise while preserving spatial resolution. Results derived from different samples demonstrated the high-quality speckle-free 3D imaging performance of tGT-OCT and its advancement beyond the previous state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Increasing the efficiency and reducing the footprint of on-chip photodetectors enables dense optical interconnects for emerging computational and sensing applications. Avalanche photodetectors (APD) are currently the dominating on-chip photodetectors. However, the physics of avalanche multiplication leads to low energy efficiencies and prevents device operation at a high gain, due to a high excess noise, resulting in the need for electrical amplifiers. These properties significantly increase power consumption and footprint of current optical receivers. In contrast, heterojunction phototransistors (HPT) exhibit high efficiency and very small excess noise at high gain. However, HPT's gain-bandwidth product (GBP) is currently inferior to that of APDs at low optical powers. Here, we demonstrate that the type-II energy band alignment in an antimony-based HPT results in a significantly smaller junction capacitance and higher GBP at low optical powers. We used a CMOS-compatible heterogeneous integration method to create compact optical receivers on silicon with an energy efficiency that is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the best reported integrated APDs on silicon at a similar GBP of 270 GHz. Bitrate measurements show data rate spatial density above 800 Tbps per mm2, and an energy-per-bit consumption of only 6 fJ/bit at 3 Gbps. These unique features suggest new opportunities for creating highly efficient and compact on-chip optical receivers based on devices with type-II band alignment. ",

    "abstract": "The assembling of twisted stacks of van der Waals (vdW) materials had led to the discovery of a profusion of remarkable physical phenomena in recent years, as it provides a means to accurately control and harness electronic band structures. This has given birth to the so-called field of twistronics. An analogous concept has been developed for highly confined polaritons, or nanolight, in twisted bilayers of strongly anisotropic vdW materials, extending the field to the twistoptics realm. In this case, the emergence of a topological transition of the polaritonic dispersion at a given twist angle (photonic magic angle) results in the propagation of nanolight along one specific direction (canalization regime), holding promises for unprecedented control of the flow of energy at the nanoscale. However, there is a fundamental limitation in twistoptics that critically impedes such control: there is only one photonic magic angle (and thus canalization direction) in a twisted bilayer and it is fixed for each incident frequency. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating the existence of multiple spectrally robust photonic magic angles in reconfigurable twisted vdW trilayers. As a result, we show that canalization of nanolight can be programmed at will along any desired in-plane direction in a single device, and, importantly, within broad spectral ranges of up to 70 cm-1. Our findings lay the foundation for robust and widely tunable twistoptics, opening the door for applications in nanophotonics where on-demand control of energy at the nanoscale is crucial, such as thermal management, nanoimaging or entanglement of quantum emitters.

In addition, we observe the formation of a plasma channel, extending longitudinally across the gas density maximum and expanding radially with time. These results are well captured by large-scale particle-in-cell simulations, which reveal that the detected fast ions most likely originate from reflection off the rapidly expanding channel walls. The latter process is predicted to yield ion energies in the MeV range, which compare well with the measurements.

    "abstract": "Lasers with high spectral purity are indispensable for optical clocks and coherent manipulation of atomic and molecular qubits for applications such as quantum computing and quantum simulation. Stabilisation of the laser to a reference can provide a narrow linewidth and high spectral purity. However, widely-used diode lasers exhibit fast phase noise that prevents high fidelity qubit manipulation. Here we demonstrate a self-injection locked diode laser system utilizing a medium finesse cavity. The cavity not only provides a stable resonance frequency, but at the same time acts as a low-pass filter for phase noise beyond the cavity linewidth of around 100 kHz, resulting in low phase noise from dc to the injection lock limit. We model the expected laser performance and benchmark it using a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$-ion as a spectrum analyser. We show that the fast phase noise of the laser at relevant Fourier frequencies of 100 kHz to >2 MHz is suppressed to a noise floor of between -110 dBc/Hz and -120 dBc/Hz, an improvement of 20 to 30 dB over state-of-the-art Pound-Drever-Hall-stabilized extended-cavity diode lasers. This strong suppression avoids incoherent (spurious) spin flips during manipulation of optical qubits and improves laser-driven gates in using diode lasers with applications in quantum logic spectroscopy, quantum simulation and quantum computation.

We consider cascaded optical $\\chi^{(2)}$ (quadratic) nonlinearities as an example and show that the dynamics can be construed (to leading order) as self-phase modulations of dressed fundamental modes plus cross-phase modulations of dressed fundamental and second-harmonic modes. We then formally eliminate the second-harmonic degrees of freedom and identify emergent features of the fundamental wave dynamics, such as two-photon loss channels, and examine conditions for accuracy of the reduced model in dispersive and dissipative parameter regimes. Our results highlight the utility of system-reservoir methods for deriving accurate, intuitive reduced models for complex dynamics in broadband nonlinear quantum photonics. ",

A scalar quantization method which is in development is used for lossless compression of ADC raw data, the process board will decompress the ADC data and perform a digital algorithm to measure the amplitude and phase of the high frequency signal. This de-sign is scalable for testing and upgradability, mean-while, the trigger-less data transmission enable this system participate in both local (rack-scale) and accelerator-wide communication networks.

    "abstract": "Low latency and low power consumption are the main goals for our future networks. Fiber optics are already widely used for their faster speed. We want to investigate if optical decoding has further advantages to reaching future goals. We have investigated and compared the decoding latency and power consumption of an optical chip and its electronic counterpart built with MOSFETs. We have found that optical processing has a speed and power consumption benefit. For future networks and real-time applications, this can bring huge advantages over our current electronic processors.

    "abstract": "Standard cavity cooling of atoms or dielectric particles is based on the action of dispersive optical forces in high-finesse cavities. We investigate here a complementary regime characterized by large cavity losses, resembling the standard Doppler cooling technique. For a single two-level emitter a modification of the cooling rate is obtained from the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous emission in the large cooperativity limit. This mechanism is aimed at cooling of quantum emitters without closed transitions, which is the case for molecular systems, where the Purcell effect can mitigate the loss of population from the cooling cycle. We extend our analytical formulation to the many particle case governed by weak individual coupling but exhibiting collective strong Purcell enhancement to a cavity mode. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, we simulated the algorithmic performance of a small neutral atom quantum computer and compared its performance when operating with all-to-all versus nearest-neighbor connectivity. This comparison was made using a suite of algorithmic benchmarks developed by the Quantum Economic Development Consortium. Circuits were simulated with a noise model consistent with experimental data from Nature 604, 457 (2022). We find that all-to-all connectivity improves simulated circuit fidelity by $10\\%-15\\%$, compared to nearest-neighbor connectivity. ",
