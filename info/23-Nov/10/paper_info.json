    "abstract": "Anderson predicted that electrons diffused by a disordered potential in doped semiconductors see a metal-to-insulator transition of the material when the disorder is sufficiently high. In this manuscript we demonstrate an equivalent metal-to-insulator transition for nonlinear waves, namely Gap-Solitons, in disordered photonic crystal waveguides. Light localization is described by introducing a new metric able to track the wavepacket center of mass. By statistical averaging this quantity over many realizations of the disorder, we demonstrate that in linear regime the ensemble averaged barycenter matches the localization length lloc as defined in literature. Then, by applying our barycenter method, we prove that for Gap-Solitons the transition from localized to ballistic transport goes faster than the vg2 law ruling the linear regime. By overcoming this scaling law, improved robustness to disorder of nonlinear waves is demonstrated. ",

    "abstract": "Following the changes in molecular structure throughout the entirety of a chemical reaction with atomic resolution is a long-term goal in femtochemistry. Although the development of a plethora of ultrafast technique has enabled detailed investigations of the electronic and nuclear dynamics on femtosecond time scales, direct and unambiguous imaging of the nuclear motion during a reaction is still a major challenge. Here, we apply time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging with femtosecond near-infrared pulses to visualize the ultraviolet-induced ultrafast molecular dynamics of gas-phase furan. Widely contradicting predictions and observations for this molecule have been reported in the literature. By combining the experimental Coulomb explosion imaging data with ab initio molecular dynamics and Coulomb explosion simulations, we reveal the presence of a strong ultrafast ring-opening pathway upon excitation at 198 nm that occurs within 100 fs.

    "title": "High Performance Thin-film Lithium Niobate Modulator Applied ITO  Composite Electrode with Modulation Efficiency of 1V*cm",
    "abstract": "Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) based electro-optic modulator is widely applied in the field of broadband optical communications due to its advantages such as large bandwidth, high extinction ratio, and low optical loss, bringing new possibilities for the next generation of high-performance electro-optic modulators. However, the modulation efficiency of TFLN modulators is still relatively low when compared with Silicon and Indium-Phosphide (InP) based competitors. Due to the restriction of the trade-off between half-wave voltage and modulation length, it is difficult to simultaneously obtain low driving voltage and large modulating bandwidth. Here, we break this limitation by introducing Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) film, resulting in an ultra-high modulation efficiency of 1.02 V*cm in O-Band. The fabricated composite electrode not only achieves high modulation efficiency but also maintains a high electro-optic bandwidth, as demonstrated by the 3 dB roll-off at 108 GHz and the transmission of PAM-4 signals at 224 Gbit/s. Our device presents new solutions for the next generation of low-cost high-performance electro-optic modulators. Additionally, it paves the way for downsizing TFLN-based multi-channel optical transmitter chips. ",

In an objective-based total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-M), we propose to use the resulting large field enhancement supported in such coverslip to improve TIRF-M sensitivity by amplifying the collected fluorescence signal. We present here the optimization, realization and testing in TIRF-M of resonant coverslips designed to take into account the experimental constraints. The latter's are due to the inverted configuration of TIRF-M together with the use of a high numerical aperture objective. The challenge is therefore to find the best coating design compromising between the angular tolerance and the field enhancement. We will report here enhanced-TIRF-M imaging over model samples but the ultimate goal here is to be able to monitor and quantify dynamics of pathogens at the membrane of living cells. ",

However, it is not well understood how the oblique incidence of the laser pulse would affect the protons/ion spectra in the case of a micro-structured target. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show here that the protons/ions cut-off energies are rather reduced in the case of oblique incidence of the laser pulse if the target has a micron-sized groove on its front surface. This is also found to be true for a periodically grooved target. ",

Here we show that a high-dimensional optical fiber communication system can be entirely implemented by a reconfigurable integrated photonic processor, featuring kernels of multichannel mode multiplexing transmitter and all-optical descrambling receiver. High-speed and inter-chip communications involving six spatial- and polarization modes have been experimentally demonstrated with high efficiency and high-quality eye diagrams, despite the presence of random mode scrambling and polarization rotation in a circular-core few-mode fiber. The proposed photonic integration approach holds promising prospects for future space-division multiplexing applications. ",

In a second time, we meticulously explain each step involved in a $GW$ calculation and what type of physical quantities can be computed. To illustrate its versatility, we consider two contrasting systems: the water molecule, a weakly correlated system, and the carbon dimer, a strongly correlated system. Each stage of the process is thoroughly detailed and explained alongside numerical results and illustrative plots. We hope that the contribution will facilitate the dissemination and democratization of Green's function-based formalisms within the computational and theoretical quantum chemistry community. ",

We compare the current for copper, aluminium and Kapton targets at different laser energies. The data shows the stable production of current peaks and clear prospects for the tailoring of the pulse shape, promising for future applications in high energy density science, e.g. electromagnetic interference stress tests, high-voltage pulse response measurements, and charged particle beam lensing.

    "abstract": "Valley Hall photonic crystals (VPCs) offer the potential to create topological waveguides capable of guiding light through sharp bends on a chip. They can seamlessly integrate with functional components while occupying minimal space, making them a promising technology for terahertz (THz) topological photonic integrated circuits. However, a significant limitation for THz-scale integrated VPC-based devices has been the absence of arbitrary bend interconnects. Due to the crystalline symmetry, the traditional VPC designs restrict waveguides to the principal lattice axes (i.e., only 0-, 60- or 120- degree orientations). Here, we present an on-chip, all silicon implementation of deformed VPCs enabling topological waveguides with a variety of shapes and bends. Although the lattice is amorphous and lacks long-range periodicity, the topological protection of the waveguides is sustained by short-range order. We experimentally demonstrate the robust on-chip transmission of THz waves through waveguides of complicated shapes and arbitrary bends. We implement an amorphous lattice that serves as a frequency-dependent router capable of splitting the input signal into two perpendicular output ports, which cannot be achieved with an undeformed VPC. In addition, we showcase on-chip THz communication through 90 degree and P-shaped VPC waveguides, achieving data rates of 72 Gbit/s and 32 Gbit/s, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the amorphous topological photonic crystals significantly enhance the adaptability of on-chip interconnections while preserving the performance of the topological waveguides.

However, through contracting (or projecting) the eigenvalue equation, more efficient strategies can be designed for near-term quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that when combined with the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle for mixed quantum states, the ground-state contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE) can be generalized to compute any number of quantum eigenstates simultaneously. We introduce two excited-state (anti-Hermitian) CQEs that perform the excited-state calculation while inheriting many of the remarkable features of the original ground-state version of the algorithm, such as its scalability. To showcase our approach, we study several model and chemical Hamiltonians and investigate the performance of different implementations. ",

We find that this anomaly is strongly intensity dependent, and the ratio of the low-temperature photoresistance signals for the CR-active (CRA) and CR-inactive (CRI) polarities of magnetic field increases with lowering power, but, nevertheless, remains substantially lower than expected from conventional theory assuming interaction of the plane electromagnetic wave with the uniform 2DES. Our analysis shows that all data can be well described by the nonlinear CR-enhanced electron gas heating in both CRA and CRI regimes. This description, however, requires a source of anomalous absorption of radiation in the CRI regime. It can stem from evanescent electromagnetic fields originating from the near-field diffraction within or in the vicinity of the quantum well hosting the 2DES. ",

For the simulation of fermions, valid parameterizations must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of particles. Typically, antisymmetry is enforced by leveraging the anti-symmetry of determinants with respect to the exchange of matrix rows, but this involves computing a full determinant each time the wavefunction is evaluated. Instead, we introduce a new antisymmetrization layer derived from sorting, the $\\textit{sortlet}$, which scales as $O(N \\log N)$ with regards to the number of particles -- in contrast to $O(N^3)$ for the determinant. We show numerically that applying this anti-symmeterization layer on top of an attention based neural-network backbone yields a flexible wavefunction parameterization capable of reaching chemical accuracy when approximating the ground state of first-row atoms and small molecules.
