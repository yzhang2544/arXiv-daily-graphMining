    "title": "Quantum entanglement: proposal for a new kind of experiment",
    "abstract": "This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model which is based on a simple but decidedly unorthodox physical hypothesis: the nonlocally correlated outcomes of the wavefunction collapse of two entangled particles is driven by an exchange of information between them. Of course exchange of information between spacelike separated entities is forbidden in 3+1 space-time, thus we can wonder whether or not a way out could be found by invoking the existence of some hidden field propagating in an extra time dimension to make the mentioned exchange of information occurring at finite velocity through this extra dimension. Only the description of the wavefunction collapse would be affected by the existence of this extra-time dimension. The model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wavefunction collapse by means of nonlinear (non-unitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model so obtained is just speculative without any claim of being robust against any criticism, nevertheless, it satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be verified experimentally; in fact, it makes the proposal of an experiment potentially interesting which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful. ",

    "abstract": "Building on decades of fundamental research, new applications of Quantum Science have started to emerge in the fields of computing, sensing and networks. In the current phase of deployment, in which quantum technology is not yet in routine use but is still transitioning out of the laboratory, Venture Capital (VC) is critical. In association with public funding programs, VC supports startups born in academic institutions and has a role to play in structuring the priorities of the ecosystem, guiding it towards applications with the greatest impact on society. This paper illustrates this thesis with a case-study: the experience of the first dedicated quantum fund, Quantonation I, chronicling its impacts on the production of scientific knowledge, job creation and funding of the industry. The paper introduces concepts to support the emergence of new startups and advocates for funding of scale-up quantum companies. The paper concludes with proposals to improve the impact of the industry by taking steps to better involve society-at-large and with a call for collaboration on projects focused on the applications with a large societal benefit.

    "abstract": "We investigate the crosstalk between Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) pixels in a prototype 24-pixel hard X-ray array fabricated at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Analysis shows thermal cross talk, possibly associated with insufficient thermalization, and rare but large in magnitude electrical crosstalk between specific perpetrator-victim pixel combinations, potentially due to deficiencies in the bias wiring or microwave multiplexing circuit. We use a method based on group triggering and averaging to isolate the crosstalk response despite only having access to X-ray photon illumination uniform across the entire array. This allows us to identify thermal and electrical crosstalk between pixel pairs in repeated measurements to the level of 1 part in 1000 or better. In the array under study, the magnitude of observed crosstalk is small but comparable to the resolving power of this pixel design (E/$\\Delta$E $\\sim$ 1000 at 20 keV) and so potentially responsible for a degradation in energy resolution of the array at high incident photon rates. Having proven the methods to identify and quantify crosstalk in our setup, we can consider mitigations. ",

A situation is considered where a modulation is used to provide the so-called in-phase and quadrature signals in the optical field's transmission, which are used for stabilization of the local oscillator's frequency in chip-scale atomic clocks. In a general case, the frequencies of the signals nonlinearly depend on the optical field's intensity due to the asymmetry of the resonance. In this work, we demonstrate a) that this effect stems from a multi-peak structure of the resonance; b) a linear dependence of the frequency on the optical field's intensity at high modulation values; c) that the regime of the resolved structure has more advantages than suppression of the frequency shift due to the spectrum asymmetry.

We define the rate of construction as the percentage of groups collaborating on problem-solving that solve the problem correctly out of all groups having at least one member who answered correctly and one incorrectly while solving the same problem individually first. We define the rate of co-construction on each problem as the percentage of collaborating groups that answered it correctly if no student in the group individually answered it correctly before the collaborative work. In this study, we investigated student learning measured by student performance on a validated quantum mechanics survey and rates of construction and co-construction of knowledge when students first worked individually after lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts and then worked with peers during class without receiving any feedback from the course instructor. We find that construction of knowledge consistently occurred at a high rate during peer collaboration. However, rates of co-construction were more varied. High rates of co-construction were generally achieved when approximately half of the students knew the correct answers initially. We also conducted an analysis of some of the survey questions that correlate with high rates of co-construction to gain some insight into what students converged on after peer interaction and what types of difficulties were reduced. Our findings can be valuable for instructors who want to provide in-class and out-of-class opportunities for peer collaboration in their physics courses. ",

Despite the prevalence of different electromagnetic waves in space, there is still a lack of understanding of fundamental aspects of wave--particle interactions, particularly in terms of energy flow and velocity-space characteristics. In this study, we combine a novel quasilinear model with observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to reveal the signatures of resonant interactions between electrons and whistler waves in magnetic holes, which are coherent structures often found in the Earth's magnetosheath. We investigate the energy transfer rates and velocity-space characteristics associated with Landau and cyclotron resonances between electrons and slightly oblique propagating whistler waves. In the case of our observed magnetic hole, the loss of electron kinetic energy primarily contributes to the growth of whistler waves through the $n=-1$ cyclotron resonance, where $n$ is the order of the resonance expansion in linear Vlasov--Maxwell theory. The excitation of whistler waves leads to a reduction of the temperature anisotropy and parallel heating of the electrons. Our study offers a new and self-consistent understanding of resonant energy transfer in turbulent plasmas. ",

In this work, we demonstrate a novel real-time ratiometric fiber optic thermometry technique based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) diamond that shows the highest temperature resolution (22.91 KHz^(-1/2) Wcm^(-2)) and spatial resolution (~7.5 um) among all-optical fiber-based thermosensors reported to date. Instead of analyzing the spectral features of temperature-dependent SiV signal, coming from SiV micro-diamond fixed on the fiber tip, an alternative parallel detection method based on filtering optics and photon counters is proposed to read out the sample temperature in real-time. The signal collection efficiency of the fiber is also investigated numerically with semi-analytic ray-optical analysis and then compared with our experimental study. We finally demonstrate the performance of the thermosensor by monitoring the temperature at distinct locations in a lab-built graphite-based microheater device. Our work introduces a reconfigurable method for temperature monitoring in microelectronic, microfluidic devices, or biological environments and unlocks a new direction for fiber-based all-optical thermometry research.

Despite of remarkable progresses made, achieving spin-photon entanglement remains a crucial aspect to be realized. In this paper, we experimentally generate entanglement between a silicon vacancy defect in silicon carbide and a scattered single photon in the zero-phonon line. The spin state is measured by detecting photons scattered in the phonon sideband. The photonic qubit is encoded in the time-bin degree-of-freedom and measured using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Photonic correlations not only reveal the quality of the entanglement but also verify the deterministic nature of the entanglement creation process.

    "title": "Quantum trapping and rotational self-alignment in triangular Casimir  microcavities",
    "abstract": "Casimir torque -- a rotational motion caused by the minimization of the zero-point energy -- is a problem that attracts significant theoretical and experimental interest. Recently, it has been realized using liquid crystal phases and natural anisotropic substrates. However, for natural materials, the torque reaches substantial values only at van der Waals distances of ~10 nm. Here, we employ Casimir self-assembly using templated gold nanostructures of triangular symmetry for the purpose of rotational self-alignment at truly Casimir distances (100 -- 200 nm separation). The joint action of repulsive electrostatic and attractive Casimir potentials leads to the formation of a stable quantum trap, giving rise to a tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. This cavity self aligns both laterally and rotationally to maximize the overlap area between the templated and floating triangular flakes. The rotational self-alignment is remarkably sensitive to the equilibrium distance between the two triangles as well as their area, which opens possibilities for active control through manipulating the electrostatic screening. Our self-assembled and self-aligned Casimir microcavities could find future use as a versatile and tunable platform for nanophotonic, polaritonic, and optomechanical applications. ",

    "title": "Autoencoder-based analytic continuation method for strongly correlated  quantum systems",
    "abstract": "The single particle Green's function provides valuable information on the momentum and energy-resolved spectral properties for a strongly correlated system. In large-scale numerical calculations using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), including cluster-DMFT, one usually obtains the Green's function in imaginary-time $G(\\tau)$. The process of inverting a Laplace transform to obtain the spectral function $A(\\omega)$ in real-frequency is an ill-posed problem and forms the core of the analytic continuation problem. In this Letter, we propose to use a completely unsupervised autoencoder-type neural network to solve the analytic continuation problem. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach that, together with only minor physical assumptions, can extract a high-quality frequency response from the imaginary time domain. With a deeply tunable architecture, this method can, in principle, locate sharp features of spectral functions that might normally be lost using already well-established methods, such as maximum entropy (MaxEnt) methods. We demonstrate the strength of the autoencoder approach by applying it to QMC results of $G(\\tau)$ for a single-band Hubbard model. The proposed method is general and can also be applied to other ill-posed inverse problems. ",
