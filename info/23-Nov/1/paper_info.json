    "abstract": "The combination of surface coils and metamaterials remarkably enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance for significant local staging flexibility. However, due to the coupling in between, impeded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low-contrast resolution, further hamper the future growth in clinical MRI. In this paper, we propose a high-Q metasurface decoupling isolator fueled by topological LC loops for 1.5T surface coil MRI system, increasing the magnetic field up to fivefold at 63.8 MHz. We have employed a polarization conversion mechanism to effectively eliminate the coupling between the MRI metamaterial and the radio frequency (RF) surface transmitter-receiver coils. Furthermore, a high-Q metasurface isolator was achieved by taking advantage of bound states in the continuum (BIC) for extremely high-field MRI and spectroscopy. An equivalent physical model of the miniaturized metasurface design was put forward through LC circuit analysis. This study opens up a promising route for the easy-to-use and portable surface coil MRI scanners. ",

    "title": "Light focusing and additive manufacturing through highly scattering  media using upconversion nanoparticles",
    "abstract": "Light-based additive manufacturing holds great potential in the field of bioprinting due to its exceptional spatial resolution, enabling the reconstruction of intricate tissue structures. However, printing through biological tissues is severely limited due to the strong optical scattering within the tissues. The propagation of light is scrambled to form random speckle patterns, making it impossible to print features at the diffraction-limited size with conventional printing approaches. The poor tissue penetration depth of ultra-violet or blue light, which is commonly used to trigger photopolymerization, further limits the fabrication of high cell-density tissue constructs. Recently, several strategies based on wavefront shaping have been developed to manipulate the light and refocus it inside scattering media to a diffraction-limited spot. In this study, we present a high-resolution additive manufacturing technique using upconversion nanoparticles and a wavefront shaping method that does not require measurement from an invasive detector, i.e., it is a non-invasive technique. Upconversion nanoparticles convert near-infrared light to ultraviolet and visible light. The ultraviolet light serves as a light source for photopolymerization and the visible light as a guide star for digital light shaping. The incident light pattern is manipulated using the feedback information of the guide star to focus light through the tissue. In this way, we experimentally demonstrate that near-infrared light can be non-invasively focused through a strongly scattering medium. By exploiting the optical memory effect, we further demonstrate micro-meter resolution additive manufacturing through highly scattering media such as a 300-{\\mu}m-thick chicken breast. This study provides a proof of concept of high-resolution additive manufacturing through turbid media with potential application in tissue engineering. ",

    "title": "Flexible metasurface for improving brain imaging at 7T",
    "abstract": "Ultra-high field MRI offers unprecedented detail for non-invasive visualization of the human brain. However, brain imaging is challenging at 7T due to the B$_1^+$ field inhomogeneity, which results in signal intensity drops in temporal lobes and a bright region in the brain center. This study aims to evaluate using a metasurface to improve brain imaging at 7T and simplify the investigative workflow. Two flexible metasurfaces, each comprising a periodic structure of copper strips and parallel-plate capacitive elements printed on an ultra-thin substrate, were optimized for brain imaging and implemented via PCB. We considered two setups: (1) two metasurfaces located near the temporal lobes; and (2) one metasurface placed near the occipital lobe The effect of metasurface placement on the transmit efficiency and specific absorption rate was evaluated via electromagnetic simulation studies with voxelized models. In addition, their impact on SNR and diagnostic image quality was evaluated in vivo for male and female volunteers. Placement of metasurfaces near the regions of interest led to an increase in homogeneity of the transmit field by 5$\\%$ and 10.5$\\%$ in the right temporal lobe and occipital lobe for a male subject, respectively. SAR values changed insignificantly and were under recommended limits. In vivo studies also confirmed the numerically predicted improvement in field distribution and receive sensitivity in the desired ROI. Optimized metasurfaces enable homogenizing transmit field distribution in the brain at 7T. The proposed lightweight and flexible structure has the potential to provide MR examination with higher diagnostic value images. ",

    "title": "Efficient formulation of multitime generalized quantum master equations:  Taming the cost of simulating 2D spectra",
    "abstract": "Modern 4-wave mixing spectroscopies are expensive to obtain experimentally and computationally. In certain cases, the unfavorable scaling of quantum dynamics problems can be improved using a generalized quantum master equation (GQME) approach. However, the inclusion of multiple (light-matter) interactions complicates the equation of motion and leads to seemingly unavoidable cubic scaling in time. In this paper, we present a formulation that greatly simplifies and reduces the computational cost of previous work that extended the GQME framework to treat arbitrary numbers of quantum measurements. Specifically, we remove the time derivatives of quantum correlation functions from the modified Mori-Nakajima-Zwanzig framework by switching to a discrete-convolution implementation inspired by the transfer-tensor approach. We then demonstrate the method's capabilities by simulating 2D electronic spectra for the excitation-energy-transfer dimer model. In our method, the resolution of the data can be arbitrarily coarsened, especially along the $t_2$ axis, which mirrors how the data are obtained experimentally. Even in a modest case, this demands $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ fewer data points. We are further able to decompose the spectra into 1-, 2-, and 3-time correlations, showing how and when the system enters a Markovian regime where further measurements are unnecessary to predict future spectra and the scaling becomes quadratic. This offers the ability to generate long-time spectra using only short-time data, enabling access to timescales previously beyond the reach of standard methodologies. ",

    "abstract": "Optical frequency comb underpins a wide range of applications from communication, metrology, to sensing. Its development on a chip-scale platform -- so called soliton microcomb -- provides a promising path towards system miniaturization and functionality integration via photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology. Although extensively explored in recent years, challenges remain in key aspects of microcomb such as complex soliton initialization, high threshold, low power efficiency, and limited comb reconfigurability. Here we present an on-chip laser that directly outputs microcomb and resolves all these challenges, with a distinctive mechanism created from synergetic interaction among resonant electro-optic effect, optical Kerr effect, and optical gain inside the laser cavity. Realized with integration between a III-V gain chip and a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) PIC, the laser is able to directly emit mode-locked microcomb on demand with robust turnkey operation inherently built in, with individual comb linewidth down to 600 Hz, whole-comb frequency tuning rate exceeding $\\rm 2.4\\times10^{17}$ Hz/s, and 100% utilization of optical power fully contributing to comb generation. The demonstrated approach unifies architecture and operation simplicity, high-speed reconfigurability, and multifunctional capability enabled by TFLN PIC, opening up a great avenue towards on-demand generation of mode-locked microcomb that is expected to have profound impact on broad applications.

The detection current has a peak at the bias voltage at the boundary between (ii) and (iii). Effect of frequency fluctuation of irradiated wave is analyzed for (iii), and it is shown that the detection current is proportional to irradiated power if the fluctuation becomes wider than injection-locking range.

This work presents an experimental study of collective radiative processes on a photonic kagome lattice. A single or simultaneous -- in or out-of-phase -- excitation of the outlying sites controls the radiation dynamics.

We calculate the total radiated energy per electron and the spectral distribution of different radiation orders, taking into account material dispersion and absorption. For an optimized silica grating of 200 micrometer length, the total radiated energy reaches 2~eV per electron for 2 MeV electrons. Above the Cherenkov threshold, in most cases the energy of Cherenkov diffraction radiation is several times higher than the energy of internal Smith-Purcell radiation, but for some geometries and frequency ranges first or second order radiation may dominate over Cherenkov radiation (zeroth order). Radiation up to the 4th order is detected in the simulation. The spectrum of Cherenkov radiation is highly resonant, with local minima for frequencies where maxima of the other radiation orders occur. The spectrum of Cherenkov radiation takes a frequency comb-like shape for a uniform layer of Si on SiO2 substrate, due to a Fabry-Perot effect occurring for the evanescent field of the moving electron. The proposed setup could become a prototype of a non-invasive particle beam monitor for both conventional and laser particle accelerators. ",

Group III- nitrides have previously been shown to host efficient SPEs which are attributed to deep energy levels within the large bandgap of the material, in a way that is similar to extensively investigated colour centres in diamond. Anti-bunched emission from defect centres within gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminium nitride (AlN) have been recently demonstrated. While such emitters are particularly interesting due to the compatibility of III-nitrides with cleanroom processes, the nature of such defects and the optimal conditions for forming them are not fully understood. Here, we investigate Al implantation on a commercial AlN epilayer through subsequent steps of thermal annealing and confocal microscopy measurements. We observe a fluence-dependent increase in the density of the emitters, resulting in creation of ensembles at the maximum implantation fluence. Annealing at 600 {\\deg}C results in the optimal yield in SPEs formation at the maximum fluence, while a significant reduction in SPE density is observed at lower fluences. These findings suggest that the mechanism of vacancy formation plays a key role in the creation of the emitters, and open new perspectives in the defect engineering of SPEs in solid state. ",

Recently, a series of atomic defects have been identified in the silicon platform, where scalable device integration can be enabled by mature silicon photonics and electronics technologies. In particular, T centers hold great promise due to their telecom band optical transitions and the doublet ground state electronic spin manifold with long coherence times. However, an open challenge for advancing the T center platform is to enhance its weak and slow zero phonon line emission. In this work, we demonstrate the cavity-enhanced fluorescence emission from a single T center. This is realized by integrating single T centers with a low-loss, small mode-volume silicon photonic crystal cavity, which results in an enhancement of the fluorescence decay rate by a factor of $F$ = 6.89. Efficient photon extraction enables the system to achieve an average photon outcoupling rate of 73.3 kHz at the zero phonon line. The dynamics of the coupled system is well modeled by solving the Lindblad master equation. These results represent a significant step towards building efficient T center spin-photon interfaces for quantum information processing and networking applications. ",

Applicable to the practical implementation, specific properties, i.e., long storage time, selective efficient coupling with other systems, and a high memory efficiency are desirable. Though many quantum memory systems have been developed thus far, none of them can perfectly meet all requirements. This work herein proposes a quantum memory based on color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), where its performance is evaluated based on a simple theoretical model of suitable defects in a cavity. Employing density functional theory calculations, 257 triplet and 211 singlet spin electronic transitions have been investigated. Among these defects, we found that some defects inherit the $\\Lambda$ electronic structures desirable for a Raman-type quantum memory and optical transitions can couple with other quantum systems. Further, the required quality factor and bandwidth are examined for each defect to achieve a 95\\% writing efficiency. Both parameters are influenced by the radiative transition rate in the defect state. In addition, inheriting triplet-singlet spin multiplicity indicates the possibility of being a quantum sensing, in particular, optically detected magnetic resonance. This work therefore demonstrates the potential usage of hBN defects as a quantum memory in future quantum networks. ",
