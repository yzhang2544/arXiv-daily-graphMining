    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and implementation of multi-trap optical tweezers based on new quadrifocal kinoform lenses. The phase distribution of these diffractive lenses is characterized by the Silver Mean sequence. The focusing properties of the resulting aperiodic DOEs coined Kinoform Silver Mean Lenses (KSMLs) are numerically examined. It is shown that, under monochromatic illumination, a KSML drives most of the incoming light into four single foci whose focal lengths are related to the Silver ratio. In this way, a KSML improves the diffraction efficiency of binary Fresnel Silver Mean Zone Plates. Through experimental results, the simultaneous trapping of particles in the four focal planes and their three-dimensional manipulation is demonstrated. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum communication has been at the forefront of modern research for decades, however it is severely hampered in underwater applications, where the properties of water absorb nearly all useful optical wavelengths and prevent them from propagating more than, in most cases, a few metres. This research reports on-demand quantum light sources, suitable for underwater optical communication. The single photon emitters, which can be engineered using an electron beam, are based on impurities in hexagonal boron nitride. They have a zero phonon line at ~ 436 nm, near the minimum value of water absorption and are shown to suffer negligible transmission and purity loss when travelling through water channels. These emitters are also shown to possess exceptional underwater transmission properties compared to emitters at other optical wavelengths and are utilised in a proof of principle underwater communication link with rates of several kbits/s.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal bunch lengthening via higher harmonic cavities is essential for the new state-of-the-art 4th generation of synchrotron light storage rings, as it can effectively improve the Touschek lifetime and mitigate the transverse emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering. In general, the optimum or near-optimum bunch lengthening condition is widely adopted for the double radio-frequency system. This paper reveals, under this optimum lengthening condition, that the short-range effect of resonant modes of the main and harmonic cavities has the potential to enhance or suppress the bunch lengthening significantly. Using the planned Hefei Advanced Light Facility storage ring as an example, it is particularly demonstrated that the short-range effects of the main and harmonic fundamental modes can dramatically degrade the bunch lengthening for the assumed case of high-charge bunches. This degradation of bunch lengthening is again presented with a realistic example of PETRA-IV that operated in timing mode with high bunch charge. It is found that there exists a setting of harmonic voltage and phase quite different from the conventional optimum lengthening setting, to get optimum bunch lengthening. ",

In the strong coupling regime, excitons and cavity photons form new states named exciton-polaritons, with their properties a hybrid of each constituent. Herein, we report strong coupling observed in solution-processed donor:acceptor bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) evidenced by the observed Rabi splitting of ~300 meV and the effects of strong coupling on OSC operations. Combining the transient photovoltage decay measurement and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, our results reveal that the effective charge carrier lifetimes are longer in cavity devices, attributed to the reduced bimolecular recombination. It is also found that access to CT state(s) of higher energy is enabled in cavity devices. This study demonstrates that strong coupling can effectively modify the device- and photo-physics in OSCs and opens a new pathway for engineering more efficient OSCs. ",

The essential rules for how terahertz light interacts with these systems in a nonlinear way are still not understood. In this work, we demonstrate a universally applicable electronic nonlinearity originating from spin-orbit interactions in conducting materials, wherein the interplay of light-induced spin and orbital textures manifests. We utilized terahertz harmonic generation spectroscopy to investigate the nonlinear dynamics over picosecond timescales in various transition metal films. We found that the terahertz harmonic generation efficiency scales with the spin Hall conductivity in the studied films, while the phase takes two possible values (shifted by {\\pi}), depending on the d-shell filling. These findings elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing non-equilibrium spin and orbital polarization dynamics at terahertz frequencies, which is relevant for potential applications of terahertz spin- and orbital-based devices.

    "title": "Towards a general description of the cavitation threshold in acoustic  systems",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, the occurrence of cavitation has been related to the ratio between flow velocity and pressure gradient in the case of hydrodynamic cavitation, or some combination of vapor pressure and surface tension. However, both formulations present a large discrepancy with experimental data for cases in which cavitation is induced by acoustic waves. The present study aims to identify a more suitable cavitation threshold for such cases. The methodology adopted in this work consists of a combination of visualization with high-speed cameras and direct measurements using a hydrophone. The data collected confirmed that the vapor pressure is not a proper indicator of cavitation occurrence for an acoustic system characterized by high frequencies. The main reason behind the inability of vapor pressure to predict incipient cavitation in acoustic systems is that they evolve very quickly toward strong gradients in pressure, and the quasi-static assumptions used by traditional models are not valid. Instead, the system evolves towards a metastable state [Brennen, 2013], where the liquid exhibits an elastic behavior and can withstand negative pressures. A new cavitation number accounting for the tensile strength of the liquid was defined. An acoustic analogy is also proposed for the description, with the same framework, of an impulsive cavitation phenomenon. ",

Here we present an analysis and comparison of four different setups in which highly reflecting membranes can be employed for cavity optomechanics, and discuss optimal choices w.r.t. the figures of merit cooperativity and efficiency-weighted cooperativity. The analysis encompasses three different types of membrane-in-the-middle setups (membrane-at-the-edge, membrane-in-the-actual-middle, and membrane-at-the-back), as well as the simple Fabry-Perot cavity. Interestingly, we identify and propose the membrane-at-the-back setup as an optimal choice in the limit of negligible membrane parasitic loss, which can reach enormous enhancements of optomechanical cooperativity, and if implemented with a low-loss membrane would pave the way to nonlinear optomechanics in the quantum regime.

Free-space QKD allows for this information to be sent over great distances and in places where fibre-based communications cannot be implemented, such as ground-satellite. The primary limiting factor for free-space links is the effect of atmospheric turbulence, which can result in significant error rates and increased losses in QKD channels. Here, we employ the use of a high-speed Adaptive Optics (AO) system to make real-time corrections to the wavefront distortions on spatial modes that are used for high-dimensional QKD in our turbulent channel. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the AO system in improving the coupling efficiency of a Gaussian mode that has propagated through turbulence. Through process tomography, we show that our system is capable of significantly reducing the crosstalk of spatial modes in the channel. Finally, we show that employing AO reduces the quantum dit error rate for a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum-based QKD protocol, allowing for secure communication in a channel where it would otherwise be impossible. These results are promising for establishing long-distance free-space QKD systems. ",

    "abstract": "The spin-to-charge current interconversion in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers with strong spin-orbit coupling has garnered considerable attention due to its exceptional potential in advancing spintronics devices for data storage and logic applications. Platinum (Pt) stands out as one of the most effective materials for generating spin current. While the spin conversion efficiency is isotropic in polycrystalline Pt samples, an ongoing debate persists regarding its dependence on the crystalline direction in single crystalline samples. In this study, we aim to comprehensively evaluate the in-plane anisotropy of spin-charge interconversion using an array of complementary Spin Hall and inverse Spin Hall techniques with both incoherent and coherent excitation. Specifically, we investigate the spin-to-charge interconversion in epitaxial, (111)-oriented, Co/Pt bilayers with low surface roughness, as resulted from x-ray experiments. By varying the thickness of the Pt layer, we gain insights into the spin-charge interconversion in epitaxial Pt and highlight the effects of the interfaces. Our results demonstrate an isotropic behavior within the limits of our detection uncertainty. This finding significantly enhances our understanding of spin conversion in one of the most relevant systems in spintronics and paves the way for future research in this field. ",

The effects of optical absorption and scattering properties of coating materials on the temperatures and heat fluxes through coatings are explored using a two-flux heat transfer model, and promising combinations are identified that reduce the coating-alloy interface temperatures. Lower interface temperatures occur for thickness normalized absorptions of $\\overline{\\kappa} L$ $>$1. The effect of both a narrow and a broad band spectrally selective absorbing Gd${_2}$Zr${_2}$O$_{7}$ based coating materials are then studied. These show that large values of the product of the normalized absorption length and the spectral width of the absorption are required to significantly decrease the radiative heat transport through a coating. The results emphasize the importance of enhancing the optical absorption of the next generation barrier materials as a strategy to increase gas turbine engine efficiency by decreasing compressor bleed air cooling requirements.
