    "abstract": "An Adaptive Spiral Phase Plate (ASPP) based on liquid crystal (LC) and the transmission electrode technique is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. This ASPP design enables the generation of high-quality optical vortices with topological charges ranging from $\\pm1$ to $\\pm4$ using a single device (but using a higher birefringence LC and thickness this number can be multiplied by four). The continuous reconfigurability of the optical phase shift, achieved through a simple control mechanism involving only two low voltages, sets this device apart as the most accurate approximation to an ideal ASPP proposed to date. This device offers remarkable advantages, such as complete reconfigurability, allowing adjustment of operating wavelengths and topological charges. The fabrication process mirrors that of a standard LCD cell, ensuring a cost-effective and reliable solution. Its versatile applications, including fiber optics communications and atom manipulation, promise reduced fabrication costs for existing devices and the generation of diverse Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) modes. In summary, the proposed ASPP stands as a pivotal advancement, providing superior light efficiency, simplicity, and the capability for on-the-fly reconfiguration in a variety of optical applications.

A semiconductor laser based on Nd:YAG operating at its 4th harmonic wavelength, lambda = 266 nm with varying laser fluence and spot size of about 5 um is irradiated on the NiO film. The localized heating allows for smoothening of the NiO film along with contributions to the changes in the stoichiometry of NiO (reduction of excess oxygen). In particular, the effects of tuning laser fluence and the subsequent tribology tests pertaining to the coefficient of friction variations for tribological tests are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present the design of a photonic crystal (PC) structure with a hexagonal lattice, where adjustments to the PC unit cell symmetry reveal an all-angle self-collimation (SC) effect. By optimizing opto-geometric parameters, such as the rotational angle of auxiliary rods and adjacent distances, we analyze the SC property in detail, leveraging group velocity dispersion (GVD) and third-order dispersion (TOD) characteristics. We also investigate the relationship between symmetry properties and their influence on dispersion characteristics. Through symmetry manipulation, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing light collimation and confinement in the proposed configurations. The PC structure with a $C_1$ symmetry group exhibits all-angle SC effect within the range of $a/\\lambda=0.652$ and $a/\\lambda=0.668$ normalized frequencies, with a bandwidth of $\\Delta \\omega/\\omega_c = 2.4\\%$. Further breaking the symmetry, transforming from $C_1$ to $C_2$ group symmetry, enhances the SC bandwidth to $\\Delta \\omega/\\omega_c =6.5\\%$ and reveals the perfect linear equi-frequency contours (EFC) at two different frequency bands: all angle SC between $a/\\lambda = 0.616$ and $a/\\lambda = 0.656$ normalized frequencies in the 4th transverse magnetic (TM) band and between $a/\\lambda=0.712$ and $a/\\lambda=0.760$ in the 5th TM band. Additionally, we propose a composite/hybrid PC structure resembling $C_2$ group symmetry, where two auxiliary rods are replaced by rectangular photonic wires with the same refractive index and width equal to the diameter of auxiliary rods. This hybrid structure exhibits an all-angle SC effect with an operating bandwidth of $\\Delta \\omega/\\omega_c =11.7\\%$, displays near-zero GVD and TOD performance and offers enhanced robustness against potential fabrication precision issues.

Two options are compared, (i) an electro-optic modulator (EOM), and (ii) the direct modulation of the laser current. The 1.55~$\\mu$m laser and the detector are the same. The effect of experimental parameters is investigated, the main of which are the microwave power and the laser bias current. The main result is that the upper bound of the phase flicker is $-117$~dBrad$^2$ in the case of the EOM, limited by the background noise of the setup. In contrast, with direct modulation of the laser, the flicker is of $-114$ to $-100$~dBrad$^2$, depending on the laser bias current (50--90~mA), and the highest noise occurs at the lowest bias.

    "abstract": "Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are excellent luminescent nanomaterials for a broad range of optoelectronic applications. Their photoluminescence blinking, however, hinders their practical use in many aspects. It has been shown that coupling QDs to plasmonic nanostructures may provide a viable way to suppress blinking. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of blinking suppression remains unclear and debated. Here, by deterministically coupling a single QD to a plasmonic nanocavity, we clarify the mechanism of blinking suppression, and demonstrate unprecedentedly bright emission from a single colloidal QD. In particular, we report for the first time that the coupled system exhibits nonblinking photoluminescence with blinking lifetime, which shows that the elimination of photoluminescence blinking originates from enhanced quantum yield of the charged states. We identify that the radiative decay rate is boosted from (48 ns)-1 to (0.7 ns)-1, which outcompetes Auger processes and enables similar quantum yields for charged and neutral excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate ultrabright photoluminescence of up to 17 million detected photons per second from a single QD. This work sheds new light on the goal of achieving ultrabright nonblinking QDs and may benefit a variety of QD-based applications. ",

The use of high reflectivity multi-band coatings allows the frequency locking of several lasers of different wavelengths to a single cavity.

In our work, we stabilise the frequency of a $729\\,$nm and a $1069\\,$nm laser to one mirror pair and determine the residual-amplitude modulation (RAM) and photo-thermal noise (PTN). We find correlations in PTN between the two lasers and observe coherent cancellation of PTN for the $1069\\,$nm coating. We show that the fractional frequency instability of the $729\\,$nm laser is limited by RAM at $1\\times10^{-14}$.

Particle motion such as absorption and desorption at the wall was observed. The displacement probability distribution deviated from the Gaussian distribution at the tail, indicating non-Gaussian motion of the particles. Moreover, an analysis of the relative angle between three consecutive particle positions revealed that the probability of the particle moving backward was approximately twice that of the particle moving forward.

A key signature of their active biomechanics is the out-of-equilibrium fluctuation of the plasma membrane, also known as flickering motion. This active flickering is driven by motor proteins that connect the forces between the spectrin skeleton and the lipid bilayer. However, studying flickering motions in living red blood cells is challenging without altering their physical properties. Here, we implemented a holographic optical tweezer that sculpted a laser beam to create a force field distributed directly along the membrane equatorial contour. We show heterogeneous membrane flickering activity driven by membrane kickers in free-standing cells. Then we inhibited the active kickers by optical forces under minimal invasion, thus benchmarking the active motion against thermal fluctuations. Our work paves the way for optical control of biophysical forces, providing touchless strategies for mechanotransduction in living cells. ",

While electrostatic gating is simple and has been ubiquitously employed on 2DM, being able to tailor the interfacial properties in a similar real-time manner represents the next leap in our ability to modulate the underlying physics and build exotic devices with 2DM. However, all existing approaches rely on external machinery such as scanning microscopes, which often limit their scope of applications, and there is currently no means of tuning a 2D interface that has the same accessibility and scalability as electrostatic gating. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip platform designed for 2D materials with in situ tunable interfacial properties, utilizing a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). Each compact, cost-effective, and versatile device is a standalone micromachine that allows voltage-controlled approaching, twisting, and pressurizing of 2DM with high accuracy. As a demonstration, we engineer synthetic topological singularities, known as merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), via simultaneous control of twist angle and interlayer separation. The chirality of the resulting moire pattern further induces a strong circular dichroism in the second-harmonic generation. A potential application of this topological nonlinear susceptibility is to create integrated classical and quantum light sources that have widely and real-time tunable polarization. Our invention pushes the boundary of available technologies for manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials, which in turn opens up the gateway for designing future hybrid 2D-3D devices for condensed-matter physics, quantum optics, and beyond.
