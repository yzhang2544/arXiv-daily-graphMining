    "title": "Atomic Defect-Aware Physical Design of Silicon Dangling Bond Logic on  the H-Si(100)2x1 Surface",
    "abstract": "Although fabrication capabilities of Silicon Dangling Bonds have rapidly advanced from manual labor-driven laboratory work to automated manufacturing in just recent years, sub-nanometer substrate defects still pose a hindrance to production due to the need for atomic precision. In essence, unpassivated or missing surface atoms, contaminants, and structural deformations disturb the fabricated logic or prevent its realization altogether. Moreover, design automation techniques in this domain have not yet adopted any defect-aware behavior to circumvent the present obstacles. In this paper, we derive a surface defect model for design automation from experimentally verified defect types that we apply to identify sensitivities in an established gate library in an effort to generate more robust designs. Furthermore, we present an automatic placement and routing algorithm that considers scanning tunneling microscope data obtained from physical experiments to lay out dot-accurate circuitry that is resilient against the presence of atomic surface defects. This culminates in a holistic evaluation on surface data of varying defect rates that enables us to quantify the severity of such defects. We project that fabrication capabilities must achieve defect rates of around 0.1 %, if charged defects can be completely eliminated, or < 0.1 %, otherwise. This realization sets the pace for future efforts to scale up this promising circuit technology. ",

The fabricability of these designs, with segmentations in both the longitudinal and transverse dimensions, hinges on the minimum feature size offered by cutting-edge fabrication technologies. In this work we present both numerical and experimental evidence that high performance devices can be obtained while using large transverse segmentation periods of up to 650 nm, thereby increasing the critical feature sizes. For single-step etched couplers produced on the 220 nm silicon-on-insulator platform, we demonstrate coupling efficiencies of nearly 50% in the C-band and remarkably low back reflections of -22 dB at zero-degree incidence angle. Notably, the duty cycles used in our optimized designs deviate significantly from those predicted by traditional effective medium models, even for small periods. Our findings promise to expand the range of optical properties achievable in metamaterials and offer fresh insights into the fine-tuning of nanophotonic devices. ",

Highly absorbing and plasmonic particles garner considerable interest due to their enhanced optical interactions, yet traditional linear theory fails to predict their trapping behavior, particularly in the longitudinal direction. We introduce a more comprehensive theory that incorporates four-wave mixing and two-photon absorption, addressing significant gaps in the current literature. Our research shows TPA to be crucial for longitudinal trapping stability. Furthermore, our findings propose a novel phenomenon of multiple split traps in both saturable absorption and reverse saturable absorption regimes. Our framework extends beyond existing models by including factors such as self-induced back-action and scattering forces, aligning theoretical predictions with experimental observations, and laying a robust foundation for future nonlinear optical trapping and manipulation research.

Our results demonstrate third harmonic generation at an efficiency of up to $3.25\\times10^{-5}$, high quality wavefront shaping as illustrated by a third harmonic metalens, and a flatband, angle independent, third harmonic response up to $\\pm11^{\\circ}$ incident angle.

    "abstract": "The terahertz spectral region, which bridges between electronics and optics, is poised to play an important role in the development of transformative wireless communication and imaging systems with unprecedented functionality. Currently, a major challenge in terahertz technology is to develop high-performance terahertz beam-forming devices that can dynamically shape the terahertz radiation in a flexible manner. Existing terahertz beam-forming devices have limited coding bits, field-of-view, and beam gain. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable liquid crystal-integrated terahertz metasurface, with each metasurface unit cell being independently addressable. The metasurface has a 260{\\deg} continuous phase tuning range with a device thickness of only 1% of the free-space wavelength. We show that the terahertz wave diffracted from the metasurface can be steered towards a wide range of directions, covering a record-large 110{\\deg} field-of-view with a peak gain of 25 dBi. The metasurface also features a low power consumption and sub-second switching time. Furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of multiple terahertz beams, with the direction of each beam and the power ratio between beams adjustable on demand. The proposed liquid crystal metasurface possesses compelling prospects for future terahertz communication and imaging applications. ",

    "abstract": "This study examines the interplay between acoustic pressure oscillations and interactions between regions of intense vorticity in the reactive field of a turbulent combustor. These regions of intense vortical interactions are identified as vortical communities in the network space of weighted directed vortical networks constructed from two-dimensional velocity data. The vortical interactions in the high-dimensional reactive flow are condensed into a low-dimensional network representation by leveraging the inter-community strengths and the weighted community centroids. Subsequently, we show that the mean and the maximum of all inter-community interactions exhibit a strong delayed correlation with the acoustic pressure oscillations during the state of thermoacoustic instability. In contrast, during the state of combustion noise, the correlation between the acoustic pressure oscillations and the inter-community interactions is lost due to the incoherent spatiotemporal behaviour of acoustic and hydrodynamic fields in turbulent thermoacoustic system. Spatiotemporal evolution of pairs of vortical communities with the maximum inter-community interactions provides insight into explaining the critical regions detected in the reaction field during the states of intermittency and thermoacoustic instability in previous studies. We further demonstrate that the high correlations between network measures and acoustic pressure oscillations during the state of thermoacoustic instability weaken when steady air jets are introduced within the critical region to suppress the thermoacoustic oscillations. This work sheds light on the intricate relationship between the vortical interactions and the acoustic behaviour in a turbulent combustor, thus offering insights for understanding thermoacoustic instabilities in combustion systems and for unsteady flows in general fluid dynamics literature.

    "abstract": "Continuous tuning of the frequency of laser light is the cornerstone for a plethora of applications in basic science as well as in the industrial environment. They range from the hunt for gravitational waves, the realization of optical clocks over health and environmental monitoring to distance measurements. So far, it is difficult to combine a wide tuning range (> 100 GHz) with sub-microsecond tuning times, intrinsic tuning linearity and coherence lengths beyond 10 m. We show that electro-optically driven adiabatic frequency converters using high Q microresonators made of lithium niobate are able to transfer arbitrary voltage signals into frequency chirps on time scales far below 1 {\\mu}s. The temporal variation of the frequency nicely agrees with the one of the voltage applied. Superimposing the converted light with the unconverted one, we derived from the beat signal that 200-ns-long linear frequency chirps deviate less than 1 % from perfectness without any additional measures. The Coefficient of Determination is R2 > 0.999. The coherence length of the emitted light is of the order of 100 m. In order to prove these findings, we apply linear frequency sweeps for FMCW LiDAR for distances between 0.5 and 10 m without any signs of nonlinearity. Combined with the demonstrated ns tuning, with the potential to tune the eigenfrequency of lithiumniobate-based resonators by several 100 GHz, our results show that electro-optically driven adiabatic frequency converters can be used in applications that require ultrafast and flexible continuous frequency tuning with intrinsic linearity and large coherence length.

The mainstream methods of generating acoustic vortex are based on Huygens-Fresnel principle to modulate the wavefront to create spatial spiral phase dislocation. In this work, we propose an entirely new scenario to generate acoustic vortex in a waveguide with gradient sawtooth metasurface. The physical mechanism of our method is to lift the degenerate dipole eigenmodes through the scattering effect of the chiral surface structure, and then the superposition of them will generate both and order vortices in place. Compared to the existing methods of acoustic vortex production, our design has many merits, such as easy to manufacture and control, the working frequency is broadband, sign of vortex order can be readily flipped. Both the full-wave simulations and experimental measurements validate the existence of the acoustic vortices. The torque effect of the acoustic vortices is also successfully performed by rotating a foam disk as a practical application. Our work opens up a new route for generating acoustic vortex and could have potential significances in microfluidics, acoustic tweezers and ultrasonic communication, etc. ",

We investigate two different graphene dispersions via Raman spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy and observe no degradation of the material properties by the structuring process. Furthermore, we achieve high uniformity of the structured patterns and homogeneous graphene flake distribution.

We report here a global, thorough characterization of the neutron fields produced at the Apollon laser facility using the secondary laser beam (F2). A Double Plasma Mirror (DPM) was used to improve the temporal contrast of the laser which delivers pulses of 24 fs duration, a mean on-target energy of ~10 J and up to 1 shot/min. The interaction of the laser with thin targets (few tens or hundreds of nm) in ultra-high conditions produced enhanced proton beams (up to 35 MeV), which were then used to generate neutrons via the pitcher-catcher technique. The characterization of these neutron emissions is presented, with results obtained from both simulations and measurements using several diagnostics (activation samples, bubble detectors and Time-of-Flight detectors), leading to a neutron yield of ~4.10^7 neutrons/shot. Similar neutron emissions were observed during shots with and without DPM, while fewer X-rays are produced when the DPM is used, making this tool interesting to adjust the neutrons/X-rays ratio for some applications like combined neutron/X-ray radiography.

The frequency noise of KIDs is typically limited by tunneling Two-Level Systems (TLS), which originate from lattice defects in the dielectric materials required for PPCs. How the frequency noise level depends on the PPC's dimensions has not been experimentally addressed. We measure the frequency noise of 56 resonators with a-SiC:H PPCs, which cover a factor 44 in PPC area and a factor 4 in dielectric thickness. To support the noise analysis, we measure the TLS-induced, power-dependent, intrinsic loss and temperature-dependent resonance frequency shift of the resonators. From the TLS models, we expect a geometry-independent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, set by the TLS properties of the dielectric. However, we observe a thickness-dependent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, explained by surface layers that limit the performance of PPC-based resonators. For a uniform dielectric, the frequency noise level should scale directly inversely with the PPC area and thickness. We observe that an increase in PPC size reduces the frequency noise, but the exact scaling is, in some cases, weaker than expected. Finally, we derive an engineering guideline for the design of KIDs based on PPC-based resonators. ",

While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and compliance with electrical pumping of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their subsequent routing to a silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip generation of broadband telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly rejected. Two-photon interference with 92\\% visibility (and up to 99\\% upon 5 nm spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality characterizing the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture merging the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.

We focus on the difference between the concepts in the quantum context and the classic context. We also discuss the relation and distinction among entanglement, correlation, and coherence. We aim to clarify the rigorous definition of these concepts, and then indicate some examples in physical chemistry. ",

Excitons generated this way have the wave vector greater than the wave vector of the incident radiation. We suggest that optical orientation method is applicable to study the fine structure and kinetics of the hot excitons in semiconductor quantum well. ",

    "title": "Extracting Many-Body Quantum Resources within One-Body Reduced Density  Matrix Functional Theory",
    "abstract": "Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a central concept in quantum sciences used to quantify the ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation, detect quantum phase transitions, witness genuine multipartite entanglement, or probe nonlocality. Despite this widespread range of applications, computing the QFI value of quantum many-body systems is, in general, a very demanding task. Here we combine ideas from functional theories and quantum information to develop a novel functional framework for the QFI of fermionic and bosonic ground states. By relying upon the constrained-search approach, we demonstrate that the QFI matricial values can universally be determined by the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM), avoiding thus the use of exponentially large wave functions. Furthermore, we show that QFI functionals can be determined from the universal 1-RDM functional by calculating its derivatives with respect to the coupling strengths, becoming thus the generating functional of the QFI. We showcase our approach with the Bose-Hubbard model and present exact analytical and numerical QFI functionals. Our results provide the first connection between the one-body reduced density matrix functional theory and the quantum Fisher information. ",
