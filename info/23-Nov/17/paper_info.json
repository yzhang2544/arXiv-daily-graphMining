    "abstract": "The explosion of data volume in communications, AI training, and cloud computing requires efficient data handling, which is typically stored as digital electrical information and transmitted as wireless radio frequency (RF) signals or light waves in optical fibres. Today's communications systems mostly treat the RF and optical signals separately, which results in unnecessary conversion losses and increased cost. In this work, we report the first fully on-chip signal processor for high-speed RF and optical signals based on a silicon photonic circuit. Our chip is capable of both generation and detection of analog electrical and optical signals, and can program a user-defined filter response in both domains. The single silicon photonic chip integrates all essential components like modulators, optical filters, and photodetectors, as well as tunable lasers enabled by transfer-printed Indium Phosphide (InP) optical amplifiers. The system's configuration is locally programmed through thermo-optic phase shifters and monitored by photodetectors. We demonstrate our chip's capabilities with different combinations of RF and optical signal processing functions, including optical and RF signal generation and filtering. This represents a key step towards compact microwave photonic systems for future wireless communication and sensing applications. ",

    "abstract": "In FEL (Free-Electron Laser) accelerators, LLRF (Low-Level Radiofrequency) systems usually deploy feedback or feedforward algorithms requiring precise microwave measurement. The slow drift of the clock allocation network of LLRF significantly impacts the measured microwave phase, thereby affecting the stability of the closed-loop operation. The reference tracking algorithm is used to eliminate the measurement drift. The conventional algorithm is to perform phase and amplitude demodulation on the synchronous reference signal from the main oscillator and subtract the reference phase in other measurement channels. The demodulation is usually based on the CORDIC, which requires approximately 16 clock cycles in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). This paper uses the multiplication of complex numbers, which only requires four clock cycles of computational delay and achieves phase subtraction point by point. However, experiments show that it causes irrelevant amplitude noise to overlap and increase the amplitude measurement noise. Nevertheless, this reference tracking algorithm is suitable for control algorithms with low-delay requirements of microwave measurement. ",

    "abstract": "Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) is a phaseless imaging approach that can provide shape reconstruction and localization of objects using received signal strength (RSS) measurements. RSS measurements can be straightforwardly obtained from wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and therefore RTI has been extensively researched and accepted as a good indoor RF imaging technique. However, RTI is formulated on empirical models using an assumption of light-of-sight (LOS) propagation that does not account for intricate scattering effects. There are two main objectives of this work. The first objective is to reconcile and compare the empirical RTI model with formal inverse scattering approaches to better understand why RTI is an effective RF imaging technique. The second objective is to obtain straightforward enhancements to RTI, based on inverse scattering, to enhance its performance. The resulting enhancements can provide reconstructions of the shape and also material properties of the objects that can aid image classification. We also provide numerical and experimental results to compare RTI with the enhanced RTI for indoor imaging applications using low-cost 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi transceivers. These results show that the enhanced RTI can outperform RTI while having similar computational complexity to RTI. ",

Here, we develop and demonstrate a nonreciprocal field transformation in a 2D acoustic system, using an active metasurface that can independently control all constitutive parameters and achieve purely nonreciprocal Willis coupling. The field-transforming metasurface enables tailor-made field distribution manipulation, achieving localized field amplification by a predetermined ratio. Interestingly, the metasurface demonstrates the self-adaptive capability to various excitation conditions and can extend to other geometric shapes. The metasurface also achieves nonreciprocal wave propagation for internal and external excitations, demonstrating a one-way acoustic device. Such a field-transforming metasurface not only extends the framework of the transformation theory for nonreciprocal wave manipulation, but also holds significant potential in applications such as ultra-sensitive sensors and nonreciprocal communication.

The contribution of the electronic polarizability is computed from a state-of-the-art intramolecular potential and polarizability surface from the literature, and its small temperature dependence is quantified. The dipolar polarizability is calculated in a similar manner with an accurate literature dipole-moment surface; it differs from the classical result both due to the different molecular geometries sampled at different temperatures and due to the quantization of rotation. We calculate the dipolar contribution independently from spectroscopic information in the HITRAN2020 database and find that the two methods yield consistent results. The resulting first dielectric virial coefficient provides a complete description of the dielectric constant at low density that can be used in humidity metrology and as a boundary condition for new formulations for the static dielectric constant of water and heavy water.

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave,>30 GHz) radars are the key enabler in the coming 6G era for high-resolution sensing and detection of targets. Photonic radar provides an effective approach to overcome the limitations of electronic radars thanks to the high frequency, broad bandwidth, and excellent reconfigurability of photonic systems. However, conventional photonic radars are mostly realized in tabletop systems composed of bulky discrete components, whereas the more compact integrated photonic radars are difficult to reach the mmWave bands due to the unsatisfactory bandwidths and signal integrity of the underlining electro-optic modulators. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a centimeter-resolution integrated photonic radar operating in the mmWave V band (40-50 GHz) based on a 4-inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology. The fabricated TFLN mmWave photonic integrated circuit consists of a first electro-optic modulator capable of generating a broadband linear frequency modulated mmWave radar waveform through optical frequency multiplication of a low-frequency input signal, and a second electro-optic modulator responsible for frequency de-chirp of the received reflected echo wave, therefore greatly relieving the bandwidth requirements for the analog-to-digital converter in the receiver. Thanks to the absence of optical and electrical filters in the system, our integrated photonic mmWave radar features continuous on-demand tunability of the center frequency and bandwidth, currently only limited by the bandwidths of electrical amplifiers. We achieve multi-target ranging with a resolution of 1.50 cm and velocity measurement with a resolution of 0.067 m/s. Furthermore, we construct an inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) and successfully demonstrate the imaging of targets with various shapes and postures with a two-dimensional resolution of 1.50 cm * 1.06 cm.

We show that a generalized modulation of the local photonic losses allow creating topological modes both in the presence of periodicity and even in the quasiperiodic regime. We demonstrate that a localization transition of all the bulk photonic modes can be engineered in the presence of a quasiperiodic loss modulation, and we further demonstrate that such a transition can be created in the presence of both resonance frequency modulation and loss modulation. We finally address the robustness of this phenomenology to the presence of higher neighbor couplings and disorder in the emergence of criticality and topological modes. Our results put forward a strategy to engineer topology and criticality solely from engineered losses in a photonic system, establishing a potential platform to study the impact of non-linearities in topological and critical photonic matter.

So far its experimental realization has involved interactions mediated by rapidly escaping photons that do not play an active role in the emitter dynamics. Here we explore cooperative dynamics of quantum emitters in an optical lattice that interact by radiating atomic matter waves. Using the ability to prepare weakly and strongly interacting many-body phases of excitations in an array of matter-wave emitters, we demonstrate directional super- and subradiance from a superfluid phase with tunable radiative phase lags, and directly access the buildup of coherence imprinted by the emitted radiation across a Mott insulator. We investigate the onset of cooperative dynamics for slow wave propagation and observe a coupling to collective bound states with radiation trapped at and between the emitters. Our results in open-system quantum electrodynamics establish ultracold matter waves as a versatile tool for studying many-body quantum optics in spatially extended and ordered systems. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the development of various compact dynamic structured ansatze that are expected to be realizable in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, such ansatze construction strategies hitherto developed involve considerable pre-circuit measurements, and thus they deviate significantly in NISQ platform from their ideal structures. It is thus imperative that the usage of quantum resources must be minimized while retaining the expressivity and dynamical structure of the ansatz that can tailor itself depending on the degree of strong correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on the \\textit{ab-initio} many-body perturbation theory that requires \\textit{no} pre-circuit measurement and thus it remains structurally unaffected by any hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order as desired and hence are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that appears in higher perturbative orders into various low-rank operators, and thus keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a number of challenging applications on strongly correlated system, we demonstrate that our ansatz performs significantly better, both in terms of accuracy, parameter count and circuit depth, in comparison to the allied unitary coupled cluster based ansatze.
