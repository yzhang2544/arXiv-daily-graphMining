    "abstract": "X-ray free-electron lasers are sources of coherent, high-intensity X-rays with numerous applications in ultra-fast measurements and dynamic structural imaging. Due to the stochastic nature of the self-amplified spontaneous emission process and the difficulty in controlling injection of electrons, output pulses exhibit significant noise and limited temporal coherence. Standard measurement techniques used for characterizing two-coloured X-ray pulses are challenging, as they are either invasive or diagnostically expensive. In this work, we employ machine learning methods such as neural networks and decision trees to predict the central photon energies of pairs of attosecond fundamental and second harmonic pulses using parameters that are easily recorded at the high-repetition rate of a single shot. Using real experimental data, we apply a detailed feature analysis on the input parameters while optimizing the training time of the machine learning methods. Our predictive models are able to make predictions of central photon energy for one of the pulses without measuring the other pulse, thereby leveraging the use of the spectrometer without having to extend its detection window. We anticipate applications in X-ray spectroscopy using XFELs, such as in time-resolved X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy, where improved measurement of input spectra will lead to better experimental outcomes.

In this work, we applied a simple and compact fiber ring-resonator configuration that can stabilize both a continuous-wave laser and a self-referenced optical frequency comb to a vibration-insensitive optical fiber delay-line. We could achieve a thermal-noise-limited frequency noise level in the 10 Hz - 1 kHz offset frequency range for both the continuous-wave laser and the optical frequency comb with the minimal frequency instability of 2.7x10-14 at 0.03-s and 2.6x10-14 at 0.01-s averaging time, respectively, in non-vacuum condition. The optical fiber spool, working as a delay reference, is designed to be insensitive to external vibration, with a vibration sensitivity of sub-10-10 [1/g] and volume of 32 mL. Finally, the ring-resonator setup is packaged in a palm-sized aluminum case with 171-mL volume with a vibration-insensitive spool, as well as an even smaller 97-mL-volume case with an ultra-compact 9-mL miniaturized fiber spool.

The evolution of the electron beam polarization is studied based on the Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for the transverse and longitudinal self-injection, and the depolarization process is found to be influenced by the injection schemes. In the case of transverse self-injection as found typically in the bubble regime, the spin precession of the accelerated electrons is mainly influenced by the wakefield. However, in the case of longitudinal injection in the quasi-one-dimensional regime (for example, F. Y. Li \\emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 135002 (2013)), the direction of electron spin oscillates in the laser filed. Since the electrons move around the laser axis, the net influence of the laser field is nearly zero and the contribution of the wakefield can be ignored. Finally, an ultra-short electron beam with polarization of $99\\%$ can be obtained using longitudinal self-injection. ",

In such lattices, the Hamiltonian's hopping and on-site terms determine the optical evolution, which can be engineered using waveguide spacing and refractive index profile. While waveguide lattices have been realized in various photonic platforms, these devices have always been static and designed for specific applications. We present a programmable waveguide array in which the Hamiltonian terms can be electro-optically tuned to implement various Hamiltonian continuous-time evolutions on a single device. We used a single array with 11 waveguides in lithium niobate, controlled via 22 electrodes, to perform a range of experiments that realized the Su-Schriffer-Heeger model, the Aubrey-Andre model, and Anderson localization, which is equivalent to over 2500 static devices. Our architecture's micron-scale local electric fields independently control waveguide coupling coefficients and effective indices, which overcomes cross-talk limitations of thermo-optic phase shifters in other platforms such as silicon, silicon-nitride, and silica. Electro-optic control allows for ultra-fast and more precise reconfigurability with lower power consumption, and with quantum input states, our platform can enable the study of multiple condensed matter quantum dynamics with a single device.

    "abstract": "We investigate the hot electrons generated from two-plasmon decay (TPD) instability driven by laser pulses with intensity modulated by a frequency $\\Delta \\omega_m$. Our primary focus lies on scenarios where $\\Delta \\omega_m$ is on the same order of the TPD growth rate $ \\gamma_0$ ( $\\Delta \\omega_m \\sim \\gamma_0$), corresponding to moderate laser frequency bandwidths for TPD mitigation. With $\\Delta \\omega_m$ conveniently modeled by a basic two-color scheme of the laser wave fields in fully-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that the energies of TPD modes and hot electrons exhibit intermittent evolution at the frequency $\\Delta \\omega_m$, particularly when $\\Delta \\omega_m \\sim \\gamma_0$. With the dynamic TPD behavior, the overall ratio of hot electron energy to the incident laser energy, $f_{hot}$, changes significantly with $\\Delta \\omega_m$. While $f_{hot}$ drops notably with increasing $\\Delta \\omega_m$ at large $\\Delta \\omega_m$ limit as expected, it goes anomalously beyond the hot electron energy ratio for a single-frequency incident laser pulse with the same average intensity when $\\Delta \\omega_m$ falls below a specific threshold frequency $\\Delta \\omega_c$. We find this threshold frequency primarily depends on $\\gamma_0$ and the collisional damping rate of plasma waves, with relatively lower sensitivity to the density scale length. We develop a scaling model characterizing the relation of $\\Delta \\omega_c$ and laser plasma conditions, enabling the potential extention of our findings to more complex and realistic scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "An optomechanical microcavity can considerably enhance the interaction between light and mechanical motion by confining light to a sub-wavelength volume. However, this comes at the cost of an increased optical loss rate. Therefore, microcavity-based optomechanical systems are placed in the unresolved-sideband regime, preventing sideband-based ground-state cooling. A pathway to reduce optical loss in such systems is to engineer the cavity mirrors, i.e., the optical modes that interact with the mechanical resonator. In our work, we analyze such an optomechanical system, whereby one of the mirrors is strongly frequency-dependent, i.e., a suspended Fano mirror. This optomechanical system consists of two optical modes that couple to the motion of the suspended Fano mirror. We formulate a quantum-coupled-mode description that includes both the standard dispersive optomechanical coupling as well as dissipative coupling. We solve the Langevin equations of the system dynamics in the linear regime showing that ground-state cooling from room temperature can be achieved even if the cavity is per se not in the resolved-sideband regime, but achieves effective sideband resolution through strong optical mode coupling. Importantly, we find that the cavity output spectrum needs to be properly analyzed with respect to the effective laser detuning to infer the phonon occupation of the mechanical resonator. Our work also predicts how to reach the regime of nonlinear quantum optomechanics in a Fano-based microcavity by engineering the properties of the Fano mirror. ",

We simulate the quantum reflection process in a one-dimensional model with a slow-moving atom moving in a Morse potential in the presence of an applied laser field. We show that in the case of laser-assisted quantum reflection, the laser field imparts additional momentum and kinetic energy to the atom. This results in a decreased distance of closest approach between the atom and surface. Our results show that the distance of closest approach and can be controlled through the timing and intensity of the laser pulse, which may result in enhanced sticking probability and/or reduced quantum reflection probability.

The OBBs are generated by assembling generalized perfect optical vortices based on the free lens modulation (FLM) method, by which the beams shape, intensity, and position can be elaborately designed with size independent of topological charge. Using the OBBs with high quality and high efficiency, we realized rotating LRI particles along arbitrary trajectories with controllable speed and parallel manipulation of multiple LRI particles. Importantly, we further achieved the sorting of LRI particles by size with specially structured OBBs. With unprecedented flexibility and quality, OBBs provide tremendous potential in optical trapping, lithography, and biomedicine. ",

    "abstract": "Resonant enhancement of nonlinear photonic processes is critical for the scalability of applications such as long-distance entanglement generation. To implement nonlinear resonant enhancement, multiple resonator modes must be individually tuned onto a precise set of process wavelengths, which requires multiple linearly-independent tuning methods. Using coupled auxiliary resonators to indirectly tune modes in a multi-resonant nonlinear cavity is particularly attractive because it allows the extension of a single physical tuning mechanism, such as thermal tuning, to provide the required independent controls. Here we model and simulate the performance and tradeoffs of a coupled-resonator tuning scheme which uses auxiliary resonators to tune specific modes of a multi-resonant nonlinear process. Our analysis determines the tuning bandwidth for steady-state mode field intensity can significantly exceed the inter-cavity coupling rate if the total quality factor of the auxiliary resonator is higher than the multi-mode main resonator. Consequently, over-coupling a nonlinear resonator mode to improve the maximum efficiency of a frequency conversion process will simultaneously expand the auxiliary resonator tuning bandwidth for that mode, indicating a natural compatibility with this tuning scheme. We apply the model to an existing small-diameter triply-resonant ring resonator design and find that a tuning bandwidth of 136 GHz ~ 1.1 nm can be attained for a mode in the telecom band while limiting excess scattering losses to a quality factor of 10^6. Such range would span the distribution of inhomogeneously broadened quantum emitter ensembles as well as resonator fabrication variations, indicating the potential for the auxiliary resonators to enable not only low-loss telecom conversion but also the generation of indistinguishable photons in a quantum network.

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have emerged as innovative and energy-efficient means to manipulate domain walls (DWs) and skyrmions in thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) owing to the magnetoelastic coupling effect. This thesis focuses on the complex interplay between SAWs and magnetic thin films. The effects of the standing SAWs on the magnetisation dynamics in a Ta/Pt/Co/Ir/Ta thin film with PMA were first investigated. SAWs with frequency of 93.35 MHz significantly reduced the coercivity of the thin film by 21% and enhanced the magnetisation reversal speed by 11-fold. Standing SAWs introduce a dynamic energy landscape with a unique spatial distribution, forming striped domain patterns in the thin film. The use of rf signals for generating SAWs inevitably causes a heating effect in the device. This heating effect was examined in situ in a SAW device featuring a Ta/Pt/Co/Ta thin film with PMA using an on-chip platinum thermometer. The temperature increased by 10 K in the presence of SAWs at centre frequency of 48 MHz. The DW velocity was significantly enhanced in the presence of the standing SAWs by a factor of 4 compared to that with temperature change alone owing to the magnetoelastic coupling effect. To understand the SAW-enhanced DW motion, comprehensive micromagnetic simulations were performed on thin films in the presence of travelling SAWs. The findings highlighted that SAW-induced vertical Bloch lines within DWs can simultaneously boost DW depinning and dissipate energy at the DW via spin rotation. The SAW-induced strain gradient can be exploited to control skyrmion motion in a current-free manner. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that the use of orthogonal SAWs, combining horizontal travelling and vertical standing waves, offered a promising approach to direct skyrmion motion along desired trajectories, avoiding undesirable Hall-like motion.

In contrast to the conventional designs, this Quantum Channel (QC) confinement is controlled by epilayer design and the polarization field and not by the electron sheet density. As a result, the breakdown field at low sheet carrier densities increases by approximately 36% or even more because the quantization leads to an effective increase in the energy gap. In addition, better confinement increases the electron mobility at low sheet carrier densities by approximately 50%. Another advantage is the possibility of increasing the aluminum molar fraction in the barrier layer because a very thin layer prevents material relaxation and the development of dislocation arrays. This makes the QC especially suitable for high-voltage, high-frequency, high-temperature, and radiation-hard applications. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand for room-temperature visible single-photon emission from InGaN nanowire-quantum-dots (NWQDs) due to its potential in developing quantum computing, sensing, and communication technologies. Despite various approaches explored for growing InGaN quantum dots on top of nanowires (NWs), achieving the emission of a single photon at room temperature with sensible efficiency remains a challenge. This challenge is primarily attributed to difficulties in accomplishing the radial confinement limit and the inherent giant built-in potential of the NWQD. In this report, we have employed a novel Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE) growth approach to reduce the diameter of the QD to the excitonic Bohr radius of InGaN, thereby achieving strong lateral confinement. Additionally, we have successfully suppressed the strong built-in potential by reducing the QD diameter. Toward the end of the report, we have demonstrated single-photon emission (${\\lambda}$ = 561 nm) at room-temperature from the NWQD and measured the second-order correlation function $g^{2}(0)$ as 0.11, which is notably low compared to other reported findings. Furthermore, the lifetime of carriers in the QD is determined to be 775 ps, inferring a high operational speed of the devices. ",

We focus on tunnelling through the barrier created by a strong laser field that illuminates an atomic target, which is essential to the creation of attosecond pulses and ultimately all attosecond processes. Here, we present an optical tunnelling event that, unexpectedly, happens at a time when the instantaneous electric field is zero and there is no barrier. We discover this strong-field ionisation event by introducing the colour-switchover technique $-$ the gradual replacement of a laser field with its second harmonic $-$ within which the zero-field tunnelling appears when the two amplitudes are equal. This event is a topologically stable feature and it appears at all Keldysh parameters. The tunnelling without a barrier highlights the disconnect between the standard intuition built on the picture of a quasi-static barrier, and the nonadiabatic nature of the process. Our findings provide a key ingredient to the understanding of strong-field processes, such as high-harmonic generation and laser-induced electron diffraction, driven by the increasingly accessible class of strongly polychromatic light fields.

Even with existing site-controlled growth techniques, for example, nanohole or buried stressor concepts, a further lithography and etching step with high spatial alignment requirements isnecessary to accurately integrate QDs into the nanophotonic devices. Here, we report on the fabrication and characterization of strain-induced site-controlled microcavities where site-controlled quantum dots are positioned at the antinode of the optical mode field in a self-aligned manner without the need of any further nano-processing. We show that the Q-factor, mode volume, height, and the ellipticity of site-controlled microcavities can be tailored by the size of an integrated AlAs/Al2O3 buried stressor, with an opening ranging from 1 to 4 $\\mu$m. Lasing signatures, including super-linear input-output response, linewidth narrowing near threshold, and gain competition above threshold, are observed for a 3.6-$\\mu$m self-aligned cavity with a Q-factor of 18000. Furthermore, by waiving the rather complex lateral nano-structuring usually performed during the fabrication process of micropillar lasers and vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers, quasi-planar site-controlled cavities exhibit no detrimental effects of excitation power induced heating and thermal rollover. Our straightforward deterministic nanofabrication concept of high-quality quantum dot microcavities integrates seamlessly with the industrial-matured manufacturing process and the buried-stressor techniques, paving the way for exceptional scalability and straightforward manufacturing of high-\\b{eta} microlasers and bright quantum light sources.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate how motional degrees of freedom in optical tweezers can be used as quantum information carriers. To this end, we first implement a species-agnostic cooling mechanism via conversion of motional excitations into erasures - errors with a known location - reminiscent of Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We find that this cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate in specific scenarios. By coherently manipulating the motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection of an optical qubit via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers, and utilize this to generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits. This work shows how controlling motion enriches the toolbox of quantum information processing with neutral atoms, and opens unique prospects for metrology enhanced by mid-circuit readout and a large class of quantum operations enabled via hyper-entanglement.

    "title": "Quartz Crystal Microbalance frequency response to finite-size adsorbents  in liquid",
    "abstract": "Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) has become a major tool in the analysis of adsorption of nanometric objects, such as proteins, viruses, liposomes and inorganic particles from the solution. While in vacuum extremely accurate mass measurements are possible, in a liquid phase the quantitative analysis is intricate due to the complex interplay of hydrodynamic and adhesion forces, varying with the physicochemical properties of adsorbent and the quartz resonator surfaces. In the present paper we dissect the role of hydrodynamics for the analytically tractable scenario of a stiff contact, whereas the adsorbed particles oscillate with the resonator as a whole without rotation. Under the assumption of the low surface coverage, we theoretically study the excess shear force exerted on the resonator due to presence of a single adsorbed particle. The excess shear force has two contributions: (i) the fluid-mediated force due to flow disturbance created by the particle and (ii) the viscous force exerted on the particle by the fluid and transmitted to the resonator via contact. We found that for small enough particles there is a mutual cancellation of the above dual components of the net excess shear force, reducing the overall effect of the hydrodynamics to that comparable in magnitude to the inertial force. These findings indicate that the accurate account of hydrodynamics in the analysis of QCM-D response is as important as the inertial mass of the adsorbents (determining the frequency shift in the Sauerbrey equation). The resulting dimensionless frequency and dissipation shifts and the corresponding acoustic ratio computed numerically, showing a fair agreement with previously published experimental results at low oscillation frequencies.

    "abstract": "We propose, and theoretically analyze, a practical protocol for the creation of topological monopole configurations, quantum knots, and skyrmions in Bose--Einstein condensates by employing fictitious magnetic fields induced by the interaction of the atomic cloud with coherent light fields. It is observed that a single coherent field is not enough for this purpose, but instead we find incoherent superpositions of several coherent fields that introduce topological point charges. We numerically estimate the experimentally achievable strengths and gradients of the induced fictitious magnetic fields and find them to be adjustable at will to several orders of magnitude greater than those of the physical magnetic fields employed in previous experimental studies. This property together with ultrafast control of the optical fields paves the way for advanced engineering of topological defects in quantum gases. ",

    "title": "Evaluation of microscale crystallinity modification induced by laser  writing on Mn3O4 thin films",
    "abstract": "Defining microstructures and managing local crystallinity allow the implementation of several functionalities in thin film technology. The use of ultrashort Bessel beams for bulk crystallinity modification has garnered considerable attention as a versatile technique for semiconductor materials, dielectrics, or metal oxide substrates. The aim of this work is the quantitative evaluation of the crystalline changes induced by ultrafast laser micromachining on manganese oxide thin films using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Pulsed Bessel beams featured by a 1 micrometer-sized central core are used to define structures with high spatial precision. The dispersion relation of Mn3O4 optical phonons is determined by considering the conjunction between X-ray diffraction characterization and the phonon localization model. The asymmetries in Raman spectra indicate phonon localization and enable a quantitative tool to determine the crystallite size at micrometer resolution. The results indicate that laser-writing is effective in modifying the low-crystallinity films locally, increasing crystallite sizes from ~8 nm up to 12 nm, and thus highlighting an interesting approach to evaluate laser-induced structural modifications on metal oxide thin films.
