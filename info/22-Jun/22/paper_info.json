    "abstract": "The generation of compact, high-energy ion beams is one of the most promising applications of intense laser-matter interactions, but the control of the beam spectral quality remains an outstanding challenge. We show that in radiation pressure acceleration of a thin solid target the onset of electron heating is determined by the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability at the front surface and must be controlled to produce ion beams with high spectral quality in the light sail regime. The growth rate of the instability imposes an upper limit on the laser pulse duration and intensity to achieve high spectral beam quality and we demonstrate that under this optimal regime, the maximum peak ion beam energy per nucleon is independent of target density, composition, and laser energy (transverse spot size). Our predictions are validated by two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, which indicate that for recent and upcoming experimental facilities using ultrashort ($\\lesssim 25$ fs) laser pulses it is possible to produce $100 - 300$ MeV proton beams with $\\sim 30\\%$ energy spread and high laser-to-proton energy conversion efficiency.

In divalent atoms, two-stage Doppler cooling is typically used to bring atoms to the uK regime. Here, we implement a pulsed radial cooling scheme using the ultranarrow 1S0-3P0 clock transition in ytterbium to realize sub-recoil temperatures, down to tens of nK. Together with sideband cooling along the one-dimensional lattice axis, we efficiently prepare atoms in shallow lattices at an energy of 6 lattice recoils. Under these conditions key limits on lattice clock accuracy and instability are reduced, opening the door to dramatic improvements.

Since the multiplexer is considered for both bolometric and calorimetric applications across several orders of magnitude of signal frequencies, understanding the bandwidth of the device and its interaction with readout electronics is key to appropriately designing and engineering systems. Here we discuss several important factors contributing to the bandwidth properties of umux systems, including the intrinsic device bandwidth, interactions with warm electronics readout systems, and aliasing.

    "abstract": "The co-packaging of optics and electronics provides a potential path forward to achieving beyond 50 Tbps top of rack switch packages. In a co-packaged design, the scaling of bandwidth, cost, and energy is governed by the number of optical transceivers (TxRx) per package as opposed to transistor shrink. Due to the large footprint of optical components relative to their electronic counterparts, the vertical stacking of optical TxRx chips in a co-packaged optics design will become a necessity. As a result, development of efficient, dense, and wide alignment tolerance chip-to-chip optical couplers will be an enabling technology for continued TxRx scaling. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to vertically couple into standard 220 nm silicon on insulator waveguides from 220 nm silicon nitride on glass waveguides using overlapping, inverse double tapers. Simulation results using Lumerical's 3D Finite Difference Time Domain solver solver are presented, demonstrating insertion losses below -0.13 dB for an inter-chip spacing of 1 $\\mu$m, 1 dB vertical and lateral alignment tolerances of approximately $\\pm$ 2.7 $\\mu$m, a greater than 300 nm 1 dB bandwidth, and 1 dB twist and tilt tolerance of approximately 2.3 degrees and 0.4 degrees, respectively.

Yet, progress towards implementing low loss, low power modulators in the silicon nitride platform, while maintaining the planar, wafer-scale process compatibility has been limited. Here we report a significant advance in integration of a piezo-electric (PZT) actuated micro-ring modulation in a fully-planar, wafer-scale silicon nitride platform, that maintains low optical loss (0.03 dB/cm in a 625 um resonator) at 1550 nm, with an order of magnitude increase in bandwidth (DC to 20 MHz 3-dB) and order of magnitude lower power consumption of 20 nW improvement over prior PZT modulators. The modulator provides a >14 dB ER and 7.1 million Q over the entire 4 GHz tuning range, a tuning efficiency of 200 MHz/V, and delivers the linearity required for control applications with 65.1 dBHz2/3 and 73.8 dBHz2/3 IMD3 SFDR at 1 MHz and 10 MHz respectively. We demonstrate two control applications, laser stabilization in a PDH lock loop, reducing laser frequency noise by 40 dB, and as a laser carrier tracking filter. This PZT modulator design can be extended to the visible in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride platform with minor waveguide design changes. This integration of PZT modulation in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide platform enables modulator control functions in a wide range of visible to IR applications such as atomic and molecular transition locking for cooling, controllable optical frequency combs, low-power external cavity tunable lasers, atomic clocks, and tunable ultra-low linewidth lasers and ultra-low phase noise microwave synthesizers.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning (ML) can distinguish multiple pathogen species and strains, but processing complex fluid samples to sensitively and specifically detect pathogens remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we develop an acoustic bioprinting platform to digitize samples into millions of droplets, each containing just a few cells, which are then identified with SERS and ML. As a proof of concept, we focus on bacterial bloodstream infections. We demonstrate ~2pL droplet generation from solutions containing S. epidermidis, E. coli, and mouse red blood cells (RBCs) mixed with gold nanorods (GNRs) at 1 kHz ejection rates; use of parallel printing heads would enable processing of mL-volume samples in minutes. Droplets printed with GNRs achieve spectral enhancements of up to 1500x compared to samples printed without GNRs. With this improved signal-to-noise, we train an ML model on droplets consisting of either pure cells with GNRs or mixed, multicellular species with GNRs, using scanning electron microscopy images as our ground truth. We achieve >=99% classification accuracy of droplets printed from cellularly-pure samples, and >=87% accuracy in droplets printed from mixtures of S. epidermidis, E. coli, and RBCs. We compute the feature importance at each wavenumber and confirm that the most significant spectral bands for classification correspond to biologically relevant Raman peaks within our cells. This combined acoustic droplet ejection, SERS and ML platform could enable clinical and industrial translation of SERS-based cellular identification. ",

In addition, we measure the hyperfine structure of the 7P$_{1/2}$ energy level based on the heterodyne measurements, and calculate the magnetic dipole constant $A$ of the Cs 7P$_{1/2}$ level to be 94.38(6) MHz, which agrees well with previous measurements.

    "abstract": "Temporal cavity solitons (CSs) are pulses of light that can persist endlessly in dispersive, nonlinear optical resonators. They have been extensively studied in the context of resonators with purely cubic (Kerr-type) nonlinearity that are externally-driven with a monochromatic continuous wave laser -- in such systems, the solitons manifest themselves as unique attractors whose carrier frequency coincides with that of the external driving field. Recent experiments have, however, shown that a qualitatively different type of temporal CS can arise via parametric down-conversion in resonators with simultaneous quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. In contrast to conventional CSs in pure-Kerr resonators, these \\emph{parametrically-driven cavity solitons} come in two different flavours with opposite phases, and they are spectrally centred at half of the frequency of the driving field. Here, we theoretically and numerically show that, under conditions of bichromatic driving, such parametrically-driven CSs can also arise in dispersive resonators with pure Kerr nonlinearity. In this case, the solitons arise through parametric four-wave mixing, come with two distinct phases, and have a carrier frequency in between the two external driving fields. We show that, when all waves are resonant, the solitons can experience long-range interactions due to their back-action on the intracavity fields at the pump frequencies, and we discuss the parameter requirements for the solitons' existence. Besides underlining the possibility of exciting a new type of cavity soliton in dispersive Kerr cavities, our work advances the theoretical modeling of resonators that are coherently-driven with polychromatic fields.

    "abstract": "Recently, the development of machine learning (ML) potentials has made it possible to perform large-scale and long-time molecular simulations with the accuracy of quantum mechanical (QM) models. However, for high-level QM methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) at the meta-GGA level and/or with exact exchange, quantum Monte Carlo, etc., generating a sufficient amount of data for training a ML potential has remained computationally challenging due to their high cost. In this work, we demonstrate that this issue can be largely alleviated with Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS), a ML-based DFT model. DeePKS employs a computationally efficient neural network-based functional model to construct a correction term added upon a cheap DFT model. Upon training, DeePKS offers closely-matched energies and forces compared with high-level QM method, but the number of training data required is orders of magnitude less than that required for training a reliable ML potential. As such, DeePKS can serve as a bridge between expensive QM models and ML potentials: one can generate a decent amount of high-accuracy QM data to train a DeePKS model, and then use the DeePKS model to label a much larger amount of configurations to train a ML potential. This scheme for periodic systems is implemented in a DFT package ABACUS, which is open-source and ready for use in various applications. ",

Although the active stabilization of a THz QCL dual-comb source was demonstrated by phase locking one of the dual-comb lines, the full stabilization of all dual-comb lines is still challenging. Here, we propose a self-reference method to obtain a fully stabilized dual-comb signal on a pure THz QCL platform. Without using any external locking components, we filter out one dual-comb line and beat it with the whole dual-comb signal, which eliminates the common carrier offset frequency noise and reduces the dual-comb repetition frequency noise. It is experimentally demonstrated that the self-reference technique can significantly improve the long-term stability of the dual-comb signal. A record of the ``maxhold\" linewidth of 14.8 kHz (60 s time duration) is obtained by implementing the self-reference technique, while without the self-reference the dual-comb lines show a ``maxhold\" linewidth of 2 MHz (15 s time duration). The method provides the simplest way to improve the long-term stability of THz QCL dual-comb sources, which can be further adopted for high precision measurements. ",

Staggered InGaN quantum wells (QWs) have been proposed to increase the wavefunction overlap and improve the efficiency of LEDs especially for long wavelength emitters. In this work we evidence that the growth of staggered QWs has also another beneficial effect as it allows to reduce the formation of defects, responsible for nonradiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, at the bottom interface of the QW. Staggered QWs comprised an InGaN layer of an intermediate In content between the barrier and the QW. We show that insertion of such a layer results in a significant increase of the luminescence intensity, even if the calculated wavefunction overlap drops. We study the dependence of the thickness of such an intermediate In content layer on photoluminescence (PL) intensity behavior. Staggered QWs exhibit increased cathodoluminescence (CL) homogeneity that is a fingerprint of lower density of defects, in contrast to standard QWs for which high density of dark spots are observed in QW emission mapping. Transmission electron microscopy of standard QWs revealed formation of basal-plane stacking faults (BSFs) and voids that could have resulted from vacancy aggregation. Stepwise increase of the In content in staggered QWs prevents formation of point defects and results in an increased luminescence efficiency. The In composition difference between the barrier and the well is therefore a key parameter to control the formation of point defects in the high-In content QWs, influencing the luminescence efficiency.

    "abstract": "Polyynes are linear carbon chains characterized by alternated single and triple bonds and terminated by hydrogen or other terminal substituents. They can be synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) as a scalable, cost-effective, and fast physical technique. Water can be employed as a solvent for PLAL to avoid toxicity problems and to reduce costs compared to organic solvents. However, in this case, the production yield of polyynes reached is extremely low and prevents further characterization and implementation in new functional materials. In this work, we synthesized polyynes by pulsed laser ablation in water and we optimized the process parameters to improve the yield of polyynes by PLAL. Then, we developed a procedure entirely based on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) which effectively enables the concentration, separation and collection of polyynes according to their length. Since the polyynes sample is an aqueous solution, we could inject it directly into the RP-HPLC column without the dilution step required in the case of a sample in an organic solvent. Thanks to our single RP-HPLC procedure, it is possible to highly increase the concentration and separately characterize different size-selected polyynes for further use in functional materials. ",

Usually, DKS pulses are generated in traveling-wave ring-resonators driven by continuous-wave lasers. Although immensely successful, conventional ring-resonators offer only few design parameters, limiting the potential of DKS. Here, we demonstrate for the first time CW-driven DKS in a high-Q standing-wave Fabry-Perot microresonator. In contrast to conventional ring-type resonators, two photonic crystal reflectors in a waveguide define the resonator, opening a large design space with prospects for future extension of DKS to visible wavelengths and other spectral domains that are so far inaccessible. The chip-integrated resonator is compatible with wafer-level fabrication and its intrinsic Q-factor of 2.8 million is on-par with ring-resonators. Beyond DKS, this creates opportunities for filter-driven pulse formation, engineered spectra and, more generally, phase-matching for broadband frequency conversion in integrated nonlinear photonics.

Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) of van der Waals semiconductors couple strongly with THz and LWIR radiation. However, the mismatch of photon-polariton momentum makes far-field excitation of HPhPs challenging. Here, we propose an In-Plane Hyperbolic Polariton Tuner and demonstrate a first device responding to direct far-field excitation and giving rise to a unique set of characteristic functions at far-field. Such a device is based on patterned surface directly written on van der Waals semiconductors; here {\\alpha}-MoO3. The resonances are found to strongly rely on in-plane hyperbolic polariton of patterned {\\alpha}-MoO3, exhibiting high quality factors up to 300, and to determine the characteristics of resultant tunable polarization and selection of the wavelength of reflection and transmission and regulation of output intensity. This is important to development of THz and LWIR miniaturized devices. ",

The simulation-generated exact field information lead to the exploration of the unique Goos-H\\\"anchen, Imbert-Fedorov and spin shifts of the optical-singular fields and the anticipation of an exact mathematical characterization of spin-orbit interaction phenomena involved therein. The formation of a phase singularity independent of a polarization singularity is explained subsequently. Interrelating these seemingly unconnected beam-field phenomena and generic optical singularities can lead to a significant and fundamental understanding of the inhomogeneously polarized beam-field; and additionally, our singularity generation method can find potential application in experimental characterization of the involved dielectric media.

Standard methods have been elusive for large systems because of the enormous number of observables to be measured and the exponential complexity of data post-processing. Here, we propose a new scheme of quantum state tomography that requires the measurement of only three observables (acting jointly on the system and pointer) regardless of the size of the system. The system is coupled to a \"pointer\" of single qubit, and the wavefunction of the system is \"reaped\" onto the pointer upon the measurement of the system. Subsequently, standard two-state tomography on the pointer and classical post-processing are used to reconstruct the quantum state of the system.

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) quantify the minimal energetic cost of achieving a certain precision in determining a nonequilibrium current. They represent one of the few broad-based and fundamental relations in our toolbox for tackling the thermodynamics of nonequilibrium systems. In this initial stage of our research program our goal is to provide the quantum basis of TURs using microphysics models of linear open quantum systems. In our first paper [1] we show how TURs are rooted in the quantum uncertainty principles and the fluctuation-dissipation inequalities (FDI) under nonequilibrium conditions. In this paper we shift our attention from the quantum basis to the thermal manifests. Using a microscopic model for the bath's spectral density in quantum Brownian motion studies, we formulate a \"thermal\" FDI in the quantum nonequilibrium dynamics which is valid at high temperatures. This brings the quantum TURs we derive here to the classical domain and can thus be compared with some popular forms of TURs. In the thermal energy-dominated regimes our FDIs provide better estimates on the uncertainty of thermodynamic quantities. Our treatment includes full back-action from the environment onto the system. As a concrete example of the generalized current, we examine the energy flux or power entering the Brownian particle and find an exact expression of the corresponding current-current correlations. In so doing we show that the statistical properties of the bath and the causality of the system+bath interaction both enter into the TURs observed by the thermodynamic quantities. ",

Several developments have already shown that accurate ground-state energies for small molecules can be evaluated on present-day quantum devices. Although electronically excited states play a vital role in chemical processes and applications, the search for a reliable and practical approach for routine excited-state calculations on near-term quantum devices is ongoing. Inspired by excited-state methods developed for the unitary coupled-cluster theory in quantum chemistry, we present an equation-of-motion-based method to compute excitation energies following the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm for ground-state calculations on a quantum computer. We perform numerical simulations on H$_2$, H$_4$, H$_2$O, and LiH molecules to test our equation-of-motion variational quantum eigensolver (EOM-VQE) method and compare it to other current state-of-the-art methods. EOM-VQE makes use of self-consistent operators to satisfy the vacuum annihilation condition. It provides accurate and size-intensive energy differences corresponding to vertical excitation energies along with vertical ionization potentials and electron affinities. We also find that EOM-VQE is more suitable for implementation on NISQ devices, as it does not require higher than 2-body reduced density matrices and is expected to be noise-resilient. ",
