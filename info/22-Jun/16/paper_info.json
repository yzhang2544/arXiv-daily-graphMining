    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a pre-trained-combined neural network (PTCN) as a comprehensive solution to the inverse design of an integrated photonic circuit. By utilizing both the initially pre-trained inverse and forward model with a joint training process, our PTCN model shows remarkable tolerance to the quantity and quality of the training data. As a proof of concept demonstration, the inverse design of a wavelength demultiplexer is used to verify the effectiveness of the PTCN model. The correlation coefficient of the prediction by the presented PTCN model remains greater than 0.974 even when the size of training data is decreased to 17%. The experimental results show a good agreement with predictions, and demonstrate a wavelength demultiplexer with an ultra-compact footprint, a high transmission efficiency with a transmission loss of -2dB, a low reflection of -10dB, and low crosstalk around -7dB simultaneously.

    "abstract": "We provide Python tools enabling numerical simulation and analysis of the propagation dynamics of ultrashort laser pulses in nonlinear waveguides. The modeling approach is based on the widely used generalized nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation for the pulse envelope. The presented software implements the effects of linear dispersion, pulse self-steepening, and the Raman effect. The focus lies on the implementation of input pulse shot noise, i.e. classical background fields that mimick quantum noise, which are often not thoroughly presented in the scientific literature. We discuss and implement commonly adopted quantum noise models based on pure spectral phase noise, as well as Gaussian noise. Coherence properties of the resulting spectra can be calculated. We demonstrate the functionality of the software by reproducing results for a supercontinuum generation process in a photonic crystal fiber, documented in the scientific literature. The presented Python tools are are open-source and released under the MIT license in a publicly available software repository. ",

These originate from a Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) process driven by the active medium's third-order non-linearity. The study of such correlations is essential for the engineering of a new generation of semiconductor devices with the potential of becoming integrated emitters of light with quantum properties, such as squeezing and entanglement. Starting from experimental results, the limits of state-of-the-art technology are discussed as well as the possible methodologies that could lead to the detection of non-classical phenomena, or alternatively improve the design of QCLs, in the compelling perspective of generating quantum correlations in mid-infrared light.

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) provide a promising approach to achieving quantum advantage for practical problems on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus far, intensive studies on qubit-based VQAs have been made theoretically and experimentally on several physical platforms. However, there have been much fewer theoretical proposals and no experimental implementations on continuous-variable (CV) VQAs, although CV quantum computing can process infinite-dimensional quantum information even on single-mode devices and thus has great potential in the NISQ era. Here, we implement the CV version of one of the most typical VQAs, a quantum approximate optimization algorithm, on a single-mode programmable photonic quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate that this algorithm solves a minimization problem of a given continuous real-valued function by implementing the quantum version of gradient descent and localizing an initially broadly-distributed wavefunction to the minimum of the given function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration ever of a practical CV quantum algorithm on any physical platform, except for Gaussian Boson sampling. Our work highlights the power of CV quantum computing in the NISQ era, opening a new door to the quantum advantage in practical problems. ",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying magnetoreception has long eluded explanation. A popular hypothesis attributes this sense to the quantum coherent spin dynamics of spin-selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the protein cryptochrome. However, concerns about the validity of the hypothesis have been raised as unavoidable inter-radical interactions, such as strong electron-electron dipolar coupling, appear to suppress its sensitivity. We demonstrate that this can be overcome by driving the spin system through a modulation of the inter-radical distance. It is shown that this dynamical process markedly enhances geomagnetic field sensitivity in strongly coupled radical pairs via a Landau-Zener type transition between singlet and triplet states. These findings suggest that a \"live\" harmonically driven magnetoreceptor can be more sensitive than its \"dead\" static counterpart. ",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of analytic continuation of imaginary-frequency Green's functions, which is crucial in many-body physics, using machine learning based on a multi-level residual neural network. We specifically address potential biases that can be introduced due to the use of artificially created spectral functions that are employed to train the neural network. We also implement an uncertainty estimation of the predicted spectral function, based on Monte Carlo dropout, which allows to identify frequency regions where the prediction might not be accurate, and we study the effect of noise, in particular also for situations where the noise level during training is different from that in the actual data. Our analysis demonstrates that this method can indeed achieve a high quality of prediction, comparable or better than the widely used maximum entropy method, but that further improvement is currently limited by the lack of true data that can be used for training. We also benchmark our approach by applying it to the case of SrVO$_3$, where an accurate spectral function has been obtained from dynamical mean-field theory using a solver that works directly on the real frequency axis.

    "abstract": "Amorphous silicon (a-Si) is an important thermal-management material and also serves as an ideal playground for studying heat transport in strongly disordered materials. Theoretical prediction of the thermal conductivity of a-Si in a wide range of temperatures and sample sizes is still a challenge. Herein we present a systematic investigation of the thermal transport properties of a-Si by employing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained against abundant reference data calculated at the quantum-mechanical density-functional-theory level. The high efficiency of NEP allows us to study the effects of finite size and quenching rate in the formation of a-Si in great detail. We find that it requires a simulation cell up to $64,000$ atoms (a cubic cell with a linear size of 11 nm) and a quenching rate down to $10^{11}$ K s$^{-1}$ for fully convergent thermal conductivity. Structural properties, including short- and medium-range order as characterized by the pair correlation function, angular distribution function, coordination number, ring statistics and structure factor are studied to demonstrate the accuracy of NEP and to further evaluate the role of quenching rate. Using both the heterogeneous and the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD methods and the related spectral decomposition techniques, we calculate the temperature- and thickness-dependent thermal conductivity values of a-Si and show that they agree well with available experimental results from 10 K to room temperature. Our results also highlight the importance of quantum effects in the calculated thermal conductivity and support the quantum correction method based on the spectral thermal conductivity. ",
