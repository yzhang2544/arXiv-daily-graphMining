The phase of the photoelectron wavepackets is measured by an attosecond interferometric technique, using the 17$^\\mathrm{th}$ harmonic. We perform experiments with angular resolution using a velocity map imaging spectrometer and with high energy resolution using a magnetic bottle electron spectrometer. Our results are compared to calculations using the two-photon random phase approximation with exchange to account for electron correlation effects. We give an interpretation for the multiple $\\pi$-rad phase jumps observed, both at and away from resonance, as well as their dependence on the emission angle. ",

    "abstract": "Hybrid structures formed between organic molecules and inorganic quantum dots can accomplish unique photophysical transformations by taking advantage of their disparate properties. The electronic coupling between these materials is typically weak, leading photoexcited charge carriers to spatially localize to a dot or a molecule at its surface. However, we show that by converting a chemical linker that covalently binds anthracene molecules to silicon quantum dots from a carbon-carbon single bond to a double bond, we access a strong-coupling regime where excited carriers spatially delocalize across both anthracene and silicon. By pushing the system to delocalize, we design a photon upconversion system with a higher efficiency (17.2%) and lower threshold intensity (0.5 W/cm^2) than that of a corresponding weakly-coupled system. Our results show that strong coupling between molecules and nanostructures achieved through targeted linking chemistry provides a new route for tailoring properties in materials for light-driven applications.

Results: CXL induced a significant increase in both the tensile and shear moduli in human cornea. The mean in the paired study (pre- and post-, n=7) of the in-plane Young's modulus, E=3u, increased from 24 MPa to 44 MPa while the out-of-plane shear modulus, G, increased from 175 kPa to 548 kPa. Mechanical tests in a subgroup support CXL-induced cornea moduli changes and generally agree with AuT-OCE. Conclusions: The human cornea is a highly anisotropic material. Non-contact AuT-OCE can monitor changes in the anisotropic elastic properties in human cornea during a CXL procedure and measure its outcome. The out-of-plane shear modulus, G, can be accurately reconstructed at all steps of the CXL procedure. Due to complicated biomechanical changes induced by CXL, accurate reconstruction of Young's modulus, E, using the nearly incompressible transversely isotropic (NITI) model is difficult following treatment. A refined model of CXL cornea will be the focus of future studies. ",

These experiments benefit both from the exquisite read-out and control of the few-body ion systems as well as the many-body aspects, tunable interactions, and ultracold temperatures of the atoms. However, combining the two leads to challenges both in the experimental design and the physics that can be studied. Nevertheless, these systems have provided insights into ion-atom collisions, buffer gas cooling of ions and quantum effects in the ion-atom interaction. This makes them promising candidates for ultracold quantum chemistry studies, creation of cold molecular ions for spectroscopy and precision measurements, and as test beds for quantum simulation of charged impurity physics.

    "abstract": "The intrinsic background count rate of tungsten superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) is low, and the calorimeters using these sensors can resolve the energy of single photons. These facts make the sensors particularly interesting for the background-limited searches of new processes and particles. In this contribution, the intrinsic background of a tungsten TES has been investigated. After excluding other sources (e.g., cosmic muons, thermal background) relevant for the observed background rate of $10^{-4}$~s$^{-1}$ for the detection of photons with a wave length of 1064 nm, we investigate the impact of natural radioactivity. Dedicated measurements using gamma-emitters mounted outside the cryostat have been used to estimate the sensitivity of the TES setup for ionizing radiation. We have found that indeed an increased background can be observed in the presence of the radioactive sources. After selecting events which populate our signal region tuned for single photon detection at near-infrared, roughly 0.5% of the events produced by gamma-rays appear indistinguishable from those due to single photons with 1064~nm wave length. This ratio is consistent with that observed for the residual background detected with the TES at a rate of $10^{-4}$~s$^{-1}$. From this, we conclude that the bulk of the observed background count-rate in the signal region can be explained by natural radioactivity. ",

    "abstract": "Low temperature covalent direct wafer-wafer bonding allows for the fusion of multiple semiconductor wafers without any additional material at the bonding interface. In the context of particle pixel detectors this might provide an alternative to bump-bonding for joining sensors to readout chips. Previous investigations have shown that the amorphous layer formed at the interface during bonding is detrimental to charge propagation. To investigate the influence of the bonding interface on signal collection we have fabricated custom test structures by bonding high-resistivity N to high-resistivity P-type silicon wafers thus forming P-N junctions. Scanning transmission electron microscopy shows indeed the formation of ca. 3nm wide amorphous layer at the interface. Using a scanning transient current technique (TCT) setup we were able to record generated signals. Illuminating our sample with light of different wavelengths and from different sides, indicates that the P side of the bonded structures can be fully depleted, but not the N side. This indicates a strongly asymmetric depletion behaviour which we attribute to the presence of the bonding interface. ",

    "abstract": "The quantum many-body problem lies at the center of the most important open challenges in condensed matter, quantum chemistry, atomic, nuclear, and high-energy physics. While quantum Monte Carlo, when applicable, remains the most powerful numerical technique capable of treating dozens or hundreds of degrees of freedom with high accuracy, it is restricted to models that are not afflicted by the infamous sign problem. A powerful alternative that has emerged in recent years is the use of neural networks as variational estimators for quantum states. In this work, we propose a symmetry-projected variational solution in the form of linear combinations of simple restricted Boltzmann machines. This construction allows one to explore states outside of the original variational manifold and increase the representation power with moderate computational effort. Besides allowing one to restore spatial symmetries, an expansion in terms of Krylov states using a Lanczos recursion offers a solution that can further improve the quantum state accuracy. We illustrate these ideas with an application to the Heisenberg $J_1-J_2$ model on the square lattice, a paradigmatic problem under debate in condensed matter physics, and achieve start-of-the-art accuracy in the representation of the ground state.

Among them, the generalized DEOM needs to be scrutinized and SFD-DEOM has many restrictions in the application. In this article, we combine the traditional DEOM theory with the Fokker-Planck algebra. The resulting Fokker-Planck quantum master equation (FP-QME) is an exact dynamical master equation for open quantum systems and can be directly applied to non-linear system-bath coupling cases. We scrutiny those three methods and the results witness the establishment of the exact theory and numerical method of the open quantum system under quadratic system-bath coupling. ",

The bistability manifests itself in both the mechanical frequency and linewidth under a strong microwave drive field, which simultaneously activates three different kinds of nonlinearities, namely, magnetostriction, magnon self-Kerr, and magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearities. The magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity is first predicted and measured in magnomechanics. The system enters a regime where Kerr-type nonlinearities strongly modify the conventional cavity magnomechanics that possesses only a dispersive magnomechanical coupling. Three different kinds of nonlinearities are identified and distinguished in the experiment. Our work demonstrates a new mechanism for achieving mechanical bistability by combining magnetostriction and Kerr-type nonlinearities, and indicates that such Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanics provides a unique platform for studying many distinct nonlinearities in a single experiment.

    "abstract": "Fluidic devices exhibiting ion current rectification (ICR), or ionic diodes, are of broad interest for applications including desalination, energy harvesting, and sensing, amongst others. For such applications a large conductance is desirable which can be achieved by simultaneously using thin membranes and wide pores. In this paper we demonstrate ICR in micron sized conical channels in a thin silicon membrane with pore diameters comparable to the membrane thickness but both much larger than the electrolyte screening length. We show that for these pores the entrance resistance is not only key to Ohmic conductance around 0 V, but also for understanding ICR, both of which we measure experimentally and capture within a single analytic theoretical framework. The only fit parameter in this theory is the membrane surface potential, for which we find a large value compared to literature. From this excessively large surface potential we infer that surface charge outside the pore strongly contributes to the observed rectification. We experimentally test this hypothesis in a small array of pores and find that ICR vanishes due to outer membrane pore-pore interactions while Ohmic conductance around 0 V remains unaffected. We find that the pore-pore interaction for ICR is set by a long-ranged decay of the concentration which explains the surprising finding that the ICR vanishes for even a sparsely populated array with a pore-pore spacing as large as 7 $\\mu$m.

The actual state of the films during the deposition process, which is influenced by the deposition pressure and the oxidation caused by the residual gases, is not completely known. We report on the YHxOy thin films deposited by reactive pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering. Since the visible light transmittance is closely related to the phase and chemical composition of the films, in-situ transmittance measurements during and after deposition are performed. Ex-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the optical constants of YHxOy throughout the film thickness. In order to obtain metallic YH2-x films, the densest possible structure with a high deposition rate is required, otherwise the films could already be partially transparent during the deposition. The transmittance is higher if deposition pressure is increased. This is because of the oxidation promoted by more porous growth of the microstructure that is observed at the surface and cross-section images of the films. The films exhibit a refractive index gradient perpendicular to the substrate surface, which is related to the porosity and variation of the chemical composition. ",

In seminal work by Lu et al., a measurement to estimate the separation distance of two point sources (with a known centroid) was shown to achieve the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. This work made implicit use of reflection symmetry of the sources. Here we present a framework that uses more general symmetry in a constellation to construct a quantum measurement that achieves the quantum Cramer-Rao bound in estimation of parameters. We show how this technique can be used to estimate parameters simultaneously in symmetric point-source constellations with more than two point sources. In order to use symmetry explicitly, we make use discrete point spread functions in momentum space that maintain this symmetry. This framework allows us to use techniques from quantum computing such as Fourier transforms and linear optical circuits to implement the optimal measurement. To our knowledge, this is first work that shows for more than two point sources achievable quantum limits of estimation and modal transformations. ",
