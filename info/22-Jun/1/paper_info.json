    "abstract": "We report a study of high-order multi-photon absorption, nonlinear refraction, and their anisotropy in four notable mid-infrared \\c{hi}(2) crystals: GaP, ZnSe, GaSe and ZGP using the Z- scan method and 2.35-{\\mu}m femtosecond pulses with peak intensity in excess of 200 GW/cm2. We found that the nonlinear absorption obeys a perturbation model with multi-photon absorption (MPA) orders from N = 4 to 6, in good agreement with the bandgaps of the crystals. A study of the role of free carrier absorption, performed by varying the pulse duration between 30 and 70 fs while maintaining a constant peak intensity showed that at our intensity levels, free carriers generated in the process of MPA absorb much stronger than would be expected from their linear absorption cross section. Possible mechanisms include high-field effects, such as intra-valley scattering in the conduction band and absorption to higher lying bands. Nonlinear refractive indices were measured using (i) closed aperture Z-scan and (ii) spectral broadening due to self-phase modulation, both methods agreeing well with each other. ",

    "abstract": "To date, second-harmonic generation (SHG) at nanoscale has been concentrated on employing high-refractive-index nanostructures, owing to the strong field confinement at deep subwavelength scales based on optically resonant effects. However, low-index nanostructures generally exhibit weaker resonant effects and lower field confinement. To address this issue, by harnessing the large nonlinearity of LiNbO$\\mathrm{_3}$, we propose a novel approach to employ guided resonances and bound states in the continuum (BICs) with a LiNbO$\\mathrm{_3}$ metasurface consisting of a LiNbO$\\mathrm{_3}$ disk array sitting on a LiNbO3 thin film. Such a system can transform the guided modes supported by LiNbO$\\mathrm{_3}$ thin film into high-quality guided resonances which can be excited directly under plane-wave illumination. Importantly, we further demonstrate strong field confinement inside LiNbO3 thin film with tailorable Q-factor by realising a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Such a unique mode engineering enables a record-high SHG efficiency of 5\\% under a pump intensity as low as 0.4 $\\mathrm{MW/cm^{2}}$. Moreover, we reveal the influence of nonlinear resonances and cross-coupling on the SHG by showing the anomalous SHG and efficiency tuning with the rotation of the crystal axis. Our work offers a new route to constructing enhanced SHG based on high-Q guided resonances and BICs, including low-index and high-index nonlinear materials. ",

We compare the frequency response of silicon monovacancies to a radio-frequency magnetic drive via optically-detected magnetic resonance and the resonator's own radio-frequency acoustic drive via optically-detected spin acoustic resonance and observe a narrowing of the spin transition to nearly the linewidth of the driving acoustic resonance. We show that acoustic driving can be used at room temperature to induce coherent population oscillations. Spin acoustic resonance is then leveraged to perform stress metrology of the lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonator, showing for the first time the stress distribution inside a bulk acoustic wave resonator.

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the optical energy absorption of crystalline silicon subject to dual-color femtosecond laser pulses, using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We employ the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange-correlation potential which reproduces the experimental direct band gap energy $E_g$. We consider situations where the one color is in the ultraviolet (UV) range above $E_g$ and the other in the infrared (IR) range below it. The energy deposition is examined as a function of mixing ratio $\\eta$ of the two colors with the total pulse energy conserved. Energy transfer from the laser pulse to the electronic system in silicon is dramatically enhanced by simultaneous dual-color irradiation and maximized at $\\eta\\sim 0.5$. Increased is the number of generated carriers, not the absorbed energy per carrier. The effect is more efficient for lower IR photon energy, or equivalently, larger vector-potential amplitude. As the underlying mechanism is identified the interplay between intraband electron motion in the valence band (before excitation) driven by the IR component and resonant valence-to-conduction interband excitation (carrier injection) induced by the UV component. The former increases excitable electrons which pass through the $k$ points of resonant transitions. The effect of different multiphoton absorption paths or intraband motion of carriers generated in the conduction band play a minor role. ",

As a possible explanation of this, it is considered that the most part of the present universe is filled with a form of energy that exerts a negative pressure called dark energy, which drives the acceleration. In the present work, we assume a dynamical dark energy model, where dark energy interacts with matter and grows at the expense of the latter. Using this model, we discuss the evolution of the universe within the context of loop quantum cosmology. Our work successfully explains the presently observed accelerated expansion of the universe, by predicting that the present universe is phantom dominated. We also found that in the past, the expansion of the universe was decelerated one and transition from deceleration to acceleration would occur at $t_{q=0}=0.688t_0$, where $t_0$ is the present age of the universe. Again, our analysis predicted that at the transition time, the universe would be dominated with quintessence type dark energy. ",

In this paper we analyze the impact of the coherent undulator radiation on the longitudinal single-bunch multi-turn collective dynamics, exploring a new possible instability mechanism. We formulate the multi-turn equations of motion for the single microbunch as two sets of difference equations in the modulator and in the remaining storage ring. The dispersion equation can then be obtained by introduction of the undulator-averaged phase space coordinates. The predicted instability growth rate shows reasonable agreement with the numerical turn-by-turn tracking simulations provided validity of the underlying assumptions. The analysis shall provide some insights for the coherent undulator radiation driven multi-turn instability in the cavity modulator. Differences between such a new instability mechanism and the Robinson instability in a conventional radio-frequency-based storage ring are also discussed. ",

GO films are integrated onto Si3N4 waveguides using a solution-based, transfer-free coating method that enables precise control of the film thickness. Detailed SPM measurements are carried out using both picosecond and femtosecond optical pulses. Owing to the high Kerr nonlinearity of GO, the hybrid waveguides show significantly improved spectral broadening compared to the uncoated waveguide, achieving a broadening factor of up to ~3.4 for a device with 2 layers of GO. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we obtain an improvement in the waveguide nonlinear parameter by a factor of up to 18.4 and a Kerr coefficient (n2) of GO that is about 5 orders of magnitude higher than Si3N4. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis for the influence of GO film length, coating position, and its saturable absorption on the SPM performance. These results verify the effectiveness of on-chip integrating 2D GO films to enhance the nonlinear optical performance of Si3N4 devices. ",

Using rigorous electromagnetic theory, we investigate the forces and trapping performance of near-field optical tweezers carrying spin and orbital angular momenta. The trapping field is assumed to be generated by a total internal reflection microscope objective at a glass-water interface in conditions where most of the transmitted light is evanescent. We find novel aspects of these tweezers, including the possibility to rotate and stably trap nanoscopic beads. More importantly, we show that, under near-field conditions, the contributions of of spin and orbital angular momenta to the rotation of small particles are almost equivalent, opening the possibility to cancel each other when they have opposite sign. We show that these conditions result in optimal optical trapping, giving rise to extremely effective optical tweezers for nanomanipulation, having both circular symmetry and relatively weak rotation.

We verify the simulation results even for large ion numbers by engineering low excitations and thus low effective dimensions; then we extend to 32 excitations for an effective dimension of $2^{77}$, which is difficult for classical computers. By regarding the phonon modes as baths, we explore Markovian or non-Markovian spin dynamics in different parameter regimes of the JCH model, similar to quantum emitters in a structured photonic environment.
