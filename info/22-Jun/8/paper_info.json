    "abstract": "Fano resonance observed in various classical and quantum systems features an asymmetric spectral line shape. For designing nanoresonators for monochromatic applications, it is beneficial to describe Fano resonance in non-spectral parametric domains of critical structural parameters. We develop the analytical model of the parametric Fano profile based on a coupled harmonic oscillator (CHO) model and theoretically demonstrate its application in describing the optical response of a chirped waveguided plasmonic crystal (CWPC). The developed parametric Fano model may find applications in the design of monochromatic and spectrometer-free nanodevices. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a physical design of a compact all optical terahertz (THz)-driven electron source. The 300 mm accelerator beamline, powered by Joule level laser system, is easily to be integrated to tabletop scale. A dual-feed THz-driven electron gun with an exponential impedance, a tapered dielectric loaded cylindrical waveguide, THz-driven bunch compressors and permanent magnet solenoids (PMS) have been designed and optimized. Dynamics simulations show that the electron source can deliver a 19 fC, 3 MeV electron beams with a normalized transverse emittance of 0.079 {\\pi}.mm.mrad. A minimum relative energy spread of 0.04% or a minimum root-mean-square bunch length of 6.1 fs can be achieved by adjusting the beam shaping line. Sensitivity analysis shows that the THz-driven electron source can effectively work under a 1.5% energy jitter of the THz power system. Simulated diffraction pattern up to the fourth order of an aluminum sample based on the beamline can be clearly distinguished. A prototype THz gun has beam fabricated and is now under testing, more results will be reported in future works. ",

    "abstract": "Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) has gained much attention recently because of its promise for the development of table-top-size X-ray light sources. Precise and fast simulation is an indispensable tool for predicting the radiation property of a given machine design and to optimize its parameters. Instead of the conventional approach to compute radiation spectra which directly evaluates the discretized Fourier integral of the Li\\'enard-Wiechert field given analytically (referred to as the frequency-domain method), this article focuses on an approach where the field is recorded along the observer time on a uniform time grid which is then used to compute the radiation spectra after completion of the simulation, referred to as the time-domain method. Besides the derivation and implementation details of the proposed method, we analyze possible parallelization schemes and compare the parallel performance of the proposed time-domain method with the frequency-domain method. We will characterize scenarios/conditions under which one method is expected to outperform the other. ",

Here we show the generation of 58.4 nm laser by a single-photon-excitation related stimulated anti-Stokes Raman scattering (ASRS) with an efficiency higher than that of high harmonic generation (HHG). Utilizing microwave excited helium in the metastable 1s2s state irradiated by a resonant femto-second 2058 nm laser, we obtain pulsed 58.4 nm laser with a divergence of 1.9 mrad, suggesting its coherent character. The pulse decay time of 426 ps shorter than the lifetime of spontaneous emission also shows its stimulated property. Our results show an applicable path towards up-conversion by single-photon process to generate intense laser with wavelength shorter than 58.4 nm. ",

While this method is well known, the impact of third order dispersion (TOD) on DSR is yet to be fully addressed in the literature. In this article, the impact of TOD on DSR is numerically investigated under the frame of the complex cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation (CQGLE). Our numerical investigations indicate that DSR can stably exist under TOD with nearly the same pulse amplitude, but with a (significantly) different pulse duration. Depending on the value of chromatic dispersion, the pulse duration can be notably longer or shorter due to the presence of TOD. The TOD effect also alters the dependence of pulse duration on the nonlinear gain. Another impact of TOD on DSR is that the DSR exists with an asymmetric pulse profile, leading to steepening of one edge of the DSR pulse, while flattening of the other. Our results indicate that TOD has a critical role for realizing DSR in mode-locked lasers and it should be taken into consideration during design and development of DSR-based lasers. ",

Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency second-order nonlinear processes in SiN photonics platform by integrating a few-layer GaSe flake on a SiN microring resonator. With the pump of microwatts continuous-wave lasers, second-harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation with the conversion efficiencies of 849%/W and 123%/W, respectively, are achieved, which benefit from the ultrahigh second-order nonlinear susceptibility of GaSe, resonance enhanced GaSe-light interaction, and phase-matching condition satisfied by the mode engineering. Combining with the easy integration, the GaSe-assisted high-efficiency second-order nonlinear processes offer a new route to enriching already strong functionality of SiN photonics platform in nonlinear optics.

Here, we report, for the very first time, a whole family of high-order IPM forces for not only magnetoelectric but also generic Mie particles, assisted with their excited higher multipoles within. Such optomechanical phenomena derive from a nonlinear contribution of the IPM to the optical force, and can be remarkable even when the incident IPM is small. We observe the high-order optomechanics in a structured light beam with vortex-like IPM streamlines, which allows the low-order dipolar contribution to be suppressed. Our results provide the first unambiguous evidence of the ponderomotive nature of the IPM, expand the classification of optical forces and open new possibilities for optical forces and micromanipulations.

Recently, free-running ring quantum cascade lasers allowed generation of new frequency comb states induced by phase turbulence. In absence of efficient light outcoupling, ring quantum cascade lasers are not suited for applications as they are limited in their power output to microwatt levels. Here we demonstrate electrically pumped ring quantum cascade lasers with integrated active directional couplers. These devices generate self-starting frequency combs and have output power above ten milliwatts at room temperature. We study the transmission of the ring-waveguide resonator system below the lasing threshold, which reveals the ability to individually control the mode indices in the coupled resonators, their quality factors, and the coupling coefficient. When the ring resonator is pumped above the lasing threshold, the intracavity unidirectional single-mode field parametrically amplifies an externally injected signal tuned into one of the ring resonances, generating an idler sideband via four-wave mixing. The ability to inject external optical signals into integrated laser cavities brings into reach coherent control of frequency comb states in ring semiconductor lasers. Furthermore, tunable coupled active resonators pumped below the lasing threshold enable a versatile platform for the studies of resonant electromagnetic effects, ranging from strong coupling to parity-time symmetry breaking.

We here propose to use a transverse electric optical near field extended on nanostructures to efficiently induce spin flips of an adjacent electron beam, exploiting the strong inelastic electron scattering in phase-matched optical near fields. Our calculations show that, using a dramatically reduced laser intensity ($\\sim 10^{12}\\,$W/cm$^2$) and for a short interaction length ($16\\,\\mu$m), an electron spin-flip probability of approximately $12\\%$ can be achieved. More intriguingly, for an unpolarized incident electron beam, its two spin components, parallel and antiparallel to the electric field, are spin-flipped and inelastically scattered to different energy states, providing an analog of the Stern-Galarch experiment in the energy dimension. Our findings are important for optical control of free-electron spins, preparing spin-polarized electron beams, and applications as varied as in material science and high-energy physics. ",

Moreover, we find that the heat current is nonlinear and asymmetric respect to the sign of bias voltage for all of the site energies of quantum dots. Analyses show that the heat current can be positive or negative for all of the site energies and becomes zero for the nonzero voltages.
