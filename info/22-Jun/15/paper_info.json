    "abstract": "Radioactive contaminants on the surfaces of detector components can be a problematic source of background events for physics experiments searching for rare processes. Exposure to radon is a specific concern because it can result in the relatively long-lived $^{210}$Pb (and progeny) being implanted to significant subsurface depths such that removal is challenging. In this article we present results from a broad exploration of cleaning treatments to remove implanted $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po contamination from silicon, which is an important material used in several rare-event searches. We demonstrate for the first time that heat treatments (\"baking\") can effectively mitigate such surface contamination, with the results of a 1200 $^{\\circ}$C bake consistent with perfect removal. We also report results using wet-chemistry and plasma-based methods, which show that etching can be highly effective provided the etch depth is sufficiently aggressive. Our survey of cleaning methods suggests consideration of multiple approaches during the different phases of detector construction to enable greater flexibility for efficient removal of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po surface contamination ",

The scattering coefficients are computed in the low frequency limit using the sealed pore boundary conditions. Also in this limit, using explicit Waterman-Truell (WT) formulas and a generalization of the Linton-Martin (LM) formula to poro-elastic medium, expressions of the wave numbers of the coherent waves are proposed. Expressions of the effective mass densities and moduli are derived from the WT formulas. The effective properties of the coherent wave in an elastic medium are obtained as a limiting case when the porosity tends towards zero. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal Kerr cavity solitons are pulses of light that can persist in coherently-driven, dispersive resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearity. It is widely accepted that such solitons react to parameter inhomogeneities by experiencing a temporal drift whose rate is governed by the gradient of the parameter at the soliton's position. This result, however, assumes that the gradient of the inhomogeneity is constant across the soliton, which may not hold true under all situations, e.g. when using bichromatic driving or in the presence of third-order dispersion that gives rise to an extended dispersive wave tail. Here we report on theoretical and numerical results pertaining to the behavior of dissipative temporal Kerr cavity solitons under conditions where parameter inhomogeneities vary nonlinearly across the width of the soliton. In this case, the soliton velocity is dictated by the full overlap between its so-called neutral mode and the parameter perturbation, which we show can yield dynamics that are manifestly at odds with the common wisdom of motion dependent solely upon the gradient of the inhomogeneity. We also investigate how the presence of third-order dispersion and the associated dispersive wave tail changes the motion induced by parameter inhomogeneities. We find that the dispersive wave tail as such does not contribute to the soliton motion; instead, higher-order dispersion yields counter-intuitive influences on the soliton motion. Our results provide new insights to the behavior of temporal cavity solitons in the presence of parameter inhomogeneities, and can impact systems employing pulsed or bichromatic pumping and/or resonators with non-negligible higher-order dispersion.

Such devices can be straightforwardly realized in state-of-the-art integrated photonics platforms. The mechanism underlying optical isolation is based on the breaking of optical reciprocity induced by the asymmetric action of four-wave mixing processes coupling a strong propagating pump field with co-propagating signal/idler modes but not with reverse-propagating ones. Taking advantage of a close analogy with fluids of light, our proposed isolation mechanism is physically understood in terms of the Bogoliubov dispersion of collective excitations on top of the strong pump beam. A few most relevant set-ups realizing our proposal are specifically investigated, such as a coherently illuminated passive ring resonator and unidirectionally lasing ring or Taiji resonators. ",

While many interesting schemes relying on optical injection have been proposed, the nonlinear mode coupling between different modes of a multi-wavelength laser and their dynamical behavior under optical injection remains vastly unexplored. Here, we experimentally and numerically study the effect of optical injection around the suppressed mode of a dual12 wavelength laser and the resulting interactions with the dominant mode. We highlight a wavelength shift of the dominant mode triggered by injection locking of the suppressed mode and report a strong impact of the mode suppression ratio on the locking range. Finally, we show numerically that the cross-coupling parameter between the two modes might have a key role in this effect. ",

We find parasitic multiple-quantum coherence signals as a consequence of the arbitrary time ordering during the temporal pulse overlap.

The resonant scanner operates at frequencies in excess of 140 kHz, generating scan angles of 10{\\deg} and 6{\\deg} for two orthogonal movement modes with 40 V actuation. On-chip frequency tuning is achieved through electrothermal actuators fabricated adjacent to the mirror main suspension. The electrothermal actuators produce a global and local temperature increase which changes the suspension stiffness and therefore the resonant frequency. A resonance frequency tuning range of up to 5.5 kHz is achieved, with tuning dominant on only one of the two orthogonal scan movement modes. This opens the possibility for precise tuning of a 2D Lissajous scan pattern using a single resonant MEMS scanner with dual orthogonal resonant modes producing full frame update rates up to 20 kHz while retaining the full angular range of both resonant movement modes ",

Plasmonic superlattices have shown the ability to host collective resonances in the mid-infrared, but require stringent fabrication processes to create well-ordered structures.

The resulting molecule-plasmon system approaches vibrational strong coupling, and displays giant Fano dip strengths, SEIRA enhancement factors ~10$^6$, light-matter coupling strengths g~100 cm$^{-1}$, Purcell factors ~10$^6$, and mode volume compression factors ~10$^8$. The collective plasmon-polariton mode is highly robust to nanoparticle vacancy disorder and is sustained by the consistent gap size defined by the molecular spacer. Structural disorder efficiently couples light into the gaps between the multilayers and mirror, enabling Raman and infrared sensing of sub-picolitre sample volumes. ",

Additionally, with recent demonstrations of anti-hydrogen trapping and spectroscopy, a new line of investigation is possible whereby hydrogen can be compared to its antimatter counterpart. The next generation of precision hydrogen spectroscopy will likely require additional motional control of the atomic sample - similar to what is possible with heavier elements. Unfortunately, laser cooling - one of the cornerstones of modern precision atomic physics - is difficult in hydrogen due to the vacuum ultraviolet radiation required. Here, we sidestep the challenges inherent in laser cooling and demonstrate a technique whereby we load metastable atoms from a cryogenic beam into a moving optical lattice, decelerate the lattice, and observe a commensurate deceleration of the atoms. Since the optical lattice is governed by standard optoelectronics, this technique represents a robust platform for the motional control of hydrogen. Our technique could enable greater precision in hydrogen spectroscopy and be transferred to exotic simple atoms such as antihydrogen. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect single photons has become increasingly essential due to the rise of photon-based quantum computing. In this theoretical work, we propose a system consisting of a degenerate two-state quantum dot (QD) side-coupled to a superconducting nanowire. The coupling opens a gap in both the QD mode and the Majorana zero mode at the nanowire edge, enabling photon absorption in the system. We show that the absorbed photoelectron decays via rapid (sub-nanosecond to nanosecond) nonradiative heat transfer to the nanowire phonon modes rather than by spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we calculate the temperature increase and associated resistance increase induced by the absorption of a photon for a given appropriate set of material and environmental parameters, yielding a temperature increase in the millikelvin range and a resistance increase in the kiloohm range, vastly exceeding the photon-absorption-induced temperature and resistance increases for competing 2D-3D hybrid systems by 5 and 9 orders of magnitude, respectively. Lastly, we determine the detector efficiency and discuss the system density required for deterministic photon number measurement, demonstrating that a photon absorption probability of over 99 percent can be achieved for an integrated system consisting of an array of nanowire-QD complexes on-chip inside a cavity. Our results thus provide a basis for a deterministic microwave photon number detector with an unprecedented photon-number-detection resolution. ",
