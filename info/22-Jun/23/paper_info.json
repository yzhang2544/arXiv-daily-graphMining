    "abstract": "We report parametric gain by utilizing $ \\chi^{(2)} $ non-linearities in a semiconductor Bragg Reflection Waveguide (BRW) waveguide chip. Under the two-mode degenerate type II phase matching, it can be shown that more than 18 dBs of parametric gain for both TE and TM modes is tenable in 100s of micrometers of device length. Polarization insensitive parametric gain can be attained within the 1550 nm region of the spectrum. These AlGaAs BRW waveguides exhibit sub-photon per pulse sensitivity. This is in sharp contrast to other types of parametric gain devices which utilize $ \\chi^{(3)} $, where the pump wavelength is in the vicinity of the signal wavelength. This sensitivity, which reached 0.1~photon/pulse, can usher a new era for on-chip quantum information processing using compact, micrometer-scale devices. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of interest in the study of quantum emitters has recently prompted many research groups to construct their own confocal epifluorescence microscopy/spectroscopy instruments. The low light levels typically involved in quantum emitter measurements makes it critically important to account for any potential sources of background fluorescence by components used within such setups. In this report, we show that emission originating from various microscope objectives can possess elusive sharp linewidths that could potentially be mistaken for quantum emission. Impurities present in many glasses overlap in wavelength with single photon emission from several candidate emitter systems of current interest. A careful consideration of this system noise could be critical to exploratory work of the optical properties of materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride. ",

Despite significant advances towards such a goal, achieving lifetime-limited quantum light emission in h-BN has proven to be challenging, primarily due to various broadening mechanisms including spectral diffusion. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate suppression of spectral diffusion by applying an electrostatic field. We observe both Stark shift tuning of the resonant emission wavelength, and emission linewidth reduction nearly to the homogeneously broadened lifetime limit. Lastly, we find a cubic dependence of the linewidth with respect to temperature at the homogeneous broadening regime. Our results suggest that field tuning in electrostatically gated heterostructures is promising as an approach to control the emission characteristics of h-BN color centers, removing spectral diffusion and providing the energy tunability necessary for integrate of quantum light emission in nanophotonic architectures.

We propose an analogic Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model that explains the origin of such low frequency resonances. We further explore low frequency filtering effect with full wave finite element simulations. Our numerical results confirm the bending nature of fundamental resonances of the menhirs and further suggest additional resonances of rotational and longitudinal nature in the frequency range 25 to 50 Hz. Our study thus paves the way for large scale seismic metasurfaces consisting of granite stones periodically arranged atop a thin layer of regolith over a bedrock, for ground vibration mitigation in earthquake engineering.

For the moderate collision energies considered ($E_{\\rm c} = 0.001$ to 0.4 eV, corresponding to a range from 10 K to 4600 K) the total reaction probabilities from the two different treatments of the nuclear dynamics agree very favourably. The undulations present in $P(E)$ from the quantum mechanical treatment can be related to stabilization of the intermediate CO$_2$ complex with lifetimes of on the 0.05 ps time scale. This is also confirmed from direct analysis of the QCT trajectories. Product diatom vibrational and rotational level resolved state-to-state reaction probabilities from TDWP and QCT simulations also agree well except for the highest product vibrational states $(v' \\geq 15)$ and for the lowest product rotational states $(j' \\leq 10)$. Opening of the product vibrational level CO$(v' = 17)$ requires $\\sim 0.2$ eV from QCT and TDWP simulations with O$_2$($j=0$) and decreases to 0.04 eV if all initial rotational states are included in the QCT analysis, compared with $E_{\\rm c} > 0.04$ eV obtained from experiments.

    "abstract": "At the onset of quantum mechanics, it was argued that the new theory would entail a rejection of classical logic. The main arguments to support this claim come from the non-commutativity of quantum observables, which allegedly would generate a non-distributive lattice of propositions, and from quantum superpositions, which would entail new rules for quantum disjunctions. While the quantum logic program is not as popular as it once was, a crucial question remains unsettled: what is the relationship between the logical structures of classical and quantum mechanics? In this essay we answer this question by showing that the original arguments promoting quantum logic contain serious flaws, and that quantum theory does satisfy the classical distributivity law once the full meaning of quantum propositions is properly taken into account. Moreover, we show that quantum mechanics can generate a distributive lattice of propositions, which, unlike the one of quantum logic, includes statements about expectation values which are of undoubtable physical interest. Lastly, we show that the lattice of statistical propositions in classical mechanics follows the same structure, yielding an analogue non-commutative sublattice of classical propositions. This fact entails that the purported difference between classical and quantum logic stems from a misconstructed parallel between the two theories. ",

    "abstract": "Numerical and analytic results have been used to characterize quantum transport in spin chains, showing the existence of both ballistic and diffusive motion. Experiments have shown that heat transfer is surprisingly always diffusive. The scattering from phonons and impurities have been postulated to be the two factors critical in causing the diffusive transport. In this work, we evaluate the transport process by incorporating a bath of phonons and impurities in order to understand the role played by each of the factors. While methods like time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) can be used to simulate isolated spin chains, the coupling with phonons make simulations significantly more challenging. The recently developed multisite tensor network path integral (MS-TNPI) method builds a framework for simulating the dynamics in extended open quantum systems by combining ideas from tDMRG and Feynman-Vernon influence functional. This MS-TNPI is used to characterize dynamics in open, extended quantum systems. Simulations are done with the commonly used sub-Ohmic, Ohmic and super-Ohmic spectral densities describing the phononic bath. We show that while the dynamics in presence of impurities is dependent on the specifics of the interactions, in presence of a bath, the transport is always diffusive, irrespective of the parameters characterizing the bath.

In the context of the motional state of massive resonators, this enables studying fundamental physics at the elusive quantum-classical transition, and measuring force and acceleration with enhanced sensitivity. Laser cooling has been a method of choice to prepare mechanical resonators in the quantum ground state, one of the simplest pure states. However, in order to overcome the heating and decoherence by the thermal bath, this usually has to be combined with cryogenic cooling. Here, we laser-cool an ultracoherent, soft-clamped mechanical resonator close to the quantum ground state directly from room temperature. To this end, we implement the versatile membrane-in-the-middle setup with one fiber mirror and one phononic crystal mirror, which reaches a quantum cooperativity close to unity already at room temperature. We furthermore introduce a powerful combination of coherent and measurement-based quantum control techniques, which allows us to overcome thermal intermodulation noise. The lowest occupancy we reach is 20 phonons, limited by detection efficiency. Doing away with the necessity for cryogenic cooling should further facilitate the spread of optomechanical quantum technologies. ",
