    "abstract": "Integrated photonics capable of incorporating rare earth ions with high optical coherence is desirable for realizing efficient quantum transducers, compact quantum memories, and hybrid quantum systems. Here we describe a photonic platform based on the SmartCut erbium-doped lithium niobate thin film, and explore its stable optical transitions at telecom wavelength in a dilution refrigerator. Optical coherence time of up to 180\\,$\\mu$s, rivaling the value of bulk crystals, is achieved in optical ridge waveguides and ring resonators. With this integrated platform, we demonstrate tunable light-ion interaction and flexible control of optical thickness by exploiting long waveguides, whose lengths are in principle variable. This unique ability to obtain high optical density using a low concentration ions further leads to the observation of multi-echo pulse trains in centimeter-long waveguides. Our results establish a promising photonic platform for quantum information processing with rare earth ions. ",

Our approach rapidly produces computer-generated holograms (CGHs) to precisely control the positions and the intensities of the foci. This is achieved by replacing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) operation in the conventional iterative Fourier-transform algorithm (IFTA) with a linear algebra one, identifying/removing zero elements from the matrices, and employing a generalized weighting strategy. On the premise of accelerating the calculation speed by >70 times, we demonstrate OFA with 99% intensity precision in the experiment. Our method proves effective and is applicable for the systems in which real-time OFA generation is essential. ",

    "abstract": "Degeneracy is an omnipresent phenomenon in various physical systems, which has its roots in the preservation of geometrical symmetry. In electronic and photonic crystal systems, very often this degeneracy can be broken by virtue of strong interactions between photonic modes of the same energy, where the level repulsion and the hybridization between modes causes the emergence of photonic bandgaps. However, most often this phenomenon does not lead to a complete and inverted bandgap formation over the entire Brillouin zone. Here, by systematically breaking the symmetry of a two-dimensional square photonic crystal, we investigate the formation of Dirac points, line node singularities, and inverted bandgaps. The formation of this complete bandgap is due to the level repulsion between degenerate modes along the line nodes of a semimetal-like photonic crystal, over the entire Brillouin zone. Our numerical experimentations are performed by a home-build numerical framework based on a multigrid finite element method. The developed numerical toolbox and our observations pave the way towards designing complete bandgap photonic crystals and exploring the role of symmetry on the optical behaviour of even more complicated orders in photonic crystal systems.

    "abstract": "Nonlinearities in lattices with topological band structures can induce topological interfaces in the bulk of structures and give rise to bulk solitons in the topological bandgaps. Here we study a photonic Chern insulator with saturable nonlinearity and show the existence of bulk solitons. The fundamental bulk solitons exhibit as semi-vortex solitons, where only one pseudospin component has a nonzero vorticity. The bulk solitons are chiral since they have equal angular momentum at different valleys. This phenomenon is direct evidence of the topology of the linear host lattice and the chirality can be changed by switching the sign of the nonlinearity. The bulk solitons bifurcate from the linear bulk band edge and terminate when their powers saturate. We find that these bulk solitons are stable within the whole spectrum range. Moreover, these bulk solitons are robust against lattice disorders both from on-site energies and hopping amplitudes. Our work extends the study of Chern insulators into the nonlinear regime and highlights the interplay between topology and nonlinearity. ",

    "abstract": "In polaritons, the properties of matter are modified by mixing the molecular transitions with light modes inside a cavity. Resultant hybrid light-matter states exhibit energy level shifts, are delocalized over many molecular units and have a different excited-state potential energy landscape which leads to modified exciton dynamics. Previously, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians have been derived to describe the excited states of molecules coupled to surface plasmons (i.e. plexcitons), and these operators have been successfully used in the description of linear and third order optical response. In this article, we rigorously derive non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the response function formalism of nonlinear spectroscopy by means of Feshbach operators, and apply them to explore spectroscopic signatures of plexcitons. In particular we analyze the optical response below and above the exceptional point that arises for matching transition energies for plasmon and molecular components, and study their decomposition using double-sided Feynman diagrams. We find a clear distinction between interference and Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy, and a qualitative change in the symmetry of the lineshape when crossing the exceptional point for third-order signals. This change of symmetry of the nonlinear signal corresponds to a change in the symmetry of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. Our work presents an approach novel methodology for simulating the optical response of sublevels within an electronic system, and opens new applications of nonlinear spectroscopy to examine the different regimes of the spectrum of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

For bulk shear waves, the lateral resolution of the reconstructed modulus map (i.e., elastographic resolution) can approach optical coherence tomography (OCT) capabilities, typically a few tens of microns. Here we perform comprehensive numerical simulations and acoustic micro-tapping OCE experiments to show that for the typical situation of guided wave propagation in bounded media, such as cornea, the elastographic resolution cannot reach the OCT resolution and is mainly defined by the thickness of the bounded tissue layer. We considered the excitation of both broadband and quasi-harmonic guided waves in a bounded, isotropic medium. Leveraging the properties of broadband pulses, a robust method for modulus reconstruction with minimum artifacts at interfaces is demonstrated. In contrast, tissue bounding creates large instabilities in the phase of harmonic waves, leading to serious artifacts in modulus reconstructions. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new parametrization of the AMOEBA polarizable force field for water denoted Q-AMOEBA, for use in simulations that explicitly account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). This study is made possible thanks to the recently introduced adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath (adQTB) simulation technique which computational cost is comparable to classical molecular dynamics. The flexible Q-AMOEBA model conserves the initial AMOEBA functional form, with an intermolecular potential including an atomic multipole description of electrostatic interactions (up to quadrupole), a polarization contribution based on the Thole interaction model and a buffered 14-7 potential to model van der Waals interactions. It has been obtained by using a Force Balance fitting strategy including high-level quantum chemistry reference energies and selected condensed phase properties targets. The final Q-AMOEBA model is shown to accurately reproduce both gas phase and condensed phase properties, notably improving the original AMOEBA water model. This development allows the fine study of NQEs on water liquid phase properties such as the average H-O-H angle compared to its gas phase equilibrium value, isotope effects etc... Q-AMOEBA also provides improved infrared spectroscopy prediction capabilities compared to AMOEBA03. Overall, we show that the impact of NQEs depends on the underlying model functional form and on the associated strength of hydrogen bonds. Since adQTB simulations can be performed at near classical computational cost using the Tinker-HP package, Q-AMOEBA can be extended to organic molecules, proteins and nucleic acids opening the possibility for the large scale study of the importance of NQEs in biophysics.

As was demonstrated before, such diffusion effect is equivalent to a spatial low-pass filter attenuating the high spatial frequency (SF) components of the optical field. Here, employing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) based light storage in hot atomic vapor, we demonstrate that the angular deviation between the control and probe beams could be utilized as a degree of freedom to modulate the SF of the probe beam. The principle is to change the diffusion-induced low-pass filter into a band-pass filter, whose SF response can be tuned by varying the direction and magnitude of the angular deviation. Transverse multimode light fields, such as optical images and Laguerre-Gaussian modes are utilized to study such SF modulation. Our findings could be broadly applied to the fields of quantum information processing, all-optical image manipulation and imaging through diffusive media. ",

We consider both the symmetric system with equal intra-species scattering lengths and atomic masses, modeled by a single (scalar) LHY-corrected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), and the general asymmetric case with different intra-species scattering lengths, described by two coupled (spinor) GPEs. We found that in the symmetric setting, 1D and 2D holes can exist in a stable form within a range of chemical potentials that overlaps with that of self-bound quantum droplets, but that extends far beyond it. In this case, holes are found to be stable in 1D and they transform into pairs of stable out-of-phase kinks at the critical chemical potential at which localized droplets turn into flat-top states, thereby revealing the connection between localized and extended nonlinear states. In contrast, spinor nature of the asymmetric systems may lead to instability of 1D holes, which tend to break into two gray states moving in the opposite directions. Such instability arises due to spinor nature of the system and it affects only holes nested in extended modulationally-stable backgrounds, while localized quantum droplet families remain completely stable, even in the asymmetric case, while 1D holes remain stable only close to the point where they transform into pairs of kinks. We also found that symmetric systems allow fully stable 2D vortex-carrying single-charge states at moderate amplitudes, while unconventional instabilities appear also at high amplitudes. Symmetry also strongly inhibits instabilities for double-charge vortex-holes, which thus exhibit unexpectedly robust evolutions at low amplitudes. ",

The $^4$H $J^\\pi=1^-$ resonance emerges as a consequence of a contact interaction and discrete scale invariance. Results are extracted with three numerical techniques: trapping the system in a harmonic oscillator trap, solving the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations in configuration space, and using an effective two-body cluster approach. The renormalization of the theory for the relevant amplitudes is assessed in a cutoff-regulator range between $1\\,\\text{fm}^{-1}$ and $10\\,\\text{fm}^{-1}$. Most remarkably, we find a cutoff-stable/RG-invariant resonance in the $^4$H $J^\\pi=1^-$ system. This $p$-wave resonance is thus a universal consequence of the unitary deuteron system and an ensuing discretely scale invariant three-body system with a scale set by the triton binding energy. The stabilization of a resonant state in a few-fermion system solely through pure contact interactions has a significant consequence for the powercounting of the pionless theory. Specifically, the existence of a resonance implies that the known inability of the theory's leading order to bind larger nuclei like 16-oxygen, can be cured by perturbative insertion of sub-leading orders.
