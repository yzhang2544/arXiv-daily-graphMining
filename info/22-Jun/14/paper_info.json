    "abstract": "A lightsail can be accelerated to ultra-high speed by the radiation pressure of a laser having an intensity of the order of GW/m$^2$, which though presents a critical challenge in the thermal management of lightsails. In this letter, we explore the applicable regimes of solid-state laser cooling in dissipating heat in additional to the previously explored radiative cooling approach. We begin by examining the cooling capacity of laser cooling, and show that the cooling rate from a micron-thick layer doped with ytterbium ions can exceed that of blackbody thermal emission. This allows more intense laser illumination upon material damage, and consequently shortened acceleration distance. Next, we explore the impact of the limited operating bandwidth of laser cooling to account for the Doppler shift of the pumping laser, and conclude that laser cooling is helpful for target velocities $\\lesssim5\\%$ for room-temperature operations.

    "abstract": "In nanoscale photonic devices, the demand for multifunctionality from metasurface 2D optics increases rapidly. To explore fine-tuning in the design metric, we reinvestigated the trapezoid shape copper metasurface with Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulation for efficiently using linearly polarized light for two different functionalities. From the plasmonic band structure, we see how the degree of asymmetry in geometry affects the efficient resonance coupling of the traveling plasmonic modes, along with different types of mode hybridization profiles related to the nanoantenna's geometric shape. Tuning the nanoantenna's length, we can excite the effective plasmon mode supported by this configuration and guide out surface wave unidirectionally from the normal incident free-space light for visible to infrared range. Directed surface plasmon polariton has both antisymmetric and symmetric modes oscillating between the top and bottom surface of the continuous metal layer depending on the nanoantenna's length and wavelength. This proposed Copper metasurface is optimized for far-field application of broadband (600-900 nm) anomalous beam steering for an average of 65 percent efficiency with a maximum of 64 degree angle. This work brings more understanding of how one metasurface can be implemented in small footprint plasmonic devices, waveguide mode controlling, as well as beam steering with their wavelength dependent functionality.

    "abstract": "Raman scattering signal can be enhanced through localization of incident field into sub-wavelength hot-spots through plasmonic nano-structures (Surface-enhanced Raman scattering-SERS). Recently, further enhancement of SERS signal via quantum objects are proposed by [1] without increasing the hot-spot intensity (\\textit{silent-enhancement}) where this suggestion prevents the modification of vibrational modes or the breakdown of molecules. The method utilizes path interference in the non-linear response of Stokes-shifted Raman modes. In this work, we extend this phenomenon to tune the spectral position of \\textit{silent-enhancement} factor where the multiple vibrational modes can be detected with a better signal-to-noise ratio, simultaneously. This can be achieved in two different schemes by employing either (i) graphene structures with quantum emitters or (ii) replacing quantum emitters with graphene spherical nano-shell in \\cite{Postaci2018}. In addition, the latter system is exactly solvable in the steady-state. These suggestions not only preserve conventional non-linear Raman processes but also provide flexibility to enhance (silently) multiple vibrational Raman modes due to the tunable optical properties of graphene.

    "abstract": "The heating of ions via lower hybrid waves has been observed in several astrophysical as well as laboratory plasmas. We have conducted Particle-In-Cell simulations to demonstrate absorption of the incident laser pulse at a chosen localized point in the target by manipulating the plasma density profile. We show that a part of the incident laser propagates inside plasma target, when its frequency lies below the lower hybrid resonance frequency. Thereafter, as it experiences a negative density gradient, it approaches the resonance point where its group velocity approaches zero. This is where the electromagnetic energy prominently gets converted into electrostatic and eventually into kinetic energy of ions. Thus by tailoring the plasma density profile one can have the absorption of incident electromagnetic wave energy at a designated location inside the plasma. This may have importance in various applications where energy deposition/heating of plasma at a localized region is desirable. ",

    "abstract": "The Tangerine project aims to develop new state-of-the-art high-precision silicon detectors. Part of the project has the goal of developing a monolithic active pixel sensor using a novel 65 nm CMOS imaging process, with a small collection electrode. This is the first application of this process in particle physics, and it is of great interest as it allows for an increased logic density and reduced power consumption and material budget compared to other processes. The process is envisioned to be used in for example the next ALICE inner tracker upgrade, and in experiments at the electron-ion collider. The initial goal of the three-year Tangerine project is to develop and test a sensor in a 65 nm CMOS imaging process that can be used in test beam telescopes at DESY, providing excellent spatial resolution and high time resolution, and thus demonstrating the capabilities of the process. The project covers all aspects of sensor R&D, from electronics and sensor design using simulations, to prototype test chip characterisation in labs and at test beams. The sensor design simulations are performed by using a powerful combination of detailed electric field simulations using technology computer-aided design and high-statistics Monte Carlo simulations using the Allpix Squared framework. A first prototype test chip in the process has been designed and produced, and successfully operated and tested both in labs and at test beams. ",

    "abstract": "Resonant optical phased arrays are a promising way to reach fully reconfigurable metasurfaces in the optical and NIR regimes with low energy consumption, low footprint and high reliability. Continuously tunable resonant structures suffer from inherent drawbacks such as low phase range, amplitude-phase correlation or extreme sensitivity that makes precise control at the individual element level very challenging. In order to bypass these issues, we use 1-bit (binary) control for beam steering for an innovative nano-resonator antenna and explore the theoretical capabilities of such phased arrays. A thermally realistic structure based on vanadium dioxide sandwiched in a metal-insulator-metal structure is proposed and optimized using inverse design to enhance its performance at 1550 nm. Continuous beam steering over 90{\\deg} range is successfully achieved using binary control, with excellent agreement with predictions based on the theoretical first principles description of phased arrays. Furthermore a broadband response from 1500 nm to 1700 nm is achieved. The robustness of the design manufacturing imperfections is also demonstrated. This simplified approach can be implemented to optimize tunable nanophotonic phased array metasurfaces based on other materials or phased shifting mechanisms for various functionalities. ",

We develop a theoretical model for the polarization dependence in terms of the transverse dynamics of trapped electrons, resonantly driven by bubble centroid oscillations.

In the model, the polarization dependent jitter originates from shot-to-shot fluctuations of the laser carrier envelope phase. The model is verified by particle in cell simulations and suggests that for non-CEP stabilized systems the polarization dependent jitter may form an ultimate limit to beam pointing stability in LWFAs.

In the framework of the paper we examine a quantum wave associated with a relativistic particle, and it is shown that the group velocity of the wave approaches the speed of light, implying that the particles resonantly exchange energy with EM waves, eventually leading to acceleration of particles to very high energies. For typical parameters of under accreting Eddington radio AGN, it is shown that the resonant energization could catapult particles to extreme energies $\\sim 10^{16-20}$eV. ",

We find that, by appropriately driving the magnon mode and the cavity to simultaneously activate the magnomechanical Stokes and the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering, a stationary optomagnonic entangled state can be created. We further show that, by activating the magnomechanical state-swap interaction and by subsequently sending a weak red-detuned optical pulse to drive the cavity, the magnonic state can be read out in the cavity output field of the pulse via the mechanical transduction. The demonstrated entanglement and state readout protocols in such a novel opto-magnomechanical configuration allow us to optically control, prepare, and read out quantum states of collective spin excitations in solids, and provide promising opportunities for the study of quantum magnonics, macroscopic quantum states, and magnonic quantum information processing.

We employ a bulk-density coincidence to enhanced the imaging signal. Specifically, we introduce a re-scaled image signal, which is immune to background intensity distribution profile of the photon pulse.
