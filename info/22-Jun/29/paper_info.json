    "abstract": "A pulse generation scheme is proposed based on a structured resonance in a cavity where the non-conventional energy distribution is concentrated in its middle part. The cavity is first used as an oscillator during the energy charging step and when a switch is activated the signal is extracted from its center. The key component of the proposed scheme is the periodic microstrip waveguide with a fourth-order degenerate band edge (DBE) of its wavenumber-frequency dispersion diagram. The DBE is an exceptional point degeneracy condition that is responsible for the energy to be localized at the cavity center and that can also have the quality factor easily destroyed by a perturbation. The waveguide is designed to have a DBE frequency of 2.86 GHz and produces pulses of approximately 0.1 V peak and 1.1 ns width. ",

The THz field waveforms are reconstructed in the spatial and temporal domains using multi-shot and single-shot EOS schemes respectively.

    "abstract": "Cells can withstand hostile environmental conditions manifest as large mechanical forces such as pressure gradients and/or shear stresses by dynamically changing their shape. Such conditions are realized in the Schlemm's canal of the eye where endothelial cells that cover the inner vessel wall are subjected to the hydrodynamic pressure gradients exerted by the aqueous humor outflow. These cells form fluid-filled dynamic outpouchings of their basal membrane called \\textit{giant vacuoles}. The inverse of giant vacuoles are reminiscent of cellular blebs, extracellular cytoplasmic protrusions triggered by local temporary disruption of the contractile actomyosin cortex. Inverse blebbing has been first observed experimentally during sprouting angiogenesis, but its underlying physical mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identify giant vacuole formation as inverse blebbing and formulate a biophysical model of this process. Our model elucidates how cell membrane mechanical properties affect the morphology and dynamics of giant vacuoles and predicts coarsening akin to Ostwald ripening between multiple invaginating vacuoles. Our results are in qualitative agreement with observations from the formation of giant vacuoles during perfusion experiments. Our model not only elucidates the biophysical mechanisms driving inverse blebbing and giant vacuole dynamics, but also identifies universal features of the cellular response to pressure loads that are relevant to many experimental contexts.

Here, we show broad spectral tuning of Kerr soliton microcombs in a thermally controlled crystalline microresonator with pump-detuning stabilization. The fundamental elements composing frequency combs, namely the center frequency, repetition frequency, and carrier-envelope offset frequency, are spectrally tuned by up to -48.8 GHz, -5.85 MHz, and -386 MHz, respectively, leveraging thermal effects in ultrahigh-Q crystalline magnesium fluoride resonators. We further demonstrate a 3.4-fold enhancement of soliton comb power resulting from thermal expansion with a temperature change of only 28 K by employing quantitative analyses of the fiber-to-resonator coupling efficiency.

However, efficient light-electron control requires a prolonged interaction between the two beams for cascaded transfer of photon energy and momentum to the freely propagating electrons. Here we report the use of traveling evanescent terahertz waves to achieve velocity matching and thereby high acceleration gradients both in space and in time. With experiment and simulations, we demonstrate attosecond streaking, temporal pulse compression, acceleration and spatial focusing of sub-relativistic electron pulses with a single evanescent-wave element under the control of selected terahertz delays and phases. Based on these results, we propose to use a symmetric arrangement with two evanescent terahertz waves to generate isolated attosecond electron pulses in a beam with realistic parameters. These results establish subluminal terahertz waves as a promising tool for ultrafast electron pulse control. ",

At these ultrahigh frequencies, however, the modulation performances are highly sensitive to the transmission line loss as well as the velocity- and impedance-matching conditions, while precise measurements and modeling of these parameters are often non-trivial. Here we present a systematic investigation of the mmWave-optic modulation performances of thin-film lithium niobate modulators through theoretical modeling, electrical verifications and electro-optic measurements at frequencies up to 325 GHz. Based on our experimentally verified model, we demonstrate thin-film lithium niobate mmWave-optic modulators with a measured 3-dB electro-optic bandwidth of 170 GHz and a 6-dB bandwidth of 295 GHz. The device also shows a low RF half-wave voltage of 7.3 V measured at an ultrahigh modulation frequency of 250 GHz. This work provides a comprehensive guideline for the design and characterization of mmWave-optic modulators and paves the way toward future integrated mmWave photonic systems for beyond-5G communication and radar applications.

MAN reconstructs the scattered field in the basis formed by the quasinormal modes of the resonator and provides a transparent interpretation of the physics. The software is implemented in MATLAB and has been developed over the past ten years. MAN features many toolboxes that illustrate how to use the software for various emblematic computations in nanophotonics.

This fundamental property, called the dissipation anomaly, is sometimes referred to as the zeroth law of turbulence. The question of what happens in the limit of vanishing viscosity (purely hypothetical in classical fluids) acquires a particular physical significance in the context of liquid helium, a quantum fluid which becomes effectively inviscid at low temperatures achievable in the laboratory. By performing numerical simulations and identifying the superfluid Reynolds number, here we show evidence for a superfluid analog to the classical dissipation anomaly. Our numerics indeed show that as the superfluid Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller structures are generated on the quantized vortex lines on which the superfluid vorticity is confined, balancing the effect of weaker and weaker dissipation.

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach to the optimal placement of sensors for the problem of reconstructing geophysical fields from sparse measurements. Our method consists of two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the variability of the physical field as a function of spatial coordinates by approximating its information entropy through the Conditional PixelCNN network. To calculate the entropy, a new ordering of a two-dimensional data array (spiral ordering) is proposed, which makes it possible to obtain the entropy of a physical field simultaneously for several spatial scales. In the second stage, the entropy of the physical field is used to initialize the distribution of optimal sensor locations. This distribution is further optimized with the Concrete Autoencoder architecture with the straight-through gradient estimator and adversarial loss to simultaneously minimize the number of sensors and maximize reconstruction accuracy. Our method scales linearly with data size, unlike commonly used Principal Component Analysis. We demonstrate our method on the two examples: (a) temperature and (b) salinity fields around the Barents Sea and the Svalbard group of islands. For these examples, we compute the reconstruction error of our method and a few baselines. We test our approach against two baselines (1) PCA with QR factorization and (2) climatology. We find out that the obtained optimal sensor locations have clear physical interpretation and correspond to the boundaries between sea currents. ",

    "abstract": "In our previous publication, we discussed the optical properties of multi-layered nanocomposite samples consisting of 300 pairs of an AlOx layer and a Cu layer produced from sputtering atomic layer augmented deposition (SALAD). These samples displayed unusual spectral reflectance that could not be well described via conventional means and could not be explained as an interpolation of the constituent materials. Computational models were then needed to both describe the results that were obtained and to predict the samples' other material properties. This process was approached by using the transfer-matrix method to describe the spectral reflectance based on the constituent materials, and then the dispersion method was used to find the composite index of refraction for the samples. The models successfully described pure Cu but encountered minor difficulties when it came to AlOx, as such, more research is needed to either properly model non-holomorphic materials like AlOx with the current algorithm or to find a better model that can adequately describe both Cu and AlOx. The dispersion model implemented predicts that the samples, composed of many thin film layers of metal and dielectric, would display semiconductor-like behavior. Therefore, this indicates that SALAD's combination of sputtering and ALD permits the generation of novel metal-dielectric based semiconductors. ",

Actually, the quantum antennas,as devices shaping light on thelevel of single quanta,havealreadybecomethe key elements in nanooptics and nanoelectronics. The quantum antennas are actively researched for possible implementations in quantum communications, quantum imaging and sensing,andenergy harvesting. However, the design and optimization of these emitting/receivingdevices arestill rather undevelopedin comparisonwith the well-known methods for conventional radio-frequency antennas. This review provides a discussion of the recent achievements in the concept of the quantum antenna as an open quantum systememitting via interaction with a photonic reservoir. We focuson bridging the gap between quantum antennas and their macroscopic classical analogues. We also discuss the ways of quantum-antennaimplementation for different configurations basedon such materials, as plasmonic metals, carbon nanotubes, and semiconductor quantum dots. ",

    "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging study of sheared granular matter",
    "abstract": "We introduce a Magnetic Resonance Imaging technique to study the geometry of shear zones of soft, low-frictional and hard, frictional granular materials and their mixtures. Hydrogel spheres serve as the soft, low-frictional material component, while mustard seeds represent rigid, frictional grains. Some of the hydrogel spheres are doped with CuSO4 salt to serve as tracers. A split-bottom shear cell is sheared stepwise and the shear profiles are determined from the differences of tomograms after successive shear steps, using Particle Imaging Velocimetry.We find that the shear zone geometry differs considerably between soft grains submersed in water and the same material without the embedding fluid.
