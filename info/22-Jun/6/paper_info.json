    "abstract": "Monolithic integration of quantum dot (QD) gain materials onto Si photonic platforms via direct epitaxial growth is a promising solution for on-chip light sources. Recent developments have demonstrated superior device reliability in blanket hetero-epitaxy of III-V devices on Si at elevated temperatures. Yet, thick, defect management epi designs prevent vertical light coupling from the gain region to the Si-on-Insulator (SOI) waveguides. Here, we demonstrate the first electrically pumped QD lasers grown on a 300 mm patterned (001) Si wafer with a butt-coupled configuration by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Unique growth and fabrication challenges imposed by the template architecture have been resolved, contributing to continuous wave lasing to 60 {\\deg}C and a maximum double-side output power of 126.6 mW at 20 {\\deg}C with a double-side wall plug efficiency of 8.6%. The potential for robust on-chip laser operation and efficient low-loss light coupling to Si photonic circuits makes this heteroepitaxial integration platform on Si promising for scalable and low-cost mass production.

    "abstract": "This review provides a discussion of the current state of research on sp-carbon chains synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid. In recent years, pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) has been widely employed for polyynes synthesis thanks to its flexibility with varying laser parameters, solvents, and targets. This allows the control of sp-carbon chains properties as yield, length, termination and stability. Although many reviews related to PLAL have been published, a comprehensive work reporting the current status and advances related to the synthesis of sp-carbon chains by PLAL is still missing. Here we first review the principle of PLAL and the mechanisms of formation of sp-carbon chains. Then we discuss the role of laser fluence (i.e. energy density), solvent, and target for sp-carbon chains synthesis. Lastly, we report the progress related to the prolonged stability of sp-carbon chains by PLAL encapsulated in polymeric matrices. This review will be a helpful guide for researchers interested in synthesizing sp-carbon chains by PLAL. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning model, inspired from UNet with series of encoder and decoder units with skip connections, for the simulation of microwave-plasma interaction. The microwave propagation characteristics in complex plasma medium pertaining to transmission, absorption and reflection primarily depends on the ratio of electromagnetic (EM) wave frequency and electron plasma frequency, and the plasma density profile. The scattering of a plane EM wave with fixed frequency (1 GHz) and amplitude incident on a plasma medium with different gaussian density profiles (in the range of $1\\times 10^{17}-1\\times 10^{22}{m^{-3}}$) have been considered. The training data associated with microwave-plasma interaction has been generated using 2D-FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) based simulations. The trained deep learning model is then used to reproduce the scattered electric field values for the 1GHz incident microwave on different plasma profiles with error margin of less than 2\\%. We propose a complete deep learning (DL) based pipeline to train, validate and evaluate the model. We compare the results of the network, using various metrics like SSIM index, average percent error and mean square error, with the physical data obtained from well-established FDTD based EM solvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards exploring a DL based approach for the simulation of complex microwave plasma interaction. The deep learning technique proposed in this work is significantly fast as compared to the existing computational techniques, and can be used as a new, prospective and alternative computational approach for investigating microwave-plasma interaction in a real time scenario.

We use a fully three dimensional guided-mode expansion method to efficiently calculate waveguide band dispersion properties and modes, while automatic differentiation is employed to calculate the gradient of objective functions. We present two example improved designs: (i) a topological mode with an accessible group index of approximately 30 and a maximum unidirectional Purcell factor at a chiral point greater then 4.5 representing a nearly 10-fold improvement to the Purcell factor, and (ii) a slow light mode, well away from the Brillouin zone edge with a group index greater then 350 and a maximum unidirectional Purcell factor at a chiral point greater than 45.

    "abstract": "Single-beam super-resolution microscopy, also known as superlinear microscopy, exploits the nonlinear response of fluorescent probes in confocal microscopy. The technique requires no complex purpose-built system, light field modulation, or beam shaping. Here, we present a strategy to enhance spatial resolution of superlinear microscopy by modulating excitation intensity during image acquisition. This modulation induces dynamic optical nonlinearity in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in variations of higher spatial-frequency information in the obtained images. The high-order information can be extracted with a proposed weighted finite difference imaging algorithm from raw fluorescence images, to generate an image with a higher resolution than superlinear microscopy images. We apply this approach to resolve two adjacent nanoparticles within a diffraction-limited area, improving the resolution to 130 nm. This work suggests a new scope for developing dynamic nonlinear fluorescent probes in super-resolution nanoscopy. ",

    "abstract": "Low-loss planar Goubau lines show promising potential for terahertz applications. However, a single-wire waveguide exhibits less design freedom than standard multi-conductor lines, which is a significant constraint for realizing standard components. Existing filters for planar Goubau line lack clear design procedures preventing the synthesis of an arbitrary filter response. In this work, we present a design for a bandpass/bandstop filter for planar Goubau line by periodically loading the line with capacitively coupled {\\lambda}/2 resonators, which can be easily tuned by changing their electrical length. The filter's working principle is explained by a proposed transmission-line model. We designed and fabricated a passband filter centered at 0.9 THz on a 10-{\\mu}m silicon-membrane substrate and compared measurement results between 0.5 THz and 1.1 THz to electromagnetic simulations, showing excellent agreement in both S11 and S21. The measured passband has an insertion loss of 7 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 31 %. Overall, the proposed filter design has good performance while having a simple design procedure. ",

Here we bring STAP into the field of acoustics to design compact couplers and functional metamaterial. The space-varying coupling strengths of acoustic waveguides (WGs) are tailored by means of dressed states in a three-level system, accounting for the desirable acoustic energy transfer among three WGs with short length. We show that the acoustic coupler has one-way feature when loss is introduced into the intermediate WG. More uniquely, when the propagation of acoustic wave is designed to mimic a Hadamard transformation, an acoustic metamaterial can be constructed by arraying several couplers, possessing the beam-splitting function and unidirectional, broadband performances. Our work bridges STAP and the acoustic coupler as well as metamaterial, which may have profound impacts on exploring quantum technologies for promoting advanced acoustic devices. ",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between the left- and right-handed versions of a chiral molecule (enantiomers) is vital, but also inherently difficult. Traditional optical methods using elliptically or circularly polarized light rely on weak linear effects which arise beyond the electric-dipole approximation, posing major limitations for time resolving ultrafast chiral molecular dynamics. Here we show how, by tilting the plane of polarization of an ultrashort burst of intense elliptically polarized light, towards its propagation direction, we can turn the waveform into a highly efficient chiro-optical tool. This \"forward tilting\" can be achieved by focusing the beam tightly, creating structured light which exhibits a nontrivial polarization pattern in space. We demonstrate that our structured field allows us to realize an interferometer for efficient chiral recognition that separates the nonlinear optical response of left- and right-handed molecules in space. Our work provides a simple, yet highly efficient, way of spatially structuring the polarization of light to image molecular chirality, with extreme enantio-efficiency and on ultrafast time scales. ",
