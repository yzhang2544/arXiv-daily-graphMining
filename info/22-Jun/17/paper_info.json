    "abstract": "Magneto-mechanical transmitters offer a compact and low-power solution for the generation of ultra-low frequency (ULF) magnetic signals for through-ground and through-seawater communications. Resonant arrays of smaller magneto-mechanical transmitters are particularly interesting in this context as the physical scaling laws allow for the increase of operating frequency and reduce the power requirements for ULF signal generation. In this work, we introduce a generalized model for accurate prediction of frequency and mode shape in generalized magneto-mechanical resonator arrays (MMRAs) that accounts for near-field magnetic interactions as well as magnetically induced nonlinearity. Using experiments, we demonstrate that our predictive capability is significantly improved compared against simplified dipole approximations. We additionally model the eddy current losses internal to the array and find that they are in agreement with experimental observations. ",

Inflation is usually thought to undermine that relationship by means of a dynamical diluting argument, but this argument has recently been disputed in the form of a 'trans-Planckian censorship' conjecture. Ijjas and Steinhardt [\"Bouncing cosmology made simple\", \"A new kind of cyclic universe\"] implicitly advocate an alternative approach: 'generalized cosmic censorship'. I contrast generalized cosmic censorship with the logic of its namesake: the cosmic censorship conjectures. I also remark on foundational concerns in the program of research beyond the standard model, which would be based on such a principle -- a program I dub 'cosmology done as effective field theory', or the empirical study of an 'effective cosmos'.

Although having been developed rapidly, the demonstrated channels are still limited and also lack instantaneity. Here, holograms and printings, always regarded as two independent information coding domains with totally different principles, are combined together through our proposed angle multiplexing framework, leading to multiplexed printings with hundreds of channels. Based on such approach, we experimentally encode respectively 25 gray scale printings into 25 angles and even 8 gray scale videos into 8 angles with a phase-only spatial light modulator. As a bridge between printings and holograms, our method allows to generate printings combining various holographic methods. Beneficial from this, we demonstrate a gradient metasurface based 324 channel printing which multiplexes angles, polarizations and wavelengths simultaneously. Our work paves the way to flexibly angle-dependent printing display and massively multiplexed encryption systems. ",

However, high-resolution rovibronic spectroscopy has been limited to relatively small and simple systems because translationally and rotationally cold samples have not been prepared in sufficiently large quantities for large and complex systems. In this study, we present high-resolution rovibronic spectroscopy results for large gas-phase molecules, namely, free-base phthalocyanine (FBPc). The findings suggest that buffer-gas cooling was effective for large molecules introduced via laser ablation. Rotationally resolved electronic spectroscopy revealed the structures of ground and excited states and the dynamics of large molecules, such as molecular clustering. These findings also serve as a guide for quantum chemical calculations of large molecules. We believe that our study will help in the molecular design of various chemical and biochemical systems. ",

Enormous progress has been made toward broadband phase-matching for parametric amplification and wide applications. In existing devices of broadband parametric amplification, the power efficiency of conversion is restricted to approximately the energy efficiency, and the desire for the signal power enhancement necessitates additional pulse compression after amplification. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast parametric amplification having an extraordinary power efficiency of 1155%; this allows the generation of intense femtosecond pulses without the need for a pulse stretcher and compressor. Direct femtosecond signal amplification by picosecond pumping is enabled by an ultrafast parametric environment in which the pre-delayed signal of faster speed gradually overtakes and effectively depletes the pump of slower speed as they propagate in a nonlinear crystal. The demonstrated technique should lead to breakthroughs in ultrafast lasers as well as applications. ",

Here, a design with an array of slotted nanocubes is proposed to realize remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) from the centrosymmetric silicon, which takes advantage of enlarged surface second-order nonlinearity, strengthened electric field over the surface of the air-slot, as well as the resonance enhancement by the bound states in the continuum. Compared with that from the array of silicon nanocubes without air-slots, SHG from the slotted nanocube array is improved by more than two orders of magnitude. The experimentally measured SHG efficiency of the silicon slotted nanocube array is high as 1.8*10^-4 W^-1, which is expected to be further engineered by modifying the air-slot geometries.

Up to now, it is hard to analyze the intrinsic spectrum in the high-speed laser dynamics process, especially under the condition of fast wavelength sweeping. In this work, a new method to analyze the laser intrinsic spectrum is proposed with the laser energy decomposition to a series of chirp-frequency signals, which is realized by fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) of the coherently reconstructed laser waveform. The new understanding of the energy distribution of lasers contributes to the accurate characterization of laser dynamical parameters in time-frequency domain. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the time-frequency dynamical process of a commercial wavelength swept laser is tested with different wavelength-scanning speeds, and the most suitable measurement time window width required for the FRFT-based narrowest spectrum is also explored. The proposed analysis method of laser dynamical parameters will promote the understanding of laser dynamics, and benefit for the optical precision measurement applications. ",

    "abstract": "The continual increase in computational power and the improvement of algorithms for particle tracking in the past decade have been making it feasible to track larger amounts of particles in 3D Volumetric Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3D-PTV) experiments. Also, the relatively recent introduction of $15 \\: \\mu m$ Air Filled Soap Bubbles (AFSB) has been facilitating the usage of higher particle densities and hence the improvement of the spatial resolution of such measurements, compared with experiments that use $300 \\: \\mu m $ Hellium-Filled Air Bubbles (HFSB). The trend to conduct 3D-PTV experiments with ever increasing larger volumes or at higher particle densities with smaller particles sets an ever increasing strain on the power of the illumination source and upon the image analysis. On one hand it requires a reliable model to estimate the signal level that is measured on a CMOS detector from a Mie scattering particle. On the other hand it requires also a model for estimating the limiting factors upon the image resolution where a large amount of particles within a volume are mapped into a 2D image. Here, we present a model that estimates numerically the signal level on a CMOS detector from a Mie scattering particle within an arbitrary large volume in a 3D-PTV experiment. The model considers the effect of the depth of field, particle density, Mie factor, laser pulse energy and other optical parameters. Thereafter, we investigate the physical limit of the image resolution depending on the depth of field and the density of point-like particles. Finally, we supply three real lab examples that illustrate how to use the relevant expressions of the models in order to estimate the signal level and the image resolution ",

    "abstract": "Microresonators (MRs) are key components in integrated optics. As a result, the estimation of their energy storage capacity as measured by the quality factor (Q) is crucial. However, in MR with high/ultra-high Q, the surface-wall roughness dominates the intrinsic Q and generates a coupling between counter-propagating modes. This splits the usual sharp single resonance and makes difficult the use of classical methods to assess Q. Here, we theoretically show that an interferometric excitation can be exploited in a Cavity Ring-Down (CRD) method to measure the ultimate Q of a MR. In fact, under suitable conditions, the resonant doublet merges into a single Lorentzian and the time dynamics of the MR assumes the usual behavior of a single-mode resonator unaffected by backscattering. This allows obtaining a typical exponential decay in the charging and discharging time of the MR, and thus, estimating its ultimate Q by measuring the photon lifetime. ",

Based on the hypothesis that the ion density is uniformly distributed in the radial direction, we propose a new model to accurately evaluate the total SODFS for ion microwave clocks. The effectiveness of the model has been verified both in simulation and experiment, especially for ion ensemble with temperature less than 100 mK. We believe that our new model offers advantages in accurately evaluating the SODFS for the ion trap, especially those of laser-cooled ion microwave clocks based on large ion clouds. ",

We use in this endeavour the recently developed stochastic Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree approach within the Monte Carlo wave packet formalism [J.Chem.Phys.156, 094109 (2022)]. The method proved to yield thermalized ensembles of wave packets when intramolecular coupling is weak. To treat strongly coupled systems, new Lindblad dissipative operators are constructed as linear combinations of the system coordinates and associated momenta. These are obtained by an unitary transformation to a normal mode representation, which reduces intermode coupling up to second order. Additionally, we use combinations of generalized raising/lowering operators to enforce the Boltzmann distribution in the dissipation operators, which yield perfect thermalization in the harmonic limit. The two ansatz are tested using a model two-dimensional hamiltonian parameterized to disentangle the effects of intramolecular potential coupling, of strong mode mixing observed in Fermi resonances, and of anharmonicity.

However, the capabilities of the current generation of quantum devices are limited due to noise or errors, and therefore implementation of error mitigation and/or correction techniques is pivotal to reliably process quantum algorithms. In this work, we have performed a comparative analysis of the error mitigation capability of the [[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code (QEC method), duplicate circuit technique, and the Bayesian read-out error mitigation (BREM) approach in the context of proof-of-concept implementations of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for determining the ground state energy of H$_2$ molecule. Based on experiments on IBM quantum device, our results show that the duplicate circuit approach performs superior to the QEC method in the presence of the hardware noise. A significant impact of cross-talk noise was observed when multiple mappings of the duplicate circuit and the QEC method were implemented simultaneously $-$ again the duplicate circuit approach overall performed better than the QEC method. To gain further insights into the performance of the studied error mitigation techniques, we also performed quantum simulations on IBM system with varying strengths of depolarising circuit noise and read-out errors which further supported the main finding of our work that the duplicate circuit offer superior performance towards mitigating of errors when compared to the QEC method. Our work reports a first assessment of the duplicate circuit approach for a quantum algorithm implementation and the documented evidence will pave the way for future scalable implementations of the duplicated circuit techniques for the error-mitigated practical applications of near-term quantum computers.

Among the extensive studies in the past decades, one intriguing debate is the underlined mechanism that governing the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics following photoexcitation. In this study, the temperature dependent photocarrier dynamics in Cd3As2 film has been investigated with time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy. The experimental results demonstrate that photoexcitation results in abrupt increase in THz photoconductivity, and the subsequent relaxation shows a single exponential relaxation for various temperatures and pump fluences. The relaxation time increase from 4.7 ps at 5 K to 7.5 ps at 220 K, while the lifetime remains almost constant of ~7.5 ps with temperature above 220 K. A Rothwarf-Taylor model was employed to fit the temperature dependent relaxation time, and a narrow energy gap of ~35 meV is obtained, which occurs around the Dirac node. Our THz spectroscopy results demonstrate that the photocarrier relaxation in Cd3As2 shows a semiconductor-like behavior, rather than hot carrier scatterings in graphene and most of metals. ",
