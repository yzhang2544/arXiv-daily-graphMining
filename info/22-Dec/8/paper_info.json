    "title": "Optical properties of radially-polarised twisted light",
    "abstract": "We show that, in general, any type of radially-polarised paraxial twisted optical mode carries only an axial total optical angular momentum (AM) ${\\bar {\\cal J}_z}=\\ell{\\cal L}_0$ where $\\ell$ is the winding number and ${\\cal L}_0$ is a constant. This mode, however, is shown to have zero spin angular momentum (SAM), so it is endowed only with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and no SAM. The helicity is found to be proportional to $\\ell$, hence radially-polarised modes display chirality. When applied to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode our treatment leads to a total helicity equal to $(\\ell/|\\ell|){\\cal Q}$, where ${\\cal Q}$ is the action constant. The factor $(\\ell/|\\ell|)=\\pm 1$, depends on the sign, not the magnitude of $\\ell$ and so the result holds for any radially-polarised LG mode however large the magnitude of its winding number $\\ell$ is. The magnitude of the action constant ${\\cal Q}$ and hence the helicity are diminished for all such LG modes of large beam waist $w_0$. ",

    "abstract": "Current theoretical demonstration of the Stimulated Brillouin scattering in waveguides composed of centrosymmetric materials is not applicable to describe the phenomenon in waveguides constituting non-centrosymmetric materials. The SBS in the latter problem, entails mutual coupling of the electric and acoustic waves due to piezoelectricity, and ends up to a different power conversion equation than that in a centrosymmetric material. In this study, we theoretically investigate Brillouin scattering in chip-scale waveguides with non-centrosymmetric material when excited by an Inter-Digital-Transducer. We explain how Brillouin scattering formulated in presence of externally injected acoustic waves, we demonestrate the effect of this external signal reinforcing Stimulated Brillouin scattering. We use the derived power conversion equations to study stimulated Brillouin scattering in a gallium arsenide nonowire. The Stokes amplification due to electromechanically reinforced SBS in this case study can grow several orders of magnitude higher than the values reported for a conventional SBS in a silicon nanowire; This enables reducing the waveguide length from centimeters to few hundred micrometers.

    "abstract": "The Target Absorbers for Neutrals (TANs) represent one of the most radioactive regions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Seven $40$\\,cm long fused silica rods with different dopant specifications, manufactured by Heraeus, were irradiated in one of the TANs located around the ATLAS experiment by the Beam RAte of Neutrals (BRAN) detector group. This campaign took place during the Run 2 p+p data taking, which occurred between 2016 and 2018. This paper reports a complete characterization of optical transmission per unit length of irradiated fused silica materials as a function of wavelength (240 nm - 1500 nm), dose (up to 18 MGy), and level of OH and H$_2$ dopants introduced in the manufacturing process. The dose delivered to the rods was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations performed by the CERN FLUKA team. ",

    "abstract": "Organic light emitting field effect transistors (OLEFETs) with bilayer structures have been studied in order to obtain both current density and brightness by combining high-mobility materials and high emissive materials. These devices however are mainly hole-dominated, which cause the efficiency to degrade significantly at high brightness due to charge imbalance. To overcome this fundamental issue, we introduce a novel interfacial engineering ~2 nm into an organic/inorganic hybrid drain to significantly enhance charge capture. We show that the interfacially engineered device forms a bending electronic structures that further accumulate the injected electrons in the light emitting layer and thus effectively capture more holes. The numerical simulation of our capture model suggests that the Coulombic attractions of high density electrons will dominate when hole current is high. As a result, the effect of imbalanced charge transport is overcome, leading to a nearly constant external quantum efficiency (EQE) over a wide range of operating current, EQE~0.23 % over 3 orders of magnitude of current, 1.2 to 2700 mA/cm2 corresponding to brightness 4 to 7700 cd/m2. The same enhancement is retained after increasing EQE to ~0.51%. Having such tunable brightness with sustained emissive efficiency in an OLEFET will revolutionize the new applications in lighting and display technologies that desire high intensity. ",

Current integrated optical isolators have limited bandwidths due to stringent phase-matching conditions, resonant structures, or material absorption. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-broadband integrated optical isolator in thin-film lithium niobate photonics. We use dynamic standing-wave modulation in a tandem configuration to break Lorentz reciprocity and achieve isolation. We measure an isolation ratio of 15 dB and insertion loss below 0.5 dB for a design wavelength of 1550 nm. In addition, we experimentally show that this isolator can simultaneously operate at visible and telecom wavelengths with comparable performance. Isolation bandwidths ~100 nm can be achieved simultaneously at both visible and telecom wavelengths. Our device's large bandwidth, high flexibility, and real-time tunability can enable novel non-reciprocal functionality on integrated photonic platforms. ",

    "abstract": "We study the role of dark and bright autoionizing states (AIS) in photoionization and high harmonic generation (HHG) using a 1D helium model. This model allows numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation beyond the singe-electron approximation completely taking into account electronic correlation. We find the level structure of the system and the spatial distribution of the electronic density for several states including AIS. Studying the HHG efficiency as a function of the detuning from the resonances with AIS we find the HHG enhancement lines. The shapes of these lines are different from the corresponding Fano lines in the photoelectronic spectra, in agreement with the experimental studies in helium. Moreover, we simulate HHG under the conditions when the fundamental frequency is close to the even-order multiphoton resonance with the dark AIS. We find the enhanced generation of the neighbouring odd harmonics. The details of the enhancement lines for these harmonics can be understood taking into account the temporal delay between the emission of the non-resonant and resonant XUV; this delay is defined by the AIS lifetime. Finally, our simulations show that the HHG enhancement due to the dark and the bright AIS is comparable in the studied system. ",

We introduced an introductory course in quantum computing to undergraduate students and investigated the strengths and difficulties of these students in quantum computing after taking the introductory course. Our goal is to contribute to the improvement of quantum computing education while understanding the topics that the students find easy to comprehend and the topics that are difficult to comprehend. We conducted a series of interviews to identify these strengths and difficulties in the students.

The training dataset with ~460 samples is generated by finite element simulations and the model is experimentally verified using integrated silicon nitride microresonators.

In this work, we explore the possibility of realizing largely nonreciprocal total cross sections for a pair of quantum metasurfaces formed by two parallel periodic arrays of two-level atoms. We show that large nonreciprocal responses can be obtained in such nonlinear systems by controlling the position of the atoms and their transition frequencies, without requiring that the environment in which the atoms are placed is nonreciprocal. We demonstrate the connection of this effect with the population of a slowly-decaying dark state, which is critical to obtain large nonreciprocal responses. ",

    "title": "Controlling photon polarisation with a single quantum dot spin",
    "abstract": "In the framework of optical quantum computing and communications, a major objective consists in building receiving nodes that implement conditional operations on incoming photons, using the interaction with a single stationary qubit. In particular, the quest for scalable nodes motivated the development of cavity-enhanced spin-photon interfaces with solid-state emitters. An important challenge remains, however, to produce a stable, controllable, spin-dependant photon state, in a deterministic way. Here we use a pillar-based high-Q cavity, embedding a singly-charged semiconductor quantum dot, to demonstrate the control of giant polarisation rotations induced by a single electron spin. A complete tomography approach is used to deduce the output polarisation Stokes vector, conditioned by a single spin state. We experimentally demonstrate rotation amplitudes such as $\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\pi$ in the Poincar\\'e sphere, as required for applications based on spin-polarisation mapping and spin-mediated photon-photon gates. In agreement with our modeling, we observe that the environmental noise does not limit the amplitude of the spin-induced rotation, yet slightly degrades the polarisation purity of the output states. We find that the polarisation state of the reflected photons can be manipulated in most of the Poincar\\'e sphere, through controlled spin-induced rotations, thanks to moderate cavity birefringence and limited noise. This control allows the operation of spin-photon interfaces in various configurations, including at zero or low magnetic fields, which ensures compatibility with key protocols for photonic cluster state generation.
