    "abstract": "Impact ionization in silicon devices has been extensively studied and several models for a quantitative description of the impact ionization coefficients have been proposed. We evaluate those models against gain measurements on Low Gain Avalanche diodes (LGADs) and derive new parameterizations for the impact ionization coefficients optimized to describe a large set of experimental data. We present pulsed IR-laser based gain measurements on 5 different types of $50\\mu m$-thick LGADs from two different producers (CNM and HPK) performed in a temperature range from $-15^oC$ to $40^oC$. Detailed TCAD device models are conceived based on SIMS doping profiles measurements and tuning of the device models to measured C-V characteristics. Electric field profiles are extracted from the TCAD simulations and used as input to an optimization procedure (least squares fit) of the impact ionization model parameters to the experimental data. It is demonstrated that the new parameterizations give a good agreement between all measured data and TCAD simulations which is not achieved with the existing models. Finally, we provide an error analysis and compare the obtained values for the electron and hole impact ionization coefficients against existing models. ",

    "abstract": "Topological photonic crystals have received considerable attention for their ability to manipulate and guide light in unique ways. They are typically designed by hand based on careful analysis of their bands and mode profiles, but recent theoretical advances have revealed new and powerful insights into the connection between band symmetry, connectivity, and topology. Here we propose a combined global and local optimization framework that integrates a flexible symmetry-constrained level-set parameterization with standard gradient-free optimization algorithms to optimize topological photonic crystals, a problem setting where the objective function may be highly non-convex and non-continuous. Our framework can be applied to any symmetry-identifiable band topology, and we demonstrate its applicability to several prominent kinds of three-dimensional band topology, namely $\\Gamma$-enforced nodal lines, Weyl points, and Chern insulators. Requiring no prior examples of topological photonic crystals or prior knowledge on the connection between structure and band topology, our approach indicates a path towards the automated discovery of novel topological photonic crystal designs.

Our computer simulations reveal an arbitrarily strong increase of the long-time diffusivity of the gravitactic agent when the external torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift. We provide analytic expressions for the mean-square displacement in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the noisy-driven-pendulum problem. The pronounced maximum in the diffusivity is then rationalized by the vanishing of the lowest eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck equation for the angular motion as the rotational diffusion decreases and the underlying classical bifurcation is approached. A simple harmonic-oscillator picture for the barrier-dominated motion provides a quantitative description for the onset of the resonance while its range of validity is determined by the crossover to a critical-fluctuation-dominated regime.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a new photophysical phenomenon whereby UV/vis excitation of a molecule involving a Franck-Condon (FC) active vibration yields infrared (IR) emission by strong coupling to an optical cavity. The resulting UV/vis-to-IR photonic down conversion process is mediated by vibrational polaritons in the electronic excited state potential. It is shown that the formation of such excited state vibrational polaritons (ESVP) via UV/vis excitation only occurs with molecules having vibrational modes with both a non-zero FC activity and IR activity in the excited state. Density functional theory calculations are shown to effectively identify a candidate molecule, 1-Pyreneacetic acid (PAA), with this property and the dynamics of ESVP are modeled using the truncated Wigner approximation. Overall, this work presents a new avenue of polariton chemistry where excited state dynamics, driven by photoexcitation, are influenced by the formation of vibrational polaritons. Along with this, the photonic down conversion is potentially useful in both the sensing of excited state vibrations and in quantum transduction schemes. ",

The auto-differentiable H\\\"uckel code enabled efficient gradient-based optimization of model parameters tuned for excitation energies and molecular polarizabilities, respectively, based on as few as 100 data points from density functional theory simulations. In particular, the facile computation of the polarizability, a second-order derivative, via auto-differentiation shows the potential of differentiable programming to bypass the need for numeric differentiation or derivation of analytical expressions. Finally, we employ gradient-based optimization of atom identity for inverse design of organic electronic materials with targeted orbital energy gaps and polarizabilities. Optimized structures are obtained after as little as 15 iterations, using standard gradient-based optimization algorithms. ",

We have achieved a 10-spatial-channel multi-mode-multi-core waveguide with total occupying spacing of 6.6 um. The multi-mode waveguides have a close spacing of 400 nm. The proposed scheme has high fabrication tolerance, ultra-large bandwidth and good compatibility to the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. It can be applied to any integration platform, any working waveband and any operating mode, providing a universal solution for high-density photonic circuits. ",

Previous studies have shown enhanced ion heating at interfaces, but at the cost of large temperature gradients. Here, we study multi-layered targets to spread this enhanced interface heating to the entirety of the target and find heating parameters at which the temperature distribution is more homogeneous than at a single interface while still exceeding the mean temperature of a non-layered target. Further, we identify a pressure oscillation that causes the layers to alternate between expanding and being compressed with non beneficial effect on the heating. Based on that, we derive an analytical model estimating the oscillation period to find target conditions that optimize heating and temperature homogeneity. This model can also be used to infer the plasma temperature from the oscillation period which can be measured e.g. by XFEL probing. ",

At a temperature of -20C, The readout noise is 1.6 e, the dark current is 0.5 e/pixel/s, and the energy resolution reaches 204.6 eV for single-pixel events. The effect of depletion depth on the sensor's performance was also examined, using three versions of the sensors with different deletion depths. We found that the sensor with a deeper depletion region can achieve a better energy resolution for events of all types of pixel splitting patterns, and has a higher efficiency in collecting photoelectrons produced by X-ray photons. We further study the effect of depletion depth on charge diffusion with a center-of-gravity (CG) model. Based on this work, a highly depleted sCMOS is recommended for applications of soft X-ray spectroscop. ",

These radiative transfer equations allow to model the transport of wave energy density, taking into account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space, with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect; and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources. In the case of a homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, this boundary effect yields a doubling of the intensity, and in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, a canceling of that intensity.

In contrast to this, 100 years ago Alexander Friedmann predicted that the universe expands starting from the point of infinitely large energy density. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of this prediction and its experimental confirmation consisting of the discovery of redshift in the spectra of remote galaxies and relic radiation. After mentioning the horizon problem in the theory of the hot universe, the inflationary model is considered in connection with the concept of quantum vacuum as an alternative to the inflaton field. The accelerated expansion of the universe is discussed as powered by the cosmological constant originating from the quantum vacuum. The conclusion is made that since Alexander Friedmann's prediction of the universe expansion radically altered our picture of the world in comparison with the previous epochs, his name should be put on a par with the names of Ptolemy and Copernicus.

This effect is fueled by micron-scale excitation blockade between Rydberg excitons inducing pair-wise polariton scattering events. Photons incident on an exciton resonance are scatted into blue- and red-detuned pairs, which enjoy relative protection from absorption and thus dominate the transmitted light. We demonstrate that this effect persists in the presence of additional phonon coupling, strong non-radiative decay and across a wide range of experimental parameters.

This work will apply a generalized model based on a modified Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). We will consider the spin generation and diffusion in the FM and HM layers and explain the spintronic THz emission process. This model is suitable for calculating emitted THz signal as a function of FM and HM thicknesses for different geometrical configurations. We will investigate a bilayer geometry as a test case, but the extension to a multi-layer configuration is straightforward. We will show how the different configurations of the sample will influence the THz emission amplitude. ",

    "title": "Satellite-to-Ground Discrete Modulated Continuous Variable Quantum Key  Distribution: The M-PSK and M-QAM Protocols in Low Earth Orbit",
    "abstract": "The Gaussian modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (GM-CVQKD) protocol is known to maximise the mutual information between two parties during quantum key distribution (QKD). However, the reconciliation efficiency significantly decreases in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. In contrast, the more resilient discrete modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (DM-CVQKD) protocol has better reconciliation efficiencies in low SNR regimes. In this paper, we study the Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) DM-CVQKD protocols along with the GM-CVQKD protocol over a satellite-to-ground link in the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. We make use of a satellite-to-ground link model which takes into account geometric, scintillation, and scattering losses due to the link distance, atmospheric turbulence, and atmospheric aerosols, respectively. In addition, recent multidimensional (MD) and multilevel coding and multistage decoding (MLC-MSD) reconciliation method models in combination with multiedge-type low-density parity-check (MET-LDPC) code models have been used to determine the reconciliation efficiency for DM-CVQKD and GM-CVQKD, respectively. The results show that the 4-PSK and 8-PSK protocols outperform GM-CVQKD in both the asymptotic and finite size limit. This is achieved by producing positive key rates at larger link distances and lower elevation angles when the SNR is low, and when collective attacks from an eavesdropper are considered. In addition, the M-QAM protocol produces larger positive secret key rates compared to M-PSK in the asymptotic limit. ",

    "title": "Partial crystallization in a Zr-based bulk metallic glass in selective  laser melting",
    "abstract": "Metals in amorphous state are promising for the use as structural materials due to their superior properties related to the absence of grain boundaries and dislocations.Obtaining the amorphous state requires quenching with a high cooling rate.In conventional technologies,this is the reason for a considerable size limitation hindering application of amorphous alloys.Additive manufacturing (AM) is free of the size limitation.The so-called bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloys have extremely low critical cooling rates and can be used in AM. Recent studies on AM from Zr-based BMGs by selective laser melting(SLM)has proved the possibility of attaining the amorphous state and revealed partial crystallization to be the principal drawback of this process.The present work aims to analyze the conditions for partial crystallization and try to control it by optimizing the process parameters.A comprehensive parametric analysis is accomplished in single-track SLM experiments with Zr-based BMG alloy Vit 106.The observed microstructures are related to the temperature fields and thermal cycles estimated by an analytic heat-transfer model in the laser-impact zone.In the cross section of a laser track,a central bright domain is identified as the remelted zone.An annular darker crystallization zone encircles the remelted zone.The model fits the experimentally obtained dependencies of the remelted zone size versus laser power and scanning speed.It seems that primary crystalline inclusions existing in the substrate before laser processing dissolve at the laser melting.The mean cooling rate in the remelted zone is much greater than the critical cooling rate.Therefore,homogeneous nucleation isn't expected.Nevertheless,the theoretically estimated crystallization times are sufficient for a considerable crystal growth in the heat-affected zone where primary crystalline inclusions and nuclei are not completely dissolved ",

    "title": "Carrier Recombination in Highly Uniform and Phase-Pure GaAs/(Al,Ga)As  Core/Shell Nanowire Arrays on Si(111): Mott Transition and Internal Quantum  Efficiency",
    "abstract": "GaAs-based nanowires are among the most promising candidates for realizing a monolithical integration of III-V optoelectronics on the Si platform. To realize their full potential for applications as light absorbers and emitters, it is crucial to understand their interaction with light governing the absorption and extraction efficiency, as well as the carrier recombination dynamics determining the radiative efficiency. Here, we study the spontaneous emission of zincblende GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core/shell nanowire arrays by $\\mu$-photoluminescence spectroscopy. These ordered arrays are synthesized on patterned Si(111) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy, and exhibit an exceptionally low degree of polytypism for interwire separations exceeding a critical value. We record emission spectra over more than five orders of excitation density for both steady-state and pulsed excitation to identify the nature of the recombination channels. An abrupt Mott transition from excitonic to electron-hole-plasma recombination is observed, and the corresponding Mott density is derived. Combining these experiments with simulations and additional direct measurements of the external quantum efficiency using a perfect diffuse reflector as reference, we are able to extract the internal quantum efficiency as a function of carrier density and temperature as well as the extraction efficiency of the nanowire array. The results vividly document the high potential of GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core/shell nanowires for efficient light emitters integrated on the Si platform. Furthermore, the methodology established in this work can be applied to nanowires of any other materials system of interest for optoelectronic applications. ",
