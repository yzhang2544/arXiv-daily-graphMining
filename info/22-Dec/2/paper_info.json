An experimental demonstration of the directivities exceeding the fundamental Harrington-Chu and Kildal limits is provided -- a phenomenon called superdirectivity. We study the performance of such antennas and obtain excellent agreement between experimentally measured and numerically predicted directivities. The use of high-index, low-loss ceramics can significantly reduce the physical size of such antennas, while maintaining their overall high radiation efficiency. The demonstrated concept scales to other frequency ranges. ",

    "abstract": "Although Rydberg atom-based electric field sensing provides key advantages over traditional antenna-based detection, it generally requires a local oscillator (LO) for low-field and phase resolved detection. In this work, we demonstrate the general applicability of closed-loop quantum interferometric schemes for Rydberg field sensing, which eliminate the need for an LO. We reveal that the quantum-interferometrically defined phase and frequency of our scheme provides an internal reference that enables LO-free full 360$^\\circ$-resolved phase sensitivity. This internal reference can further be used analogously to a traditional LO for atom-based down-mixing to an intermediate frequency for lock-in phase detection, which we demonstrate by demodulating a four phase-state signal broadcast on the atoms.

However they are often complicated lab setups due to the sophisticated stabilizing system and locking electronics. Here we report a compact NLL of 68mL volume, realized by SIL of a diode laser to a miniature FP cavity of 7.7x108 Q and 0.5mL volume, bypassing table-size vaccum, thermal and vibration isolation. We characterized the NLL with a self-delayed heterodyne system, the Lorentzian linewidth reaches 60mHz, and the integrated linewidth is ~80Hz. The frequency noise performance exceeds that of commercial NLLs and the best reported hybrid-integrated NLL realized by SIL to high Q on-chip ring resonators.

    "abstract": "Multicomponent methods are a conceptually simple way to include nuclear quantum effects into quantum chemistry calculations. In multicomponent methods, the electronic molecular orbitals are described using the linear combination of atomic orbitals approximation. This requires the selection of a one-particle electronic basis set which, in practice, is commonly a correlation-consistent basis set. In multicomponent method studies, it has been demonstrated that large electronic basis sets are required for quantum hydrogen nuclei to accurately describe electron-nuclear correlation. However, as we show in this study, much of the need for large electronic basis sets is due to the correlation-consistent electronic basis sets not being optimized to describe nuclear properties and electron-nuclear correlation. Herein, we introduce a series of correlation-consistent electronic basis sets for hydrogen atoms called cc-pVnZ-mc with additional basis functions optimized to reproduce multicomponent density functional theory protonic densities. These new electronic basis sets are shown to yield better protonic densities with fewer electronic basis functions than the standard correlation-consistent basis sets and reproduce other protonic properties such as proton affinities and protonic excitation energies, even though they were not optimized for these purposes. The cc-pVnZ-mc basis sets should enable multicomponent many-body calculations on larger systems due to the improved computational efficiency they provide for a given level of accuracy. ",

Thus, using a CPO as a seed source allow the beneficial implementation of a dissipative soliton (DS) energy scaling approach and a universal concept of CPA in the simple single-path oscillator-amplifier system. The key message is avoiding a destructive nonlinearity in the final stages of amplifiers and compressor elements by using a chirped high-fidelity pulse from CPO as a seed for a single-pass CPA. Our main intention is to realize this approach in a Cr2+:ZnS-based CPO as a source of energy-scalable DS with well-controllable phase characteristics for a single-pass Cr2+:ZnS polycrystalline ceramic amplifier. A qualitative comparison of experimental and theoretical results provides a road map for the development and energy scaling of the hybrid CPO-CPA laser systems, without compromising pulse duration.

The experiment shows efficient power scaling with the excitation of intra-mode beatings, leading to a pronounced nonlinear mode-coupling that would result in a Kerr-lens mode-locking (KLM). We suggest that a particularly high nonlinearity in Cr:ZnS combined with multimode waveguide leads to a soft aperture induced by a pump beam. The latter provides an effective spatial mode control in a nonlinear multimode waveguide, thereby, opening the way to the birth of a spatio-temporal dissipative soliton or a 'light bullet' formation. The paper is therefore forming the basis for the future distributed Kerr-lens mode locking in the energy-scalable solid-state wave-guide laser. ",

This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light-matter interactions in this range. Herein, we address this limitation and demonstrate an all-dielectric silicon-integrated metasurface enabling polarization-induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies. The platform consists of a two-dimensional Si/GeSn core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, we show that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high-index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization-modulated resonances. This tunability is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10^{-2} changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. ",

However, existing architectures are designed for a single task but fail to multiplex different tasks in parallel within a single monolithic system due to the task competition that deteriorates the model performance. This paper proposes a novel optical multi-task learning system by designing multi-wavelength diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) with the joint optimization method. By encoding multi-task inputs into multi-wavelength channels, the system can increase the computing throughput and significantly alle-viate the competition to perform multiple tasks in parallel with high accuracy. We design the two-task and four-task D2NNs with two and four spectral channels, respectively, for classifying different inputs from MNIST, FMNIST, KMNIST, and EMNIST databases. The numerical evaluations demonstrate that, under the same network size, mul-ti-wavelength D2NNs achieve significantly higher classification accuracies for multi-task learning than single-wavelength D2NNs. Furthermore, by increasing the network size, the multi-wavelength D2NNs for simultaneously performing multiple tasks achieve comparable classification accuracies with respect to the individual training of multiple single-wavelength D2NNs to perform tasks separately. Our work paves the way for developing the wave-length-division multiplexing technology to achieve high-throughput neuromorphic photonic computing and more general AI systems to perform multiple tasks in parallel.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic relations among these physical quantities are far from clear. Here, we prove the universal geometric relations among them in acoustics, independent on wave structure details. Particularly, we connect acoustic spin and torque to the cross product of time-averaged energy flow and reactive power, as well as to the local vorticity of energy flow. These relations are universally valid, verified in a variety of different acoustic systems. We also demonstrate the multipole mechanical torques and forces generated in three acoustic near-field sources: Janus, Huygens and Spin sources, applying on small lossy particles. These universal geometric relations uncover hidden locking relations beyond simple spin-momentum locking of near-field waves, and show the basic principles between the acoustic spin, radiation torque, and energy flow, reactive power.

Both numerical and analytical models reproduce very well the details of the split spin noise spectra: this technique thus allows a simple and direct measurement of the light shifts, and its polarization dependence permits to reveal the level structure in a non ambiguous manner.

Using these data, we assemble the first comprehensive survey of total pressures inside and outside of the heliopause, in the interstellar gas surrounding the heliosphere, and in the surrounding Local Cavity to determine whether the total pressures in each region are in balance with each other and with the gravitational pressure exerted by the Galaxy. We inter-compare total pressures in each region that include thermal, non-thermal, plasma, ram, and magnetic pressure components. An important result is the role of dynamic (ram) pressure. Total pressure balance at the heliopause can only be maintained with a substantial contribution of dynamic pressure from inside. Also, total pressure balance between the outer heliosphere and pristine very local ISM (VLISM) and between the pristine VLISM and the Local Cavity requires large dynamic pressure contributions. ",
