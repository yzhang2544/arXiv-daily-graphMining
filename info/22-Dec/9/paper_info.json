    "abstract": "We consider the representations of the optical Dirac equation, especially ones where the Hamiltonian is purely real-valued. This is equivalent, for Maxwell's equations, to the Majorana representation of the massless Dirac (Weyl) equation. We draw analogies between the Dirac, chiral and Majorana representations of the Dirac and optical Dirac equations, and derive two new optical Majorana representations. Just as the Dirac and chiral representations are related to optical spin and helicity states, these Majorana representations of the optical Dirac equation are associated with the linear polarisation of light. This provides a means to compare electron and electromagnetic wave equations in the context of classical field theory. ",

    "abstract": "We propose new models to describe the imaginary part of the electrical permittivity of dielectric and semiconductor materials in the fundamental absorption region. We work out our procedure based on the well-known structure of the Tauc-Lorentz model and the band-fluctuations approach to derive a 5-parameter formula that describes the Urbach, Tauc and high-absorption regions of direct and indirect semiconductors. Main features of the models are the self-consistent generation of the exponential Urbach tail below the bandgap and the incorporation of the Lorentz oscillator behaviour due to electronic transitions above the fundamental region. We apply and test our models on optical data of direct (MAPbI$_{3}$, GaAs and InP), indirect (GaP and c-Si), and amorphous (a-Si) semiconductors, accurately describing the spectra of the imaginary part of the electrical permittivity. Lastly, we compare our models with other similarly inspired models to assess the optical bandgap, Urbach tail and oscillator central resonance energy. ",

    "title": "Nonlinear photonic disclination states",
    "abstract": "Higher-order topological insulators are unusual materials that can support topologically protected states, whose dimensionality is lower than the dimensionality of the structure at least by 2. Among the most intriguing examples of such states are zero-dimensional corner modes existing in two-dimensional higher-order insulators. In contrast to corner states, recently discovered disclination states also belong to the class of higher-order topological states, but are bound to the boundary of the disclination defect of the higher-order topological insulator and can be predicted using the bulk-disclination correspondence principle. Here, we present the first example of the nonlinear photonic disclination state bifurcating from its linear counterpart in the disclination lattice with a pentagonal or heptagonal core. We show that nonlinearity allows to tune location of the disclination states in the bandgap and notably affects their shapes. The structure of the disclination lattice is crucial for stability of these nonlinear topological states: for example, disclination states are stable in the heptagonal lattice and are unstable nearly in the entire gap of the pentagonal lattice. Nonlinear disclination states reported here are thresholdless and can be excited even at low powers. Nonlinear zero-energy states coexisting in these structures with disclination states are also studied. Our results suggest that disclination lattices can be used in the design of various nonlinear topological functional devices, while disclination states supported by them may play an important role in applications, where strong field confinement together with topological protection are important, such as the design of topological lasers and enhancement of generation of high harmonics.

Meanwhile, the worldwide emphasis on sustainable development has motivated the development and application of bio-mass materials in every field, including the engineering construction. The purpose of this study is to measure and investigate the performance of a structure-used glued laminated bamboo (Glubam) and spruce-pine-fir (SPF) as soundproof or sound-absorbing materials. The impedance tube method was used to measure the sound reduction index and sound absorption coefficient of glubam and SPF in the lab. After doing some comparison studies, it can be found that glubam and SPF have good performance in sound insulation but behave weakly in sound absorption, and glubam exhibits similar even better acoustic properties than SPF. Moreover, a finite element model was built up using ABAQUS to predict sound insulation properties of materials. According to the numerical results of sound reduction index obtained from the finite element model, developing composite materials and double-layer panels with cavity between should be effective on improving the soundproof performance of SPF and glubam.

We propose a Darwinist evolutionary approach, combined with quantum mechanics to cement our attempt in explaining a centuries long mystery - decision-making under uncertainty. And we believe that it is the unification of people's subjective beliefs and the objective world that will solve this mystery. In this paper, we postulate a quantum decision theory to attempt to do just that. A quantum density operator as a value operator is proposed to simulate people's subjective beliefs. Then the value operator will guide people to choose corresponding actions based on their subjective beliefs through the objective world. The value operator can be constructed from quantum gates and logic operations as a quantum decision tree. The genetic programming is applied to optimize and auto-generate quantum decision trees. ",

Here, we report an infrared-transparent electromagnetic shielding windows based on metal mesh with irregular patterns. The mesh coatings are prepared on sapphire substrate using ultraviolet photolithography technology, and provide efficient electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of more than 20 dB in the wide frequency range of 1.7~18 GHz while maintaining high infrared optical transparency. In addition, there is no distinct variation in shielding effectiveness between low and high frequency range, exhibiting a balanced shielding characteristic throughout a broad frequency band.

Here, we present a comprehensive multi-parameter optimization of pulsed laser deposition of Sb2S3 towards this end. We correlate the specific deposition and annealing parameters with the resulting optical properties and propose the combination leading to films with extraordinary qualities ({\\Delta}n = 1.2 at 633 nm). Finally, we identify crystal orientations and vibrational modes associated with the largest change in the refractive index and propose them as useful indicators of the Sb2S3 switching contrast. ",

Reproducibility on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 is tested, and ultimately limited by the frequency reference and check-thermometer stability.

Here we describe a laser frequency stabilization technique for exciting non-ground state atomic transitions that solves these challenges and requires only a small amount of additional electronics. We describe the operation, capabilities, and limitations of this frequency stabilization technique and quantitatively characterize measure its performance.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a general and complete solution for the undrained cylindrical cavity expansion problem in non-associated Mohr-Coulomb soil under non-hydrostatic initial stress field (i.e., arbitrary K_0 values of the earth pressure coefficient), by expanding a unique and efficient graphical solution procedure recently proposed by Chen & Wang in 2022 for the special in situ stress case with K_0 = 1. The new generalized, graph-based theoretical framework contains two essential components: the geometrical analysis to track the stress path trajectory/evolution in different sectors of the deviatoric plane; and a full Lagrangian formulation of both the constitutive relationship and radial equilibrium equation to analytically determine the representative soil particle responses at the cavity surface. It is interesting to find that the cavity expansion deviatoric stress path is always composed of a series of piecewise straight lines, for all different case scenarios of K_0 being involved. The salient advantage/feature of the present general graphical approach lies in that it can deduce the cavity expansion responses in full closed form, nevertheless being free of the limitation of the intermediacy assumption for the vertical stress and of the difficulty existing in the traditional zoning method that involves cumbersome, sequential determination of distinct Mohr-Coulomb plastic regions. The analytical closed-form solutions developed herein can be regarded as a definitive one for the undrained cavity expansion problem in classical Mohr-Coulomb materials without the approximations and simplifications in previous solutions, and will be of great value for the interpretation of pressuremeter tests in cohesive-frictional soils.

Chemical aspects of processes occurring at the electrode surface were discussed and simulated with the help of molecular docking and density functional theory modelling. It was assumed that the antibiotic fingerprint reveals as potential drift of electrodes owing to redox degradation of antibiotic molecules followed by pH change or complexation with ions present in milk. Gradient boosting algorithm showed the best efficiency towards training the machine learning model. High accuracy was achieved for recognition of antibiotics in milk. The elaborated method may be incorporated into existing milking systems at dairy farms for monitoring the residue concentrations of antibiotics. ",

Encrypting the prediction process can solve this problem by double-blind model evaluation and prohibits the extraction of training or query data. However, contemporary ML models based on fully homomorphic encryption or federated learning are either too expensive for practical use or have to trade higher speed for weaker security. We have implemented secure and computationally feasible encrypted machine learning models using oblivious transfer enabling and secure predictions of molecular quantum properties across chemical compound space. However, we find that encrypted predictions using kernel ridge regression models are a million times more expensive than without encryption. This demonstrates a dire need for a compact machine learning model architecture, including molecular representation and kernel matrix size, that minimizes model evaluation costs. ",

The fTWA was also compared to results from the exact diagonalization method for smaller systems, and in general the agreement was found to be good.

Here, we study the sub-terahertz photocoductivity of gapped bilayer graphene with electrically-induced p-n junctions. We find a strong positive contribution from junctions to resistance, temperature resistance coefficient and photo-resistivity at cryogenic temperatures T ~ 20 K. The contribution to these quantities from junctions exceeds strongly the bulk values at uniform channel doping even at small band gaps ~ 10 meV. We further show that positive junction photoresistance is a hallmark of interband tunneling, and not of intra-band thermionic conduction.
