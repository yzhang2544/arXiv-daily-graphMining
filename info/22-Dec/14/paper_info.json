    "abstract": "Illumination uniformity is a critical parameter for excitation and data extraction quality in widefield biological imaging applications. However, typical imaging systems suffer from spatial and spectral non-uniformity due to non-ideal optical elements, thus require complex solutions for illumination corrections. We present Effective Uniform Color-Light Integration Device (EUCLID), a simple and cost-effective illumination source for uniformity corrections. EUCLID employs a diffuse-reflective, adjustable hollow cavity that allows for uniform mixing of light from discrete light sources and modifies the source field distribution to compensate for spatial non-uniformity introduced by optical components in the imaging system. In this study, we characterize the light coupling efficiency of the proposed design and compare the uniformity performance with the conventional method. EUCLID demonstrates a remarkable illumination improvement for multi-spectral imaging in both Nelsonian and Koehler alignment with a maximum spatial deviation of ~1% across a wide field-of-view. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a glide symmetric optical waveguide exhibiting a stationary inflection point (SIP) in the Bloch wavenumber dispersion relation. An SIP is a third order exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) where three Bloch eigenmodes coalesce to form a so-called frozen mode with vanishing group velocity and diverging amplitude. We show that the incorporation of chirped distributed Bragg reflectors and distributed coupling between waveguides in the periodic structure facilitates the SIP formation and greatly enhances the characteristics of the frozen mode regime. We confirm the existence of an SIP in two ways: by observing the flatness of the dispersion diagram and also by using a coalescence parameter describing the separation of the three eigenvectors collapsing on each other. We find that in the absence of losses, both the quality factor and the group delay at the SIP grow with the cubic power of the cavity length. The frozen mode regime can be very attractive for light amplification and lasing, in optical delay lines, sensors, and modulators. ",

    "abstract": "The use of the Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) platform has been prominent for realizing CMOS-compatible, high-performance photonic integrated circuits (PICs). But in recent years, the silicon-nitride-on-silicon-dioxide (SiN-on-SiO$_2$) platform has garnered increasing interest as an alternative to the SOI platform for realizing high-performance PICs. This is because of its several beneficial properties over the SOI platform, such as low optical losses, high thermo-optic stability, broader wavelength transparency range, and high tolerance to fabrication-process variations. However, SiN-on-SiO$_2$ based active devices such as modulators are scarce and lack in desired performance, due to the absence of free-carrier based activity in the SiN material and the complexity of integrating other active materials with SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform. This shortcoming hinders the SiN-on-SiO$_2$ platform for realizing active PICs. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate a SiN-on-SiO$_2$ microring resonator (MRR) based active modulator in this article. Our designed MRR modulator employs an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO)-SiN-ITO thin-film stack, in which the ITO thin films act as the upper and lower claddings of the SiN MRR. The ITO-SiN-ITO thin-film stack leverages the free-carrier assisted, high-amplitude refractive index change in the ITO films to effect a large electro-refractive optical modulation in the device. Based on the electrostatic, transient, and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, conducted using photonics foundry-validated tools, we show that our modulator achieves 280 pm/V resonance modulation efficiency, 67.8 GHz 3-dB modulation bandwidth, $\\sim$19 nm free-spectral range (FSR), $\\sim$0.23 dB insertion loss, and 10.31 dB extinction ratio for optical on-off-keying (OOK) modulation at 30 Gb/s.

    "abstract": "The $1s^2->1s2p(^1P)$ excitation in confined and compressed helium atoms in either the bulk material or encapsulated in a bubble is shifted to energies higher than that in the free atom. For bulk helium, the energy shifts predicted from non-empirical electronic structure computations are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values. However, there are significant discrepancies both between the results of experiments on different bubbles and between these and the well established descriptions of the bulk. A critique is presented of previous attempts to determine the densities in bubbles by measuring the intensities of the electrons inelastically scattered in STEM experiments. The reported densities are untrustworthy because it was assumed that the cross section for inelastic electron scattering was the same as that of a free atom whilst it is now known that this property is greatly enhanced for atoms confined at significant pressures. It is shown how experimental measurements of bubbles can be combined with data on the bulk using a graphical method to determine whether the behavior of an encapsulated guest differs from that in the bulk material. Experimental electron energy loss data from an earlier study of helium encapsulated in silicon is reanalyzed using this new method to show that the properties of the helium in these bubbles do not differ significantly from those in the bulk thereby enabling the densities in the bubbles to be determined. These enable the bubble pressures to be deduced from a well established experimentally derived equation of state. It is shown that the errors of up to 80% in the incorrectly determined densities are greatly magnified in the predicted pressures which can be too large by factors of over seven. This has major practical implications for the study of radiation damage of materials exposed to $\\alpha$ particle bombardment. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on non-Hermitian optical systems having exceptional points (EPs) have revealed a host of unique characteristics associated with these singularities, including unidirectional invisibility, chiral mode switching and laser self-termination, to mention just a few examples. The vast majority of these works focused either on passive systems or active structures where the EPs were accessed below the lasing threshold, i.e. when the system description is inherently linear. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that EP singularities in coupled semiconductor nanolasers can be accessed and tracked above the lasing threshold, where they become branch points of a nonlinear dynamical system. Contrary to the common belief that unavoidable cavity detuning will impede the formation of an EP, here we demonstrate that this same detuning is necessary for compensating the carrier-induced frequency shift, hence restoring the nonlinear EP in the lasing regime. Furthermore, unlike linear non-Hermitian systems, we find that the spectral location of EPs above laser threshold varies as a function of total pump power and can therefore be continuously tracked. Our work is a first step towards the realization of lasing EPs in more complex laser geometries, and enabling the enhancement of photonic local density of states through non-Hermitian symmetries combined with nonlinear interactions in coupled laser arrays.

The dispersive properties of the supported localized acoustic surface waves are influenced by competing power-flow channels provided by the BNN couplings, that generate extrema in the dispersion spectra within the first Brillouin zone.

    "abstract": "Fused silica glass is a material of choice for micromechanical, microfluidic, and optical devices due to its ultimate chemical resistance, optical, electrical, and mechanical performance. Wet etching in hydrofluoric solutions especially a buffered oxide etching (BOE) solution is still the key method for fabricating fused silica glass-based microdevices. It is well known that protective mask integrity during deep fused silica wet etching is a big challenge due to chemical stability of fused glass and extremely aggressive BOE properties. Here, we propose a multilevel fused silica glass microstructures fabrication route based on deep wet etching through a stepped mask with just a one grayscale photolithography step. First, we provide a deep comprehensive analysis of a fused quartz dissolution mechanism in BOE solution and calculate the main fluoride fractions like $HF^-_2$, $F^-$, $(HF)_2$ components in a BOE solution as a function of pH and $NH_4F:HF$ ratio at room temperature. Then, we experimentally investigate the influence of BOE concentration ($NH_4F:HF$ from 1:1 to 14:1) on the mask resistance, etch rate and profile isotropy during fused silica 60 minutes etching through a metal/photoresist mask. Finally, we demonstrate a high-quality multilevel over-200 um isotropic wet etching process with the rate up to 3 um/min, which could be of a great interest for advanced fused silica microdevices with flexure suspensions, inertial masses, microchannels, and through-wafer holes.

    "abstract": "Recently, digital holographic imaging techniques (including methods with heterodyne detection) have found increased attention in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. However, holographic techniques rely on the use of a reference beam in order to obtain phase information. This letter investigates the potential of reference-free THz holographic imaging and proposes novel supervised and unsupervised deep learning (DL) methods for amplitude and phase recovery. The calculations incorporate Fresnel diffraction as prior knowledge. We first show that our unsupervised dual network can predict amplitude and phase simultaneously, thus overcoming the limitation of previous studies which could only predict phase objects. This is demonstrated with synthetic 2D image data as well as with measured 2D THz diffraction images. The advantage of unsupervised DL is that it can be used directly without labeling by human experts. We then address supervised DL -- a concept of general applicability. We introduce training with a database set of 2D images taken in the visible spectra range and modified by us numerically to emulate THz images. With this approach, we avoid the prohibitively time-consuming collection of a large number of THz-frequency images. The results obtained with both approaches represent the first steps towards fast holographic THz imaging with reference-beam-free low-cost power detection. ",

However, the existing training approaches cannot address the extensive accumulation of systematic errors in large-scale PNNs, resulting in a significant decrease in model performance in physical systems. Here, we propose dual adaptive training (DAT) that allows the PNN model to adapt to substantial systematic errors and preserves its performance during the deployment. By introducing the systematic error prediction networks with task-similarity joint optimization, DAT achieves the high similarity mapping between the PNN numerical models and physical systems and high-accurate gradient calculations during the dual backpropagation training. We validated the effectiveness of DAT by using diffractive PNNs and interference-based PNNs on image classification tasks. DAT successfully trained large-scale PNNs under major systematic errors and preserved the model classification accuracies comparable to error-free systems. The results further demonstrated its superior performance over the state-of-the-art in situ training approaches. DAT provides critical support for constructing large-scale PNNs to achieve advanced architectures and can be generalized to other types of AI systems with analog computing errors. ",

    "abstract": "Dephasing processes significantly impact the performance of deterministic single-photon sources. Dephasing broadens the spectral line and suppresses the indistinguishability of the emitted photons, which is undesirable for many applications, primarily for quantum computing. We consider a light emitted by a two-level system with a pulsed incoherent pump in the presence of the spectral filter. The spectral filter allows control of the second-order autocorrelation function, indistinguishability, and quantum yield. We show that narrow spectral filters can increase the indistinguishability of the emitted light while undermining the quantum yield. The influence of the spectral filter on the second-order correlation function depends on the duration of the pump. When the pumping pulse is long compared to the lifetime of the two-level system, the narrow spectral filters lead to a rapid increase in the second-order autocorrelation function. In this limit, the statistics of the light from the two-level system inherit the statistics of the incoherent pump. In the case of the short duration of the pump pulse, it is possible to preserve single-photon properties to some degree for the sub-lifetime width of the spectral filter. Moreover, when the light emitted by the single-photon source is used to control a quantum system, e.g., cavity, the single-photon properties of the light manifest themselves differently, depending on the response time of the quantum system. In particular, in the case of long response time, the spectral filter with sub-lifetime width can provide the near-zero second-order autocorrelation function. ",

This capability has recently proved important for exploring quantum many-body physics in the driven-dissipative setting.
