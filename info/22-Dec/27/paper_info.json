    "abstract": "This report introduces Juno, a modular Python package for optical design and simulation. Juno consists of a complete library that includes a graphical user interface to design and visualise arbitrary optical elements, set up wave propagation simulations and visualise their results. To ensure an efficient visualisation of the results, all simulation data are stored in a structured database that can filter and sort the output. Finally, we present a practical use case for Juno, where optical design and fabrication are interlaced in a feedback cycle. The presented data show how to compare the simulated and the measured propagation; if a difference or unexpected behaviour is found, we show how to convert and import the optical element profile from a profilometer measurement. The propagation through the profile can provide immediate feedback about the quality of the element and a measure of the effects brought by differences between the idealised and the actual profile, therefore, allowing to exclude the experimental errors and to weigh every aspect of fabrication errors.

    "abstract": "The combination of optical time transfer and optical clocks opens up the possibility of large-scale free-space networks that connect both ground-based optical clocks and future space-based optical clocks. Such networks promise better tests of general relativity, dark matter searches, and gravitational wave detection. The ability to connect optical clocks to a distant satellite could enable space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), advanced satellite navigation, clock-based geodesy, and thousand-fold improvements in intercontinental time dissemination. Thus far, only optical clocks have pushed towards quantum-limited performance. In contrast, optical time transfer has not operated at the analogous quantum limit set by the number of received photons. Here, we demonstrate time transfer with near quantum-limited acquisition and timing at 10,000 times lower received power than previous approaches. Over 300 km between mountaintops in Hawaii with launched powers as low as 40 $\\mu$W, distant timescales are synchronized to 320 attoseconds. This nearly quantum-limited operation is critical for long-distance free-space links where photons are few and amplification costly -- at 4.0 mW transmit power, this approach can support 102 dB link loss, more than sufficient for future time transfer to geosynchronous orbits.

However, operando characterization of the buried interface morphology in solid-state cells is particularly difficult because of the lack of direct optical access. Destructive techniques that require isolating the interface inadvertently modify the interface and cannot be used for operando monitoring. In this work, we introduce the concept of thermal wave sensing using modified 3-omega sensors that is attached to the outside of the lithium metal-solid state cells to non-invasively probe the morphology of the lithium metal-electrolyte interface. We show that the thermal interface resistance measured by the 3-omega sensors relates directly to the physical morphology of the interface and demonstrate that 3-omega thermal wave sensing can be used for non-invasive operando monitoring the morphology evolution of the lithium metal-solid state electrolyte interface.

    "abstract": "Because of their massless nature, photons do not interact in linear optical media. However, light beam propagation in nonlinear media permits to break this paradigm, and makes it possible to observe photon-photon interactions. Based on this principle, a beam of light propagating in a nonlinear multimode optical system can be described as a gas of interacting particles. As a consequence, the spatio-temporal evolution of this photon gas is expressed in terms of macroscopic thermodynamic variables, e.g., temperature and chemical potential. Moreover, the gas evolution is subject to experiencing typical thermodynamic phenomena, such as thermalization. The meaning of thermodynamic variables associated with the photon gas must not be confused with their classical counterparts, e.g., the gas temperature cannot be measured by means of standard thermometers. Although the thermodynamic parameters of a multimode photon gas result from a rigorous mathematical derivation, their physical meaning is still unclear. In this work, we report on optical calorimetric measurements, which exploit nonlinear beam propagation in multimode optical fibers. Our results show that, indeed, heat only flows from a hot to a cold photon gas subsystem. This provides an unequivocal demonstration that nonlinear multimode wave propagation phenomena are governed by the second law of thermodynamics. In addition to be fundamental, our findings provide a new approach to light-by-light activated management of laser beams. ",

The time-derivative term from the unitary transformation is found to be crucial in supplementing the transverse component of the electric field in higher orders. Final expressions are obtained for general combined electric and magnetic fields, including strong magnetic fields. The time-derivative of the electric field is shown to enter only in the seventh order of the fine-structure constant if the transformation is carried out in the standard fashion.

    "abstract": "On-chip spatial and polarization multiplexing have emerged as a powerful strategy to boost the bandwidth of integrated optical transceivers. State-of-the-art multiplexers require accurate control of the relative phase or the spatial distribution among different guided optical modes, seriously compromising the bandwidth and performance of the devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach based on the coupling between guided modes in integrated waveguides and optical beams free-propagating on the chip plane. The engineering of the evanescent coupling between the guided modes and free-propagating beams allows spatial and polarization multiplexing with state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the potential and versatility of this approach, we have developed a two-polarization multiplexed link and a three-mode multiplexed link using standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator technology. The two-polarization link shows a measured -35 dB crosstalk bandwidth of 180 nm, while the three-mode link exhibits a -20 dB crosstalk bandwidth of 195 nm. These bandwidths cover the S, C, L, and U communication bands. We used these links to demonstrate error-free transmission (bit-error-rate < 10-9) of two and three non-return-to-zero signals at 40 Gbps each, with power penalties below 0.08 dB and 1.5 dB for the two-polarization and three-mode links respectively. The approach demonstrated here for two polarizations and three modes is also applicable to future implementation of more complex multiplexing schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit interactions of light are ubiquitous in multiple branches of nanophotonics, including optical wave localization. In that framework, it is widely accepted that circularly polarized beams lead to spin-dependent apparent shifts of dipolar targets commonly referred to as optical mirages. In contrast, these optical mirages vanish when the illumination comes from a spinless beam such as a linearly polarized wave. Here we show that optical localization errors emerge for particles sustaining electric and magnetic dipolar response under the illumination of spinless beams. As an example, we calculate the optical mirage for the scattering by a high refractive index nanosphere under the illumination of a linearly polarized plane wave carrying null spin, orbital, and total angular momentum. Our results point to an overlooked interference between the electric and magnetic dipoles rather than the spin-orbit interactions of light as the origin for the tilted position of the nanosphere. ",

These metasurfaces, which include a set of four diodes as a full wave rectifier, are capable of sensing different waves even at the same frequency in response to the incident waveform, or more specifically the pulse width. This study reveals the relationship between the electromagnetic response of such waveform-selective metasurfaces and the SPICE parameters of the diodes used. First, we show that reducing a parasitic capacitive component of the diodes is important for realization of waveform-selective metasurfaces in a higher frequency regime. Second, we report that the operating power level is closely related to the saturation current and the breakdown voltage of the diodes. Moreover, the operating power range is found to be broadened by introducing an additional resistor into the inside of the diode bridge. Our study is expected to provide design guidelines for circuit-based waveform-selective metasurfaces to select/fabricate optimal diodes and enhance the waveform-selective performance at the target frequency and power level.

This opens up the way for the realization of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation and polariton lasing at room temperature -- the inversion-free low-threshold stimulated emission. However, polariton lasing in perovskite planar photon cavities without Bragg mirrors has not yet been observed and proved experimentally. In this work, we employ perovskite metasurface, fabricated with nanoimprint lithography, supporting so-called exceptional points to demonstrate the room-temperature polariton lasing. The exceptional points in exciton-polariton dispersion of the metasurface appear upon optically pumping in the nonlinear regime in the spectral vicinity of a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum providing high mode confinement with the enhanced local density of states beneficial for polariton condensation. The observed lasing emission possesses high directivity with a divergence angle of around 1$^\\circ$ over one axis. The employed nanoimprinting approach for solution-processable large-scale polariton lasers is compatible with various planar photonic platforms suitable for on-chip integration. ",

Our findings are illustrated in the paradigmatic example provided by an optical Kerr cavity with diffraction and anomalous dispersion, with the addition of an attractive three-dimensional parabolic potential. The potential breaks the translational symmetry along all directions, and impacts the system in a qualitatively unexpected manner: three-dimensional solitons, or light-bullets, are the only existing and stable states for a given set of parameters. This property is extremely rare, if not unknown, in passive nonlinear physical systems. As a result, the excitation of the cavity with any input field leads to the deterministic formation of a target soliton or breather, with a spatiotemporal profile that unambiguously corresponds to the given cavity and pumping conditions. In addition, the tuning of the potential width along the temporal direction results in the existence of a plethora of stable asymmetric solitons. Our results may provide a solid route towards the observation of dissipative light bullets and three-dimensional breathers. ",

The impact of modulation frequency on plasma jet discharge behavior, geometrical variation, reactive species emission, and plasma parameters (gas temperature Tg, electron excitation temperature Texc, and electron density (ne) are studied using various diagnostics such as optical imaging, emission spectra, and thermal diagnostics. From the experiments, it is observed that operating the plasma jet at low pulse modulation frequencies (around 50 Hz) provides enhanced plasma dimensions, higher electron densities and greater optical emission from reactive species (viz., He I, O, OH, N2+, etc.) as compared to the higher modulation frequencies. Besides the low power consumption, the three times less gas temperature of the modulated plasma jet than the continuous wave mode makes it more advantageous for the applications. Moreover, the influence of duty cycle (D) and applied RF power (P) on the plasma jet characteristics are also discussed. It is found that 10- 40% duty cycle operation provides the most favorable attributes. More importantly, the concern of shorter plasma length in RF plasma jets is overcome by operating at 10- 20% duty cycle with increased applied power. This work thoroughly characterizes helium atmospheric pressure RF plasma jet with a wide range of pulse mode operating parameters, which could help select appropriate operating conditions for various industrial and biomedical applications.

Conventional LFM designs require a trade-off between position and angular resolution, requiring one to sacrifice resolving power for increased depth of field (DOF) or vice versa. In this work, we demonstrate a LFM design that does not require this trade-off by utilizing the inherent strong correlation between spatial-temporal entangled photon pairs. Here, one photon from the pair is used to illuminate a sample from which the position information of the photon is captured directly by a camera. By virtue of the strong momentum/angular anti-correlation between the two photons, the angular information of the illumination photon can then be inferred by measuring the angle of its entangled partner on a different camera. We demonstrate that a resolving power of 5$\\mu$m can be maintained with a DOF of $\\sim500$$\\mu$m, over an order of magnitude larger compared to conventional LFM designs.

Here, we apply dynamical decoupling techniques to suppress magnetic noise and extend the spin coherence time by nearly two orders of magnitude, approaching the fundamental $T_1$ relaxation limit. Based on this improvement, we demonstrate advanced spin control and a set of quantum sensing protocols to detect electromagnetic signals in the MHz range with sub-Hz resolution. This work lays the foundation for nanoscale sensing using spin defects in an exfoliable material and opens a promising path to quantum sensors and quantum networks integrated into ultra-thin structures.

    "abstract": "The quantum internet -- in synergy with the internet that we use today -- promises an enabling platform for next-generation information processing, including exponentially speed-up distributed computation, secure communication, and high-precision metrology. The key ingredients for realizing such a global network are the distribution and storage of quantum entanglement. As quantum networks are likely to be based on existing fibre networks, telecom-wavelength entangled photons and corresponding quantum memories are of central interest. Recently, ${\\rm ^{167}Er^{3+}}$ ions have been identified as a promising candidate for an efficient, broadband quantum memory at telecom wavelength. However, to date, no storage of entangled photons, the crucial step of quantum memory using these ions, has been reported. Here, we demonstrate the storage and recall of the entangled state of two telecom photons generated from an integrated photonic chip based on silicon nitride. Combining the natural narrow linewidth of the entangled photons and long storage time of ${\\rm ^{167}Er^{3+}}$ ions, we achieve storage time of 400 ns, more than one order of magnitude longer than in previous works. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is certified by a violation of an entanglement witness by more than 12 standard deviations (-0.161 $\\pm$ 0.012) at 400 ns storage time. These results pave the way for realizing quantum networks based on solid-state devices. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum illumination has been used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Relying on coincidence detection, such a quantum LiDAR has a resolution limited by the response time of the detector and suffers from jamming noise. Inspired by the Zou-Wang-Mandel experiment, we build a quantum induced coherence (QuIC) LiDAR without directly detecting the photons reflected from the object, intrinsically immune to environmental and jamming noise. The key element is that the reflected photons are used to erase the which-way information of its entangled partners, whose light path is scanned to obtain the distance of the object via single photon interference rather than coincidence detection. In QuIC LiDAR, the noise accompanying the reflected probe light from the object cannot enter our detector. This method paves a new way of battling noise in precise quantum electromagnetic sensing and ranging. ",

    "title": "Quantum enhanced probing of multilayered-samples",
    "abstract": "Quantum sensing exploits quantum phenomena to enhance the detection and estimation of classical parameters of physical systems and biological entities, particularly so as to overcome the inefficiencies of its classical counterparts. A particularly promising approach within quantum sensing is Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography which relies on non-classical light sources to reconstruct the internal structure of multilayered materials. Compared to traditional classical probing, Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography provides enhanced-resolution images and is unaffected by even-order dispersion. One of the main limitations of this technique lies in the appearance of artifacts and echoes, i.e. fake structures that appear in the coincidence interferogram, which hinder the retrieval of information required for tomography scans. Here, by utilizing a full theoretical model, in combination with a fast genetic algorithm to post-process the data, we successfully extract the morphology of complex multilayered samples and thoroughly distinguish real interfaces, artifacts, and echoes. We test the effectiveness of the model and algorithm by comparing its predictions to experimentally-generated interferograms through the controlled variation of the pump wavelength. Our results could potentially lead to the development of practical high-resolution probing of complex structures and non-invasive scanning of photo-degradable materials for biomedical imaging/sensing, clinical applications, and materials science.

    "abstract": "Driven by the need to develop efficient atom-photon interfaces, recent efforts have proposed replacing cavities by large arrays of cold atoms that can support subradiant or superradiant collective states. In practice, subradiant states are decoupled from radiation, which constitutes a hurdle to most applications. In this work, we study theoretically a protocol that bypasses this limit using a one dimensional (1D) chain composed of N three-level atoms in a V-shaped configuration. Throughout the protocol, the chain behaves as a time-varying metamaterial: enabling absorption, storage and on-demand emission in a spectrally and spatially controlled mode. Taking into account the quantum nature of atoms, we establish the boundary between the linear regime and the nonlinear regime where singly and doubly excited subradiant states compete in the instantaneous decay rate during the storage ",

In these forewords we give a general review of the historical context explaining how de Broglie and Bohm developed their interpretations of quantum mechanics. We further analyze the relationship between these two great thinkers and emphasize the role of several collaborators and continuators of their ontological approach to physics. ",

Furthermore, qubit sources should be programmable and have high brightness to be useful for quantum algorithms and grant resilience to losses. However, widespread encoding schemes only combine at most two of these properties. Here, we overcome this hurdle by demonstrating a programmable silicon nano-photonic chip generating frequency-bin entangled photons, an encoding scheme compatible with long-range transmission over optical links. The emitted quantum states can be manipulated using existing telecommunication components, including active devices that can be integrated in silicon photonics. As a demonstration, we show our chip can be programmed to generate the four computational basis states, and the four maximally-entangled Bell states, of a two-qubits system. Our device combines all the key-properties of on-chip state reconfigurability and dense integration, while ensuring high brightness, fidelity, and purity. ",

    "abstract": "We use optimal control theory to show that for a closed $\\Lambda$-system where the excited intermediate level decays to the lower levels with a common large rate, the optimal scheme for population transfer between the lower levels is actually optical pumping. In order to obtain this result we exploit the large decay rate to eliminate adiabatically the weakly coupled excited state, then perform a transformation to the basis comprised of the dark and bright states, and finally apply optimal control to this transformed system. Subsequently, we confirm the optimality of the optical pumping scheme for the original closed $\\Lambda$-system using numerical optimal control. We also demonstrate numerically that optical pumping remains optimal when the decay rate to the target state is larger than that to the initial state or the two rates are not very different from each other. The present work is expected to find application in various tasks of quantum information processing, where such systems are encountered. ",
