    "abstract": "We describe the advantages of diffuse illumination in laser holography for ophthalmology. The presence of a diffusing element introduces an angular diversity of the optical radiation and reduces its spatial coherence, which spreads out the energy distribution of the illumination beam in the focal plane of the eyepiece. The field of view of digitally computed retinal images can easily be increased as the eyepiece can be moved closer to the cornea to obtain a Maxwellian view of the retina without compromising ocular safety. Compliance with American and European safety standards for ophthalmic devices is more easily obtained by preventing the presence of a laser hot spot observed in front of the cornea in the absence of a scattering element. Diffuse laser illumination does not introduce any adverse effects on digitally computed laser Doppler images. ",

    "abstract": "Interfacial behaviours in multiphase systems containing H2 are crucial to underground H2 storage but are not well understood. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to study interfacial properties of the H2O+H2 and H2O+H2+silica/kerogen systems over a wide range of temperatures (298 - 523 K) and pressures (1 - 160 MPa). The combination of the H2 model with the INTERFACE force field and TIP4P/2005 H2O model can accurately predict the interfacial tensions (IFTs) from the experiment. The IFTs from simulations are also in good agreement with those from the density gradient theory coupled to the PC-SAFT equation of state. Generally, the IFTs decrease with pressure and temperature. However, at relatively high temperatures and pressures, the IFTs increase with pressure. The opposite pressure effect on IFTs can be explained by the inversion of the sign of the relative adsorption of H2. The enrichment of H2 in the interfacial regions was observed in density profiles. Meanwhile, the behaviours of contact angles (CAs) in the H2O+H2+silica system are noticeably different from those in the H2O+H2+kerogen system. The H2O CAs for the H2O+H2+silica and H2O+H2+kerogen systems increase with pressure and decrease with temperature. However, the effect of temperature and pressure on these CAs is less pronounced for the H2O+H2+silica system at low temperatures. The behaviours of CAs were understood based on the variations of IFTs in the H2O+H2 system (fluid-fluid interaction) and adhesion tensions (fluid-solid interaction). Furthermore, the analysis of the atomic density profiles shows that the presence of H2 in between the H2O droplet and the silica/kerogen surface is almost negligible. Nevertheless, the adsorption of H2O on the silica surface outside the H2O droplet is strong, while less H2O adsorption is seen on the kerogen surface. ",

The interplay between the rotating potential and TE-TM splitting of polariton modes offers a tool of control over the spin state and the angular momentum of the condensate. Specific selection rules describing the coupling of pseudospin and angular momentum are formulated. The resonant coupling between states having linear and circular polarizations leads to the polarization beats. The effect may be seen as a polariton analogy to the electronic magnetic resonance in the presence of constant and rotating magnetic fields.

    "abstract": "The spontaneous emission of light in semiconductors is due to the excitonic relaxation process. The emission of light requires a change in the transition dipole matrix of the system. This is captured in terms of the physical quantity called transition dipole moment. The transition dipole moment (TDM) characterizes the line strength of the emission process. TDM is of fundamental importance in emitter-cavity interaction as its magnitude decides the interaction strength of emitters and cavities. In all light emitting devices, the orientation of the transition dipole moments is directly related to the optical power output of the devices. In this manuscript, the basic framework of spontaneous emission and Einstein coefficients is discussed for two level systems. Semiconducting alloyed quantum dots (AQDs) are synthesized in hydrophobic phase. AQDs are used as the experimental two level system. The AQDs are then self-assembled into monolayers by the Langmuir-Schaefer method. The ensemble averaged TDM magnitude and orientation of AQDs are extracted from the time resolved and the angle resolved emission spectroscopy measurements respectively. The procedure for finding out the TDM, described in this manuscript is generalized. The mentioned procedure can be extended to any emitters in hydrophobic phase. ",

Specifically, the speed and efficiency of QC will significantly impact the Internet of Things, cryptography, finance, and marketing. Accordingly, there has been increased QC research funding from national and regional governments and private firms. However, critical concerns regarding legal, political, and business-related policies germane to QC adoption exist. Since this is an emerging and highly technical domain, most of the existing studies focus heavily on the technical aspects of QC, but our study highlights its practical and social uses cases, which are needed for the increased interest of governments. Thus, this study offers a multidisciplinary review of QC, drawing on the expertise of scholars from a wide range of disciplines whose insights coalesce into a framework that simplifies the understanding of QC, identifies possible areas of market disruption and offer empirically based recommendations that are critical for forecasting, planning, and strategically positioning QCs for accelerated diffusion.

Their low-dimensionality and crystal structure flexibility facilitate novel heterostructure growth and efficient material optimization; crucial prerequisites for accurately constructing complex multi-component quantum materials. Here, we present an extensive optimization of Sn growth on InSb, InAsSb and InAs nanowires. We demonstrate how the growth conditions and the crystal structure/symmetry of the semiconductor drive the formation of either semi-metallic $\\mathrm{\\alpha-Sn}$ or superconducting $\\mathrm{\\beta-Sn}$. For InAs nanowires, we obtain phase-pure, superconducting $\\mathrm{\\beta-Sn}$ shells.

Whether these nanowires exhibit superconductivity or not critically relies on the $\\mathrm{\\beta-Sn}$ content. Therefore, this work provides key insights into Sn phase control on a variety of semiconductors, with consequences for the yield of superconducting hybrids suitable for generating topological systems.

Our method has an expanded range of applicability for accommodating a vast variety of non-Markovian environments. We show the positivity preserving master equation for a dissipative three-level system coupled to a bosonic environment as a particular example of our general result. We illustrate the numerical simulations with an analysis explaining why the previous approximated non-Markovian master equations cannot preserve positivity.

    "abstract": "Superconductor single flux quantum (SFQ) technology is attractive for neuromorphic computing due to low energy dissipation and high, potentially up to 100 GHz, clock rates. We have recently suggested a new family of bioSFQ circuits (V.K. Semenov et al., IEEE TAS, vol. 32, no. 4, 1400105, 2022) where information is stored as a value of current in a superconducting loop and transferred as a rate of SFQ pulses propagating between the loops. This approach in the simplest case dealing with positive numbers, requires single-line transfer channels. In the more general case of bipolar numbers, it requires dual-rail transfer channels. For this need, a new comparator with dual-rail output has been developed and is presented. This comparator is an essential part of a bipolar multiplier that has also been designed, fabricated, and tested. We discuss strategic advantages of the suggested bioSFQ approach, e.g., an inherently asynchronous character of bioSFQ cells which do not require explicit clock signals. As a result, bioSFQ circuits are free of racing errors and tolerant to occasional collision of propagating SFQ pulses. This tolerance is due to stochastic nature of data signals generated by comparators operating within their gray zone. The circuits were fabricated in the eight-niobium-layer fabrication process SFQ5ee developed for superconductor electronics at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. ",

Nature, however, takes place in a non-equilibrium steady-state, so the relevance of these arguments to the natural process is unclear. Here we examine the role of intramolecular vibrations in the non-equilibrium steady-state of photosynthetic dimers in the natural scenario of incoherent light excitation. It is found that vibrations resonant with the energy difference between exciton states do not increase the quantum yield nor the imaginary part of the intersite coherence that is relevant for transport compared with non-resonant vibrations in the natural non-equilibrium steady state. That is, the vibration-electronic resonance interaction does not alter energy transport under natural incoherent-light excitation conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum scrambling describes the fast spreading of quantum information into many degrees of freedom of a many-body quantum system. This concept embraces many apparently unconnected phenomena such as the thermalization of closed quantum systems, the growth of entanglement, and the black-hole information paradox. The fastest scramblers disperse the information exponentially quickly into the system's degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) have been invented as a mean to characterize quantum scrambling. To experimentally probe OTOCs, it is necessary to reverse the sign of the many-body Hamiltonian, effectively evolving the system backwards in time, a technique that has also been shown as powerful for entanglement-enhanced metrology. However, despite experimental progress, to date no exponentially fast scrambling of quantum information has been experimentally demonstrated. Here we probe the exponential scrambling nature of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) many-body Hamiltonian. We measure an exponentially growing OTOC; moreover, we elucidate and experimentally validate the close conceptual relation between quantum information scrambling and quantum-enhanced metrology. Our experiment paves the way to the investigation of quantum chaos and scrambling in controlled tabletop experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate that entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology can be performed with general fast-scrambling Hamiltonians capable of generating entanglement exponentially quickly. ",

    "abstract": "We propose characteristic-informed neural networks (CINN), a simple and efficient machine learning approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving hyperbolic PDEs. Like physics-informed neural networks (PINN), CINN is a meshless machine learning solver with universal approximation capabilities. Unlike PINN, which enforces a PDE softly via a multi-part loss function, CINN encodes the characteristics of the PDE in a general-purpose deep neural network trained with the usual MSE data-fitting regression loss and standard deep learning optimization methods. This leads to faster training and can avoid well-known pathologies of gradient descent optimization of multi-part PINN loss functions. If the characteristic ODEs can be solved exactly, which is true in important cases, the output of a CINN is an exact solution of the PDE, even at initialization, preventing the occurrence of non-physical outputs. Otherwise, the ODEs must be solved approximately, but the CINN is still trained only using a data-fitting loss function. The performance of CINN is assessed empirically in forward and inverse linear hyperbolic problems. These preliminary results indicate that CINN is able to improve on the accuracy of the baseline PINN, while being nearly twice as fast to train and avoiding non-physical solutions. Future extensions to hyperbolic PDE systems and nonlinear PDEs are also briefly discussed. ",
