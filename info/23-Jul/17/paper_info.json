Sessile droplets were deposited onto integrated optomechanical sensors, which possess ambient-medium-noise-limited sensitivity and can thus passively sense the thermally driven acoustic spectrum of the droplets. The droplet acoustic breathing modes manifest as resonant features in the thermomechanical noise spectrum of the sensor, in some cases hybridized with the sensor's own vibrational modes. Excellent agreement is found between experimental observations and theoretical predictions, over the entire ~ 0 - 40 MHz operating range of our sensors. With suitable control over droplet size and morphology, this technique has the potential for precision acoustic sensing of small-volume biological and chemical samples. ",

Many chemical reactions are complex and fast, and existing diagnostic approaches provide incomplete information. For example, mass spectrometry is optimized to gather snapshots of the presence of many chemical species, while conventional laser spectroscopy can quantify a single chemical species through time. Here we optimize for multiple objectives by introducing a high-speed and broadband, mid-infrared dual frequency comb absorption spectrometer. The optical bandwidth of >1000 cm-1 covers absorption fingerprints of many species with spectral resolution <0.03 cm-1 to accurately discern their absolute quantities. Key to this advance are 1 GHz pulse repetition rate frequency combs covering the 3-5 um region that enable microsecond tracking of fast chemical process dynamics. We demonstrate this system to quantify the abundances and temperatures of each species in the complete reactants-to-products breakdown of 1,3,5-trioxane, which exhibits a formaldehyde decomposition pathway that is critical to modern low temperature combustion systems. By maximizing the number of observed species and improving the accuracy of temperature and concentration measurements, this spectrometer advances understanding of chemical reaction pathways and rates and opens the door for novel developments such as combining high-speed chemistry with machine learning.

    "abstract": "Solving the quantum many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is a fundamental and challenging problem in the fields of quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and material sciences. One of the common computational approaches to this problem is Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC), in which ground-state solutions are obtained by minimizing the energy of the system within a restricted family of parameterized wave functions. Deep learning methods partially address the limitations of traditional QVMC by representing a rich family of wave functions in terms of neural networks. However, the optimization objective in QVMC remains notoriously hard to minimize and requires second-order optimization methods such as natural gradient. In this paper, we first reformulate energy functional minimization in the space of Born distributions corresponding to particle-permutation (anti-)symmetric wave functions, rather than the space of wave functions. We then interpret QVMC as the Fisher--Rao gradient flow in this distributional space, followed by a projection step onto the variational manifold. This perspective provides us with a principled framework to derive new QMC algorithms, by endowing the distributional space with better metrics, and following the projected gradient flow induced by those metrics. More specifically, we propose \"Wasserstein Quantum Monte Carlo\" (WQMC), which uses the gradient flow induced by the Wasserstein metric, rather than Fisher--Rao metric, and corresponds to transporting the probability mass, rather than teleporting it. We demonstrate empirically that the dynamics of WQMC results in faster convergence to the ground state of molecular systems. ",

However, owing to the choice of a trial wave function employed in the popular hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the accurate simulation is restricted to certain classes of correlated phenomena. Herein, we combine the spin-flip (SF) formalism with the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) method via the quantum equation-of-motion (qEOM) approach to allow for an efficient simulation of a large family of strongly correlated problems. In particular, we show that the developed qEOM-SF-UCCSD/VQE method outperforms its UCCSD/VQE counterpart for simulation of the cis-trans isomerization of ethylene and the automerization of cyclobutadiene. The predicted qEOM-SF-UCCSD/VQE barrier heights for these two problems are in a good agreement with the experimentally determined values. The methodological developments presented herein will further stimulate investigation of this approach for the simulation of other types of correlated/entangled phenomena on a quantum computer. ",

We discuss a gradient-based algorithm for finding the optimal phase parameters for implementing a given unitary matrix. By increasing the number of phase layers beyond the critical value of $N+1$, the optimization consistently converges faster as the system becomes over-determined.

    "abstract": "The impulsive limit (the \"sudden approximation\") has been widely employed to describe the interaction between molecules and short, far-off-resonant laser pulses. This approximation assumes that the timescale of the laser--molecule interaction is significantly shorter than the internal rotational period of the molecule, resulting in the rotational motion being instantaneously \"frozen\" during the interaction. This simplified description of laser-molecule interaction is incorporated in various theoretical models predicting rotational dynamics of molecules driven by short laser pulses. In this theoretical work, we develop an effective theory for ultrashort laser pulses by examining the full time-evolution operator and solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation at the operator level. Our findings reveal a critical angular momentum, $l_\\mathrm{crit}$, at which the impulsive limit breaks down. In other words, the validity of the sudden approximation depends not only on the pulse duration, but also on its intensity, since the latter determines how many angular momentum states are populated. We explore both ultrashort multi-cycle (Gaussian) pulses and the somewhat less studied half-cycle pulses, which produce distinct effective potentials. We discuss the limitations of the impulsive limit and propose a new method that rescales the effective matrix elements, enabling an improved and more accurate description of laser-molecule interactions.

    "abstract": "Generation of high-fidelity amplified pulse bursts with a regular interpulse interval yields, in the spectral domain, an equidistant pattern of narrowband spectral modes, similar to frequency combs produced by cw mode-locked lasers, but with greatly increased pulse energy. Despite their great potential for nonlinear spectroscopy, material processing, etc., such long frequency-stable bursts are difficult to generate and amplify because of prominent temporal intensity modulation even after strong dispersive pulse stretching. This study presents a burst generation method based on a master-oscillator regenerative-amplifier system that allows for chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) with high scalability in pulse number. A gradual smoothing of temporal intensity profiles at an increasing number of pulses is discovered, demonstrating an unexpected recovery of the CPA performance at terahertz (THz) intraburst repetition rates. In consequence, a self-referenced stable burst spectral peak structure with megahertz (MHz) peak width is generated, without risk of amplifier damage caused by interference of chirped pulses. This result eliminates limitations in burst amplification and paves the way for advancements in ultrashort-pulse burst technology, particularly for its use in nonlinear optical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Non-destructive testing and medical diagnostic techniques using ultrasound has become indispensable in evaluating the state of materials or imaging the internal human body, respectively. To conduct spatially resolved high-quality observations, conventionally, sophisticated phased arrays are used both at the emitting and receiving ends of the setup. In comparison, single-sensor imaging techniques offer significant benefits including compact physical dimensions and reduced manufacturing expenses. However, recent advances such as compressive sensing have shown that this improvement comes at the cost of additional time-consuming dynamic spatial scanning or multi-mode mask switching, which severely hinders the quest for real-time imaging. Consequently, real-time single-sensor imaging, at low cost and simple design, still represents a demanding and largely unresolved challenge till this day. Here, we bestow on ultrasonic metasurface with both disorder and artificial intelligence (AI). The former ensures strong dispersion and highly complex scattering to encode the spatial information into frequency spectra at an arbitrary location, while the latter is used to decode instantaneously the amplitude and spectral component of the sample under investigation. Thus, thanks to this symbiosis, we demonstrate that a single fixed sensor suffices to recognize complex ultrasonic objects through the random scattered field from an unpretentious metasurface, which enables real-time and low-cost imaging, easily extendable to 3D.

The measured $CO_2$ spectra exhibit frequency shifts by approximately 11 MHz over the course of the five-hour measurement, and we show that these shifts are caused by Doppler effects due to wind along the spectrometer line of sight. The measured frequency shifts are in excellent agreement with an atmospheric model, and we show that our measurements track the wind-induced Doppler shifts with a relative frequency precision of 100 kHz (15 cm/s), equivalent to a fractional precision of a few parts in $10^{10}$.

Yet, the role of network topology for the frequency synchronization of lasers is not well understood. Here, we report our significant progress toward solving this critical problem for networks of heterogeneous laser model oscillators with repulsive coupling. We discover a general approximate principle for predicting the onset of frequency synchronization from the spectral knowledge of a complex matrix representing a combination of the signless Laplacian induced by repulsive coupling and a matrix associated with intrinsic frequency detuning. We show that the gap between the two smallest eigenvalues of the complex matrix generally controls the coupling threshold for frequency synchronization. In stark contrast with Laplacian networks, we demonstrate that local rings and all-to-all networks prevent frequency synchronization, whereas full bipartite networks have optimal synchronization properties. Beyond laser models, we show that, with a few exceptions, the spectral principle can be applied to repulsive Kuramoto networks. Our results may provide guidelines for optimal designs of scalable laser networks capable of achieving reliable synchronization. ",
