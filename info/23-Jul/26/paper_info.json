    "abstract": "According to one possible diagnosis of the quantum measurement problem, it is a consequence of quantum fundamentalism claiming that ontology and epistemology of the world are exclusively quantum, and classical physics is only an approximation. For N. Bohr, the measurement problem is a pseudo-problem because any quantum phenomenon presupposes the classical context of an experimental setup and the use of classical concepts to describe it. We consider Bohr's position from the point of view of our contextual quantum realism (CQR), inspired by the later Wittgenstein philosophy. Our approach is consistent with H. Zinkernagel's interpretation, according to which Bohr's position is not only epistemological anti-fundamentalism, but also ontological anti-fundamentalism. ",

The position is inspired by quantum mechanics and in particular the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Barad also sees similarities between her approach, N. Bohr's view and C. Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics. In our view, agential realism is a kind of ontological correlationism, not a realism. The analogy with the Bohr and Rovelli approaches is only partial. Agential realism is a wrong interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is also unsuitable for social theorizing, for which taking into account the sensitivity of ontology to the context is fundamental. As an alternative, we propose a contextual quantum realism that rejects substantive dualisms (as does Barad), but at the same time accepts the categorical dualism of the real and the ideal. Our approach also allows one to better understand Bohr's position and to correct Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics. ",

The proposed method uses an optimization algorithm to unroll a model-based qMRI reconstruction into a deep learning framework, enabling the generation of highly accurate and robust MR parameter maps at imaging acceleration. Unlike conventional deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, RELAX-MORE is a subject-specific method that can be trained on single-subject data through self-supervised learning, making it accessible and practically applicable to many qMRI studies. Using the quantitative $T_1$ mapping as an example at different brain, knee and phantom experiments, the proposed method demonstrates excellent performance in reconstructing MR parameters, correcting imaging artifacts, removing noises, and recovering image features at imperfect imaging conditions. Compared with other state-of-the-art conventional and deep learning methods, RELAX-MORE significantly improves efficiency, accuracy, robustness, and generalizability for rapid MR parameter mapping. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a new self-supervised learning method for rapid MR parameter mapping, with great potential to enhance the clinical translation of qMRI. ",

To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to experimental conditions, we utilize the self--consistent charge tight--binding density functional theory (SCC--DFTB). Through semi--classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species from carbon dioxide molecules. This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL. Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular adsorption on optical absorption properties. Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly affect the optical properties of the two--dimensional material. To analyze electron transport, we employ the open--boundary non--equilibrium Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions. The findings from our computational modeling approach might contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices. ",

The combined action of feedback, group velocity dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity leads to temporal instability with respect to perturbations at specified frequencies. We characterise the generation of new spectral bands by deriving the exact dispersion relation and we find approximate analytical expressions for the instabilities threshold and gain spectrum of modulation instability (MI). We show that, in contrast to ring-resonators, both the stationary solutions and the gain spectrum are dramatically affected by the duration of the pump pulse. We derive the extended Lugiato-Lefever equation for the Fabry-Perot resonator (FP-LLE) starting from coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations (rather than Maxwell-Bloch equations) and we compare the outcome of the stability analysis of the two models. While FP-LLE gives overall good results, we show regimes that are not captured by the mean-field limit, namely the period-two modulation instability, which may appear in highly detuned or nonlinear regimes. We report numerical simulations of the generation of MI-induced Kerr combs by solving FP-LLE and the coupled Schr\\\"odinger equations. ",

Metal oxide thin films are increasingly being used in various fields and are especially important in functional applications. They can be either p- or n-type in nature depending on the materials, dopants, and preparation route. Copper oxide is an example of a p-type metal oxide, which finds application in solar cells, photo-electrochemical cells, gas sensors, supercapacitors, and thermoelectric touch detectors. Both copper (I) and copper (II) oxides can be grown with the lower valence state oxide stable at low temperature and the higher valence state obtained by annealing at higher temperatures. In this work, we modify the optical and electrical properties of copper oxide thin films, by doping of silver through a thermal evaporation process route. Copper is thermally evaporated onto the substrate and silver is co-evaporated during this process. The films are then annealed in ambient under various conditions to obtain copper oxide. Structural and functional comparison is made between undoped and silver doped copper oxide thin films, prepared under the same conditions. Thermal evaporation is a simple route for obtaining doped metal oxides and the process can be extended to a variety of other systems as well. ",

Specifically, we demonstrate how the force can be used to control the system, and highlight the crucial role of the phase and symmetry of the force. Our work thereby provides a method to create Ising machines with arbitrary bias, extending even to exotic cases that are impossible to engineer in real spin systems. ",

We illuminate the array with light directed transverse to the cavity axis and detect photons scattered by the array into the cavity. For an array with integer-optical-wavelength spacing, in the low saturation regime, each atom Rayleigh scatters light into the cavity with nearly identical scattering amplitude, leading to an observed $N^2$ scaling of cavity photon number as the atom number increases stepwise from N = 1 to N = 8. By contrast, in an array with half-integer-wavelength spacing, the scattering amplitude for neighboring atoms is equal in magnitude but alternates in sign. Scattering from such an array yields a non-monotonic, sub-radiant cavity intensity versus N. By analyzing the polarization of light emitted from the cavity, we find that Rayleigh scattering can be collectively enhanced or suppressed with respect to Raman scattering. We observe also that atom-induced shifts and broadenings of the cavity resonance are precisely tuned by varying the atom number and positions. Altogether, deterministically loaded atom tweezer arrays provide exquisite control of atomic cavity QED spanning from the single- to the many-body regime. ",

For example, the point of resonance is of particular importance when timing the pushes onto a person sat on a swing. More sophisticatedly, so-called exceptional points have been shown to be significant in optical systems harbouring both gain and loss, as typically described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, expressly quantum points of interest -- be they exceptional points or otherwise -- arising in quantum photonic systems have been far less studied. Here we consider a paradigmatic model: a pair of coupled qubits subjected to an unbalanced ratio of gain and loss. We mark on its map several flavours of both exceptional and critical points, each of which are associated with unconventional physical responses. In particular, we uncover the points responsible for characteristic spectral features and for the sudden loss of quantum entanglement in the steady state. Our results provide perspectives for characterizing quantum photonic systems beyond effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and suggest a hierarchy of intrinsically quantum points of interest. ",

Numerical results confirm that the symmetry-enhanced circuits outperform the frequently-used parametrized circuits in the literature. ",
