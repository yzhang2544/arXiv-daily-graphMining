    "abstract": "A 218 MHz quarter wave niobium cavity has been fabricated for the purpose of demonstrating Nb3Sn technology on a low-beta accelerator cavity. Niobiumtin has been established as a promising next generation SRF material, but development has focused primarily in high-beta elliptical cell cavities. This material has a significantly higher TC than niobium, allowing for design of higher frequency quarter wave cavities (that are subsequently smaller) as well as for significantly lowered cooling requirements (possibly leading to cryocooler based designs). The fabrication, initial cold testing, and Nb3Sn coating are discussed as well as test plans and details of future applications. ",

    "abstract": "The Earth's ring current is highly dynamic and is strongly influenced by the solar wind. The ring current alters the planet's magnetic field, defining geomagnetic storms. In this study, we investigate the decay timescales of ring current protons using observations from the Van Allen Probes. Since proton fluxes typically exhibit exponential decay after big storms, the decay time scales are calculated by performing linear regression on the logarithm of the fluxes. We found that in the central region of the ring current, proton decay timescales generally increase with increasing energies and increasing L-shells. The ~10s keV proton decay timescales are about a few days, while the ~100 keV proton decay time scale is about ~10 days, and protons of 269 keV have decay timescales up to ~118 days. These findings provide valuable insights into the ring current dynamics and can contribute to the development of more accurate ring current models. ",

    "title": "Photonic chip-based low noise microwave oscillator",
    "abstract": "Numerous modern technologies are reliant on the low-phase noise and exquisite timing stability of microwave signals. Substantial progress has been made in the field of microwave photonics, whereby low noise microwave signals are generated by the down-conversion of ultra-stable optical references using a frequency comb. Such systems, however, are constructed with bulk or fiber optics and are difficult to further reduce in size and power consumption. Our work addresses this challenge by leveraging advances in integrated photonics to demonstrate low-noise microwave generation via two-point optical frequency division. Narrow linewidth self-injection locked integrated lasers are stabilized to a miniature Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity, and the frequency gap between the lasers is divided with an efficient dark-soliton frequency comb. The stabilized output of the microcomb is photodetected to produce a microwave signal at 20 GHz with phase noise of -96 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz offset frequency that decreases to -135 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset--values which are unprecedented for an integrated photonic system. All photonic components can be heterogeneously integrated on a single chip, providing a significant advance for the application of photonics to high-precision navigation, communication and timing systems.

    "abstract": "As a two-dimensional planar material with low depth profile, a metasurface can generate non-classical phase distributions for the transmitted and reflected electromagnetic waves at its interface. Thus, it offers more flexibility to control the wave front. A traditional metasurface design process mainly adopts the forward prediction algorithm, such as Finite Difference Time Domain, combined with manual parameter optimization. However, such methods are time-consuming, and it is difficult to keep the practical meta-atom spectrum being consistent with the ideal one. In addition, since the periodic boundary condition is used in the meta-atom design process, while the aperiodic condition is used in the array simulation, the coupling between neighboring meta-atoms leads to inevitable inaccuracy. In this review, representative intelligent methods for metasurface design are introduced and discussed, including machine learning, physics-information neural network, and topology optimization method. We elaborate on the principle of each approach, analyze their advantages and limitations, and discuss their potential applications. We also summarise recent advances in enabled metasurfaces for quantum optics applications. In short, this paper highlights a promising direction for intelligent metasurface designs and applications for future quantum optics research and serves as an up-to-date reference for researchers in the metasurface and metamaterial fields.

We propose a three-dimensional metamaterial with an isotropic and resonant Tellegen response in the visible frequency range. The metamaterial is formed by randomly oriented bi-material nanocylinders in a host medium. Each nanocylinder consists of a ferromagnet in a single-domain magnetic state and a high-permittivity dielectric operating near the magnetic Mie-type resonance. The proposed metamaterial requires no external magnetic bias and operates on the spontaneous magnetization of the nanocylinders. By leveraging the emerging magnetic Weyl semimetals, we further show how a giant bulk effective magnetoelectric effect can be achieved in a proposed metamaterial, exceeding that of natural materials by almost four orders of magnitude.

What conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing.

Study~1 demonstrates the application of the proposed model to bistable perception of ambiguous figures (i.e., optical illusions), exemplified by the Necker cube. While prior research has theoretically linked quantum mechanics to psychological phenomena, in Study~2 we demonstrate a viable physiological connection between physics and bistable perception. To that end, the model draws parallels between quantum tunneling of an electron through a potential energy barrier and an eye blink, an action known to trigger perceptual reversals. Finally, we discuss the ability of the model to capture diverse optical illusions and other psychological phenomena, including cognitive dissonance. ",

    "abstract": "Observation of the purely quantum mechanical effects of quasi-classical states is of utmost importance since these states are realistic sources of radiation and do not have any shortage in photon numbers. Therefore, they do not face the scalability problem as much as other single-photon sources do, which makes them much more robust against photon loss. Moreover, these states define the standard quantum limit. Hence, finding their quantum signature hints to the highest possible single-photon rate. In this manuscript, we attempt to demonstrate this idea theoretically using known dynamics and then present supporting experimental results. Through our experiment, we realize two-photon bunching from the transfer of quantum information using such states with the projection of orbital angular momentum from a continuous wave source. Our work is a step forward towards a more diverse and practical use of quasi-classical states in the domain of quantum optics and quantum information. ",
