    "title": "Optical Lossy-mode-resonance Relative Humidity Sensor on a Fiber Tip",
    "abstract": "Real-time measurement of relative humidity (RH) is important to many physical, chemical, and biological processes. However, in processes that involve harsh conditions such as high temperatures, strong electromagnetic interferences, and complex spatial constraints, conventional electrical sensors often fall short due to their intrinsic limitations. Here, we developed an optical lossy-mode-resonance (LMR) RH sensor based on the SnO2 film coated D-shaped fiber tip. Thanks to the high-temperature endurance and electromagnetic interference immunity, the developed optical fiber-tip sensor is ideal for RH sensing in critical environments, such as in the microwave drying process. Furthermore, unlike other reported in-line LMR sensors, our sensor is located at the D-shaped fiber tip with a probe-like form factor, allowing it to be readily implemented in a spatially confined environment. We have developed a custom fabrication setup for the novel D-shaped LMR fiber-tip sensor. The LMR signal from the sensor was experimentally characterized. The lossy mode resonances are understood by the finite element analysis, the results of which agree well with the experimental measurements. The fiber-tip sensor had a linear RH response between 6.1% to 75.0% and a resolution better than 4.0% RH. The fiber-tip sensor demonstrated a response time and reversibility comparable to that of commercial electrical sensors. The novel D-shaped fiber-tip LMR RH sensor developed in this work will benefit many applications that require RH monitoring in a harsh environment. Furthermore, our innovative D-shaped fiber tip design can be readily applied to LMR-based fiber sensors in general. This will allow the design's advantages of small footprint and agile maneuverability to benefit a wide range of LMR fiber sensing applications beyond RH sensing. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is a field often considered very mathematical, abstract, and unintuitive. One way some instructors are hoping to help familiarize their students with these complex topics is to have the students see quantum effects in experiments in undergraduate instructional labs. Here, we present results from an interview study about what it means to both instructors and students to see quantum effects in experiments. We focus on a popular set of quantum optics experiments, and find that students believe they are observing quantum effects and achieving related learning goals by working with these experiments. Although it is not possible to see the quantum phenomena directly with their eyes, students point out different aspects of the experiments that contribute to them observing quantum effects. This often includes seeing the experimental results, sometimes in conjunction with interacting with or understanding part of the experiment. There is additional variation across student achievement of the various related learning goals, ranging from many of the students being excited about these experiments and making a connection between the mathematical theory and the experiments to only some of the students seeing a connection between these experiments and quantum technologies. This work can help instructors consider the importance and framing of quantum experiments and raises questions about when and how in the curriculum quantum experiments can be best utilized and how to make related learning goals available to all students.

    "abstract": "Today's state of the art precision experiments in quantum, gravimetry, navigation, time keeping, and fundamental science have strict requirements on the level and spectral distribution of laser frequency noise. For example, the laser interaction with atoms and qubits requires ultra-low frequency noise at multiple offset frequencies due to hyperfine atomic transitions, motional sidebands, and fast pulse sequencing. Chip-scale integration of lasers that meet these requirements is essential for reliability, low-cost, and weight. Here, we demonstrate a significant advancement in atomic precision light sources by realizing a chip-scale, low-cost, 780 nm laser for rubidium atom applications with record-low 640 mHz (white noise floor at 0.2 Hz$^2$/Hz) fundamental and 732 Hz integral linewidths and a frequency noise that is multiple orders of magnitude lower than previous hybrid and heterogeneous self-injection locked 780 nm lasers and lower noise than bulk microresonator implementations. The laser is a Fabry-P\\'erot laser diode self-injection locked to an ultra-high Q photonic integrated silicon nitride resonator. This performance is enabled by a 145 million resonator Q with a 30 dB extinction ratio, the highest Q at 780 nm, to the best of our knowledge. We analyze the impact of our frequency noise on specific atomic applications including atomic frequency references, Rydberg quantum gates, and cold atom gravimeters. The photonic integrated resonator is fabricated using a CMOS foundry-compatible, wafer-scale process, with demonstrated integration of other components showing promise for a full system-on-a-chip. This performance is scalable to other visible atomic wavelengths, opening the door to a variety of transitions across many atomic species and enabling low-power, compact, ultra-low noise lasers impacting applications including quantum sensing, computing, clocks and more.

    "abstract": "In this work, a near-wall model, which couples the inverse of a recently developed compressible velocity transformation [Griffin, Fu, & Moin, PNAS, 118:34, 2021] and an algebraic temperature-velocity relation, is developed for high-speed turbulent boundary layers. As input, the model requires the mean flow state at one wall-normal height in the inner layer of the boundary layer and at the boundary-layer edge. As output, the model can predict mean temperature and velocity profiles across the entire inner layer, as well as the wall shear stress and heat flux. The model is tested in an a priori sense using a wide database of direct numerical simulation high-Mach-number turbulent channel flows, pipe flows, and boundary layers (48 cases with edge Mach numbers in the range of 0.77--11 and semi-local friction Reynolds numbers in the range of 170--5700). The present model is significantly more accurate than the classical ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for all cases tested. The model is deployed as a wall model for large-eddy simulations in channel flows with bulk Mach numbers in the range of 0.7--4 and friction Reynolds numbers in the range of 320--1800. When compared to the classical framework, in the a posteriori sense, the present method greatly improves the predicted heat flux, wall stress, and temperature and velocity profiles, especially in cases with strong heat transfer. In addition, the present model solves one ODE instead of two and has a similar computational cost and implementation complexity as the commonly used ODE model. ",

Acoustic emission (AE) during filamentation opens a door to give the insight into the dynamic evolution of filaments in air. In particular, the frequency features of the acoustic emission provide relevant information on the conversion of laser energy to acoustic energy. Here, the acoustic emission of femtosecond laser filament manipulated by energy and the focal lengths was measured quantitatively by a broadband microphone, and the acoustic parameters were compared and analyzed. Our results showed that the acoustic power presents a squared dependence on the laser energy and the bandwidth of the acoustic spectrum showed a significant positive correlation with laser energy deposition. It was found that the spectrum of the acoustic pulse emitted from the middle of the filament has a larger bandwidth compared to those emitted from the ends of the filament and the spectrum of the acoustic pulse is also an indicator of the filament intensity distribution. These findings are helpful for studying the plasma filament properties and complex dynamic processes through acoustic parameters and allow the optimization of remote applications. ",

    "abstract": "Active microelectromechanical systems can couple the nanomechanical domain with the electronic domain by integrating electronic sensing and actuation mechanisms into the micromechanical device. This enables very fast and sensitive measurements of force, acceleration, or the presence of biological analytes. In particular, strain sensors integrated onto MEMS cantilevers are widely used to transduce an applied force to an electrically measurable signal in applications like atomic force microscopy, mass sensing, or molecular detection. However, the high Young's moduli of traditional cantilever materials (silicon or silicon nitride) limit the thickness of the devices, and therefore the deflection sensitivity that can be obtained for a specific spring constant. Using softer materials such as polymers as the structural material of the MEMS device would overcome this problem. However, these materials are incompatible with high-temperature fabrication processes often required to fabricate high quality electronic strain sensors. We introduce a pioneering solution that seamlessly integrates the benefits of polymer MEMS technology with the remarkable sensitivity of strain sensors, even under high-temperature deposition conditions. Cantilevers made using this technology are inherently fluid compatible and have shown up to 6 times lower force noise than their conventional counterparts. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of this polymer/ceramic/semiconductor multi-layer fabrication approach with the examples of self-sensing AFM cantilevers, and membrane surface stress sensors for biomolecule detection.

Although only two simulations are required in each iteration of this optimization process, these simulations still make up the vast majority of the necessary computations, and render the design of complex devices with large footprints computationally infeasible. Here, we introduce a multi-faceted factorization caching approach to drastically simplify the underlying computations in finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) simulations, and significantly reduce the time required for device optimization. Specifically, we cache the symbolic and numerical factorizations for the solution of the corresponding system of linear equations in discretized FDFD simulations, and re-use them throughout the entire device design process. As proof-of-concept demonstrations of the resulting computational advantage, we present simulation speedups reaching as high as $9.2\\times$ in the design of broadband wavelength and mode multiplexers compared to conventional FDFD methods. We also show that factorization caching scales well over a broad range of footprints independent of the device geometry, from as small as $16{\\mu m}^2$ to over $7000 {\\mu m}^2$.

The main challenge lies in modeling the interaction between excitations of different nature, namely bosonic excitations (the plasmonic ISB excitations) with fermionic excitations (the electrons within the extraction or injection subband). In this work, we introduce a comprehensive quantum framework that encompasses both the ISB plasmonic mode and the extractor/injector mode, with a specific emphasis on accurately describing the coherent nature of transport. This reveals inherent selection rules dictating the interaction between the ISB plasmon and the extraction/injection subband. To incorporate the dynamics of the system, this framework is combined to a density matrix model and a quantum master equation which have the key property to distinguish intra and intersubband mechanisms. These theoretical developments are confronted to experimental photocurrent measurements from midinfrared quantum cascade detectors (${\\lambda}$ = 10 ${\\mu}$m) embedded in metal-semiconductor-metal microcavities, operating at the onset of the strong light-matter coupling regime (2${\\Omega}$ = 9.3 meV). We are able to reproduce quantitatively the different features of the photocurrent spectra, notably the relative amplitude evolution of the polaritonic peaks with respect to the voltage bias applied to the structure. These results on extraction allow us to elucidate the possibility to effectively inject electronic excitations into ISB plasmonic states, and thus polaritonic states. ",

    "title": "Exploring the Potential of Integrated Optical Sensing and Communication  (IOSAC) Systems with Si Waveguides for Future Networks",
    "abstract": "Advanced silicon photonic technologies enable integrated optical sensing and communication (IOSAC) in real time for the emerging application requirements of simultaneous sensing and communication for next-generation networks. Here, we propose and demonstrate the IOSAC system on the silicon nitride (SiN) photonics platform. The IOSAC devices based on microring resonators are capable of monitoring the variation of analytes, transmitting the information to the terminal along with the modulated optical signal in real-time, and replacing bulk optics in high-precision and high-speed applications. By directly integrating SiN ring resonators with optical communication networks, simultaneous sensing and optical communication are demonstrated by an optical signal transmission experimental system using especially filtering amplified spontaneous emission spectra. The refractive index (RI) sensing ring with a sensitivity of 172 nm/RIU, a figure of merit (FOM) of 1220, and a detection limit (DL) of 8.2*10-6 RIU is demonstrated. Simultaneously, the 1.25 Gbps optical on-off-keying (OOK) signal is transmitted at the concentration of different NaCl solutions, which indicates the bit-error-ratio (BER) decreases with the increase in concentration. The novel IOSAC technology shows the potential to realize high-performance simultaneous biosensing and communication in real time and further accelerate the development of IoT and 6G networks. ",

    "abstract": "A BEC interacting with an optical field via a feedback mirror can be a realisation of the quantum Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, a paradigmatic model of long-range interactions in quantum systems. We demonstrate that the self-structuring instability displayed by an initially uniform BEC can evolve as predicted by the quantum HMF model, displaying quasiperiodic \"chevron\" dynamics for strong driving. For weakly driven self-structuring, the BEC and optical field behave as a two-state quantum system, regularly oscillating between a spatially uniform state and a spatially periodic state. It also predicts the width of stable optomechanical droplets and the dependence of droplet width on optical pump intensity. The results presented suggest that optical diffraction-mediated interactions between atoms in a BEC may be a route to experimental realisation of quantum HMF dynamics and a useful analogue for studying quantum systems involving long-range interactions.

    "abstract": "The melting curve of pure silica (SiO$_2$) was determined using {\\it ab initio} density functional theory together with the solid-liquid coexistence approach, thermodynamic integration and the Z method. The melting curves show a smooth slow increase in a large region from 50 GPa (dT/dP $\\approx$ 10 K/GPa) to about 500 GPa (dT/dP $\\approx$ 6 K/GPa) without any abrupt changes at around 120 GPa and 300 GPa as seen in some recent experimental and computational studies. The topography of the melting curve above 50 GPa is consistent with a gradual change in the distribution of the Si coordination numbers in the liquid state and the absence of large changes in the density following solid-solid phase transitions. The pair distribution functions show that the structural correlation in the liquid is mainly short-ranged and that the Si-O bond is stiff. The densification of the melt structure with pressure above 50 GPa is therefore due to an increase in 7- and 8-fold coordinated silicon. ",

    "title": "Quantum noise dynamics in nonlinear pulse propagation",
    "abstract": "The propagation of ultrafast pulses in dispersion-engineered waveguides, exhibiting strong field confinement in both space and time, is a promising avenue towards single-photon nonlinearities in an all-optical platform. However, quantum engineering in such systems requires new numerical tools and physical insights to harness their complicated multimode and nonlinear quantum dynamics. In this work, we use a self-consistent, multimode Gaussian-state model to capture the nonlinear dynamics of broadband quantum fluctuations and correlations, including entanglement. Notably, despite its parametrization by Gaussian states, our model exhibits nonlinear dynamics in both the mean field and the quantum correlations, giving it a marked advantage over conventional linearized treatments of quantum noise, especially for systems exhibiting gain saturation and strong nonlinearities. Numerically, our approach takes the form of a Gaussian split-step Fourier (GSSF) method, naturally generalizing highly efficient SSF methods used in classical ultrafast nonlinear optics; the equations for GSSF evaluate in $O(M^2\\log M)$ time for an $M$-mode system with $O(M^2)$ quantum correlations. To demonstrate the broad applicability of GSSF, we numerically study quantum noise dynamics and multimode entanglement in several ultrafast systems, from canonical soliton propagation in third-order ($\\chi^{(3)}$) waveguides to saturated $\\chi^{(2)}$ broadband parametric generation and supercontinuum generation, e.g., as recently demonstrated in thin-film lithium niobate nanophotonics.
