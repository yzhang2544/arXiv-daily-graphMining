    "abstract": "Solving multiphysics-based inverse problems for geological carbon storage monitoring can be challenging when multimodal time-lapse data are expensive to collect and costly to simulate numerically. We overcome these challenges by combining computationally cheap learned surrogates with learned constraints. Not only does this combination lead to vastly improved inversions for the important fluid-flow property, permeability, it also provides a natural platform for inverting multimodal data including well measurements and active-source time-lapse seismic data. By adding a learned constraint, we arrive at a computationally feasible inversion approach that remains accurate. This is accomplished by including a trained deep neural network, known as a normalizing flow, which forces the model iterates to remain in-distribution, thereby safeguarding the accuracy of trained Fourier neural operators that act as surrogates for the computationally expensive multiphase flow simulations involving partial differential equation solves. By means of carefully selected experiments, centered around the problem of geological carbon storage, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed constrained optimization method on two different data modalities, namely time-lapse well and time-lapse seismic data. While permeability inversions from both these two modalities have their pluses and minuses, their joint inversion benefits from either, yielding valuable superior permeability inversions and CO2 plume predictions near, and far away, from the monitoring wells.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has stimulated a wide range of medical image-based diagnosis and treatment in fields such as cardiology and ophthalmology. Such applications can be further facilitated by deep learning-based super-resolution technology, which improves the capability of resolving morphological structures. However, existing deep learning-based method only focuses on spatial distribution and disregard frequency fidelity in image reconstruction, leading to a frequency bias. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frequency-aware super-resolution framework that integrates three critical frequency-based modules (i.e., frequency transformation, frequency skip connection, and frequency alignment) and frequency-based loss function into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We conducted a large-scale quantitative study from an existing coronary OCT dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over existing deep learning frameworks. In addition, we confirmed the generalizability of our framework by applying it to fish corneal images and rat retinal images, demonstrating its capability to super-resolve morphological details in eye imaging.

    "abstract": "Polarization modulators have a broad range of applications in optics. The acceptance angle of a free-space polarization modulator is crucial for many applications. Polarization modulators that can achieve a wide acceptance angle are constructed by attaching a piezoelectric transducer to an isotropic material, and utilize a resonant transverse interaction between light and acoustic waves. Since their demonstration in the 1960s, the design of these modulators has essentially remained the same with minor improvements in the following decades. In this work, we show that a suitable single crystal with the correct crystal orientation, functioning as both the piezoelectric transducer and the acousto-optic interaction medium, could be used for constructing a highly efficient free-space resonant polarization modulator operating at megahertz frequencies and exhibiting a wide acceptance angle. We construct the modulator using gallium arsenide, an optically isotropic and piezoelectric crystal, and demonstrate polarization modulation at 6 MHz with an input aperture of 1 cm in diameter, acceptance angle reaching $\\pm30^\\circ$, and modulation efficiency exceeding 50%. Compared to state-of-the-art resonant photoelastic modulators, the modulator reported in this work exhibits greater than 50 fold improvement in modulation frequency for the same input aperture, while simultaneously reducing the thickness by approximately a factor of 80. Increasing the modulation frequency of photoelastic modulators from the kilohertz to the megahertz regime and substantially reducing their thickness lead to significant performance improvements for various use cases. This technological advancement also creates opportunities for utilizing these devices in new applications. ",

    "abstract": "Energy harvesting is essential for the internet-of-things networks where a tremendous number of sensors require power. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs), especially those based on silicon (Si), are a promising source of clean and sustainable energy for these sensors. However, the reported performance of planar-type Si TEGs never exceeded power factors of 0.1 ${\\mu} Wcm^{-2} K^{-2}$ due to the poor thermoelectric performance of Si and the suboptimal design of the devices. Here, we report a planar-type Si TEG with a power factor of 1.3 ${\\mu} Wcm^{-2} K^{-2}$ around room temperature. The increase in thermoelectric performance of Si by nanostructuring based on the phonon-glass electron-crystal concept and optimized three-dimensional heat-guiding structures resulted in a significant power factor. In-field testing demonstrated that our Si TEG functions as a 100-${\\mu}W$-class harvester. This result is an essential step toward energy harvesting with a low-environmental load and cost-effective material with high throughput, a necessary condition for energy-autonomous sensor nodes for the trillion sensors universe.

    "abstract": "Spin preparation prior to a free-induction-decay (FID) measurement can be adversely affected by transverse bias fields, particularly in the geophysical field range. A strategy that enhances the spin polarization accumulated before readout is demonstrated, by synchronizing optical pumping with a magnetic field pulse that supersedes any transverse fields by over two order of magnitude. The pulsed magnetic field is generated along the optical pumping axis using a compact electromagnetic coil pair encompassing a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) vapor cell. The coils also resistively heat the cesium (Cs) vapor to the optimal atomic density without spurious magnetic field contributions as they are rapidly demagnetized to approximately zero field during spin readout. The demagnetization process is analyzed electronically, and directly with a FID measurement, to confirm that the residual magnetic field is minimal during detection. The sensitivity performance of this technique is compared to existing optical pumping modalities across a wide magnetic field range. A noise floor sensitivity of $238\\,\\mathrm{fT/\\surd{Hz}}$ was achieved in a field of approximately $\\mathrm{50\\,\\mu{T}}$, in close agreement with the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) predicted noise density of $258\\,\\mathrm{fT/\\surd{Hz}}$.

The challenge of nanostructuring the inert metal-oxide is resolved by direct soft nanoimprint lithography with sol-gel derived barium titanate enabling critical dimensions of 120 nm with aspect ratios of 5. The nanohole array exhibits a photonic bandgap in the infrared range when probed along the slab axis while lattice resonant states are observed in out-of-plane transmission configuration. The enhanced light-matter interaction from the resonant structure enables to increase the second-harmonic generation in the near-UV by a factor of 18 illustrating the potential in the flexible fabrication technique for barium titanate photonic devices.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear frequency mixing is of critical importance in extending the wavelength range of optical sources. It is also indispensable for emerging applications such as quantum information and photonic signal processing. Conventional lithium niobate with periodic poling is the most widely used device for frequency mixing due to the strong second-order nonlinearity. The recent development of nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides promises improvements of nonlinear efficiencies by orders of magnitude with sub-wavelength optical conferment. However, the intrinsic nanoscale inhomogeneity in nanophotonic lithium niobate limits the coherent interaction length, leading to low nonlinear efficiencies. Therefore, the performance of nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides is still far behind conventional counterparts. Here, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate ultra-efficient second order nonlinearity in nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides significantly outperforming conventional crystals. This is realized by developing the adapted poling approach to eliminate the impact of nanoscale inhomogeneity in nanophotonic lithium niobate waveguides. We realize overall secondharmonic efficiency near 10^4 %/W without cavity enhancement, which saturates the theoretical limit. Phase-matching bandwidths and temperature tunability are improved through dispersion engineering. The ideal square dependence of the nonlinear efficiency on the waveguide length is recovered. We also break the trade-off between the energy conversion ratio and pump power. A conversion ratio over 80% is achieved in the single-pass configuration with pump power as low as 20 mW. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning--based anomaly detection (AD) methods are promising tools for extending the coverage of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). One class of AD methods that has received significant attention is resonant anomaly detection, where the BSM is assumed to be localized in at least one known variable. While there have been many methods proposed to identify such a BSM signal that make use of simulated or detected data in different ways, there has not yet been a study of the methods' complementarity. To this end, we address two questions. First, in the absence of any signal, do different methods pick the same events as signal-like? If not, then we can significantly reduce the false-positive rate by comparing different methods on the same dataset. Second, if there is a signal, are different methods fully correlated? Even if their maximum performance is the same, since we do not know how much signal is present, it may be beneficial to combine approaches. Using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Olympics dataset, we provide quantitative answers to these questions. We find that there are significant gains possible by combining multiple methods, which will strengthen the search program at the LHC and beyond. ",
