    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of quantum hardware brings a host of research opportunities and the potential for quantum advantages across numerous fields. In this landscape, quantum circuit simulations serve as an indispensable tool by emulating quantum behavior on classical computers. They offer easy access, noise-free environments, and real-time observation of quantum states. However, the sustainability aspect of quantum circuit simulation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of environmental impact from quantum circuit simulation. We present a preliminary model to compute the CO2e emissions derived from quantum circuit simulations. Our results indicate that large quantum circuit simulations (43 qubits) could lead to CO2e emissions 48 times greater than training a transformer machine learning model. ",

    "abstract": "Moir\\'e structures are receiving increasing attention in nanophotonics as they support intriguing optical phenomena. In the so-called \"magic configuration\", one-dimensional moir\\'es give rise to fully dispersionless energy bands known as \"flatbands\", where the light is tightly localized within each supercell of the periodic moir\\'e. The goal of this investigation is to determine to what extent the confinement of light, observed in periodic structures, is preserved in microcavities of finite size. Here we analyze the optical response of finite moir\\'e structures consisting of one, two, or more supercells of 1D moir\\'e. Our calculations reveal that for single-supercell cavity, the magic configuration does not impact the electric field confinement at the wavelength of the flat band modes. However, when three or more supercells are connected, we show that the coupling between supercells is canceled at the \"magic configuration\", resulting in highly confined modes with a quality factor greater than $10^6$ and exhibiting the characteristics of a quasi-bound state in the continuum where optical losses are eliminated through a destructive interference process.

    "abstract": "Laser Light Scattering (LLS) method, combined with a long-distance microscope was utilized to detect micrometer-sized particles on a smooth substrate. LLS was capable to detect individual particle release, shrink, or fragmentation during exposure to a plasma or a gas jet. In-situ monitoring of hundreds of particles was carried out to investigate the effect of hydrogen plasma exposure on particle adhesion, morphology, and composition. LLS was calibrated with monodisperse melamine resin spheres with known sizes of 2.14 um, 2.94 um, and 5.26 um in diameter. The lowest achievable noise level of approximately 3% was demonstrated for counting 5.26 um spherical melamine particles. The accuracy for melamine particle size measurements ranged from 50% for 2.14 um particles to 10% for 5.26 um particles. This scatter was taken as the imprecision of the method. Size distribution for polydisperse particles with known refractive index was obtained by interpolating to an effective scattering cross-section of a sphere using Mie theory. While the Abbe diffraction limit was about 2 um in our system, the detection limit for Si particles in LLS according to Mie approximation was assessed to about 3 um, given the limitations of the laser flux, microscope resolution, camera noise, and particle composition. Additionally, the gradual changes in forward scattering cross-sections for Si particles during the exposure to the hydrogen plasma were consistent with Si etching reported in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "Double Nanohole Plasmonic Tweezers (DNH) have revolutionized particle trapping capabilities, enabling trapping of nanoscale particles well beyond the diffraction limit. This advancement allows for the low-power trapping of extremely small particles, such as 20 nm nanoparticles and individual proteins. However, to mitigate the potentially amplified effects of plasmonic heating at resonance illumination, DNH plasmonic tweezers are typically operated under off-resonance conditions.Consequently, this results in a decrease in optical forces and electric field enhancement within the plasmonic hotspot, which is undesirable for applications that require enhanced light-matter interaction like Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). In this study, we present a novel design for DNH plasmonic tweezers that addresses these limitations and provides significantly higher field enhancements. By introducing a reflector layer, on-resonance illumination can be achieved while significantly reducing plasmonic heating.This reflector layer facilitates efficient dissipation of heat both in-plane and axially. Furthermore, the integration of a reflector layer enables a redistribution of hotspots via Maxwell's boundary conditions for metals, creating more accessible hotspots optimal for applications that require enhanced light-matter interaction. We also demonstrate low-power trapping of small extracellular vesicles using our novel design, thereby opening possibilities for applications such as SERS and single photon emission that require intense light-matter interaction.

    "abstract": "Shape-morphing structures possess the ability to change their shapes from one state to another, and therefore, offer great potential for a broad range of applications. A typical paradigm of morphing is transforming from an initial two-dimensional (2D) flat configuration into a three-dimensional (3D) target structure. One popular fabrication method for these structures involves programming cuts in specific locations of a thin sheet material (i.e.~kirigami), forming a desired 3D shape upon application of external mechanical load. In this paper, a novel inverse design strategy is proposed by modifying the bending stiffness via introducing distributed modulus in functionally graded composites (FGCs). The longitudinal modulus of each cross-sectional slice can be controlled through the rule of mixtures, hence matching the required modulus distribution along the elastic strip. Following the proposed framework, a diverse range of structures is obtained with different Gaussian curvatures in both numerical simulations and experiments. A very good agreement is achieved between the measured shapes of morphed structures and the targets. In addition, the compressive rigidity and specific energy absorption during compression of FGC-based hemi-ellipsoidal morphing structures with various aspect ratios were also examined numerically and validated against experiments. By conducting systematical numerical simulations, we also demonstrate the multifunctionality of the modulus-graded shape-morphing composites. This new inverse design framework provides an opportunity to create shape-morphing structures by utilising modulus-graded composite materials, which can be employed in a variety of applications involving multi-physical environments. Furthermore, this framework underscores the versatility of the approach, enabling precise control over material properties at a local level. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present numerical investigations on a large Zeeman manifold in an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) medium, focusing on the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb as our model system. We examine two distinct models comprising 13 and 16 energy levels, respectively, using pump-probe spectroscopy with varying polarization of the light fields. A longitudinal magnetic field is used, and the ellipticity of both light fields is varied with the constraint that both lights have orthogonal polarization. We discover that in the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field, the change in ellipticity of light polarization induces optical anisotropy. This anisotropy results from the uneven distribution of population among the ground Zeeman levels, leading to the absorption of weak probe light. For a large number of states interacting with different field components, the existence of a steady state depends upon the multi-photon resonance and phase matching conditions. A comment is made on why such conditions are not required in our model, and the assumptions and limitations of the model are also discussed. To validate our numerical findings, we perform experimental measurements at two different magnetic field strengths in the D2 line of 87 Rb. The experimental results align well with our numerical simulations. Specifically, we conclude that the probe transmission spectra at lower magnetic field values (up to 20 G) exhibit similarity for both the D1 and D2 lines of 87 Rb, effectively described by the 13-level model. However, at higher magnetic field values, a more complicated 16-level (or higher) system is necessary to accurately capture the response of the probe in D2 line. ",

Simultaneously we are able measure the distance between micro-cell and the interrogating system by means of time-of-flight measurements, thus correlating between position and magnetic field. Consequently, we provide a novel toolset to measure and map arbitrary, remote, and hard to access magnetic field in unshielded environments with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, paving the way to a variety of novel applications in diverse fields such as medicine, communication, defense, space-exploration, and quantum technologies.

    "abstract": "The new generation of laser-based solid-state lighting (SSL) white light sources requires new material systems capable of withstanding, diffusing and converting high intensity laser light. State-of-the-art systems use a blue light emitting diode (LED) or laser diode (LD) in combination with color conversion materials, such as yellow emitting Ce-doped phosphors or red and green emitting quantum dots (QD), to produce white light. However, for laser-based high-brightness illumination in particular, thermal management is a major challenge, and in addition, a light diffuser is required to diffuse the highly focused laser beam. Here, we present a hybrid material system that simultaneously enables efficient, uniform light distribution and color conversion of a blue LD, while ensuring good thermal management even at high laser powers of up to 5W. A highly open porous (> 99%) framework structure of hollow SiO$_2$ microtubes is utilized as an efficient light diffuser that can drastically reduce speckle contrast. By further functionalizing the microtubes with halide perovskite QDs (SiO$_2$@CsPbBr$_3$ as model system) color conversion from UV to visible light is achieved. Under laser illumination, the open porous structure prevents heat accumulation and thermal quenching of the QDs. By depositing an ultrathin (~ 5.5 nm) film of poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate) (pEGDMA) via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD), the luminescent stability of the QDs against moisture is enhanced. The demonstrated hybrid material system paves the way for the design of advanced and functional laser light diffusers and converters that can meet the challenges associated with laser-based SSL applications.

Long range and compatibility with data traffic make it unique to the exploration of remote regions, as well as highly-populated areas where optical networks are pervasive, and its large-scale implementation is attractive for both Earth scientists and telecom operators. However, validation and modeling of its response and sensitivity are still at an early stage and suffer from lack of statistically-significant event catalogs and limited availability of co-located seismometers. We implemented laser interferometry on a land-based telecommunication cable and analyzed 1.5 years of continuous acquisition, with successful detections of events in a broad range of magnitudes, including very weak ones. By comparing fiber and seismometer recordings we determined relations between a cable's detection probability and the magnitude and distance of events, and showed that spectral analysis of recorded data allows considerations on the earthquake dynamics. Our results reveal that quantitative analysis is possible for this sensing technique and support the interpretation of data from the growing amount of interferometric deployments. We anticipate the high integration and scalability of laser interferometry into existing telecommunication grids to be useful for the daily seismicity monitoring, in perspective exploitable for civilian protection use.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the unknown spectrum of a given X-ray source is a common problem in a wide range of X-ray imaging tasks. For high-energy sources, transmission measurements are mostly used to recover the X-ray spectrum, as a solution to an inverse problem. While this inverse problem is usually under-determined, ill-posedness can be reduced by improving the choice of transmission measurements. A recently proposed approach optimizes custom thicknesses of calibration materials used to generate transmission measurements, employing a genetic algorithm to minimize the condition number of the system matrix before inversion. In this paper, we generalize the proposed approach to multiple calibration materials and show a much larger decrease of the condition number of the system matrix than thickness-only optimization. Additionally, the spectrum reconstruction pipeline is tested in a simulation study with a challenging high-energy Bremsstrahlung X-ray source encountered in Linear Induction Accelerators (LIA), with strong scatter noise. Using this approach, a realistic noise level is obtained on measurements. A generic anti-scatter grid is designed to reduce noise to an acceptable -- yet still high -- noise range. A novel noise-robust reconstruction method is then presented, which shows much less sensitive to initialization than common expectation-maximization approaches, enables a precise choice of spectrum resolution and a controlled injection of prior knowledge of the X-ray spectrum.

    "abstract": "Quantum communication is based on the generation of quantum states and exploitation of quantum resources for communication protocols. Currently, photons are considered as the optimal carrier of information, because they enable long-distance transition with resilience to decoherence, and they are relatively easy to create and detect. Entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum communication and information processing, and it is of particular importance for quantum repeaters [1]. Hyperentanglement [2], a state where parties are entangled with two or more degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides an important additional resource because it increases data rates and enhances error resilience. However, in photonics, the channel capacity, i.e. the ultimate throughput, is fundamentally limited when dealing with linear elements. We propose a technique for achieving higher transmission rates for quantum communication by using hyperentangled states, based on multiplexing multiple DoFs on a single photon, transmitting the photon, and eventually demultiplexing the DoFs to different photons at the destination, using a Bell state measurement. Following our scheme, one can generate two entangled qubit pairs by sending only a single photon. The proposed transmission scheme lays the groundwork for novel quantum communication protocols with higher transmission rate and refined control over scalable quantum technologies. ",

    "abstract": "Atomic high-precision measurements have become a competitive and essential technique for tests of fundamental physics, the Standard Model, and our theory of gravity. It is therefore self-evident that such measurements call for a consistent relativistic description of atoms that eventually originates from quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics. Most quantum-metrological approaches even postulate effective field-theoretical treatments to describe a precision enhancement through techniques like squeezing. However, a consistent derivation of interacting atomic quantum gases from an elementary quantum field theory that includes both the internal structure as well as the center of mass of atoms, has not yet been addressed. We present such an effective quantum field theory for interacting, spin-carrying, and possibly charged ensembles of atoms composed of nucleus and electron that form composite bosons called cobosons, where the interaction with light is included in a multipolar description. Relativistic corrections to the energy of a single coboson, light-matter interaction, and the scattering potential between cobosons arise in a consistent and natural manner. In particular, we obtain a relativistic coupling between the coboson's center-of-mass motion and internal structure encoded by the mass defect, together with an ion spin-orbit coupling. We use these results to derive modified bound-state energies including the motion of ions, modified scattering potentials, a relativistic extension of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the mass defect applicable to atomic clocks or quantum-clock interferometry. Our theory does not only combine and generalize aspects of effective field theories, quantum optics, scattering theory, and ultracold quantum gases, but it also bridges the gap between quantum electrodynamics and effective field theories for ultracold quantum gases.

    "title": "Practical quantum imaging with undetected photons",
    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) imaging is invaluable across many scientific disciplines, from material analysis to diagnostic medicine. However, applications are often limited by detector cost, resolution and sensitivity, noise caused by the thermal IR background, and the cost, portability and tunability of infrared sources. Here, we describe a compact, portable, and low-cost system that is able to image objects at IR wavelengths without an IR source or IR detector. This imaging with undetected photons (IUP) approach uses quantum interference and correlations between entangled photon pairs to transfer image information from the IR to the visible, where it can be detected with a standard silicon camera. We also demonstrate a rapid analysis approach to acquire both phase and transmission image information. These developments provide an important step towards making IUP a commercially viable technique. ",
