    "title": "Equivalent near-field corner frequency analysis of 3D dynamic rupture  simulations reveals source complexity",
    "abstract": "Dynamic rupture simulations generate synthetic waveforms that account for non-linear source, path, and site complexity. Here, we analyze millions of spatially dense waveforms from 3D dynamic rupture simulations in a novel way to illuminate the spectral fingerprints of earthquake physics. We define a Brune-type equivalent near-field corner frequency ($f_c$) to analyze the spatial variability of ground motion spectra and unravel their link to source complexity. We first investigate a simple 3D strike-slip setup, including an asperity and a barrier, and illustrate basic relations between source properties and $f_c$ variations. Next, we analyze > 13,000,000 synthetic near-field strong motion waveforms generated in three high-resolution dynamic rupture simulations of real earthquakes, namely, the $M_w$ 7.1 2019 Ridgecrest mainshock, the $M_w$ 6.4 Searles Valley foreshock, and the $M_w$ 7.3 1992 Landers earthquake. All scenarios consider 3D fault geometries, topography, off-fault plasticity, viscoelastic attenuation, 3D velocity structure, and resolve frequencies up to 1-2 Hz. Our analysis reveals pronounced and localized patterns of elevated $f_c$, specifically in the vertical components. We validate such $f_c$ variability in observed near-fault spectra. Using isochrone analysis, we identify the complex dynamic mechanisms that explain the rays of elevated $f_c$ and cause unexpectedly impulsive, localized, vertical ground motions. While the vertical high frequencies are also associated with path effects, rupture directivity, and coalescence of multiple rupture fronts, we show that they are dominantly caused by rake-rotated surface-breaking rupture fronts that decelerate due to fault heterogeneities or geometric complexity. Our findings highlight the potential of spatially dense ground motion observations for furthering our understanding of earthquake physics directly from near-field data. ",

    "abstract": "Ultrabroadband electro-optic sampling with few-cycle optical pulses is known to be an extremely sensitive technique to detect electric field amplitudes. By combining this method with dual-comb spectroscopy and with a new class of ultrafast lasers, we perform high-resolution (<10 MHz, 0.0003 wavenumbers) spectroscopic measurements across the whole frequency range of 1.5 to 45 THz (6.6-200 microns) with an instantaneous spectral coverage exceeding an octave (e.g., 9-22 microns). As a driving source, we use a pair of highly mutually-coherent low-noise frequency combs centered at 2.35 microns produced by mode-locked solid-state Cr: ZnS lasers. One of the two combs is frequency downconverted via intrapulse difference frequency generation to produce a molecular sensing comb, while the second comb is frequency doubled to produce a near-IR comb for electro-optic sampling (EOS). An ultra-low intensity and phase noise of our dual-comb system allows capturing a vast amount of longwave spectral information (>200,000 comb-mode spectral lines) at up to a video rate of 69 Hz and with the high dynamic range limited by the shot noise of the near-IR EOS balanced detection. Our long-wavelength IR measurements with low-pressure gases: ethanol, isoprene, and dimethyl sulfide reveal spectroscopic features that had never been explored before. ",

    "abstract": "Phased array transducers can shape acoustic fields for versatile manipulation, however, generating multiple foci typically requires complex optimization. In this study, we show that Dammann gratings - binary phase gratings used in optics to generate arrays of equal intensity spots - can be adapted for acoustics to produce multiple equal strength foci using a phased array transducer. The transducer elements were assigned phases of 0 or pi based on a Dammann grating defined by transition points. Simulations results show that simple gratings with two transition points can generate fields with up to 12 foci with nearly equal acoustic pressures. Compared to conventional multi focus phase optimization techniques, the Dammann grating approach is computationally efficient and enables facile reconfiguration of the focal pattern by adjusting the single focus or grating hologram. This study demonstrates that adapting binary phase functions from photonics can expand the capabilities of ultrasound for versatile acoustic manipulation tasks that require parallel actuation at multiple points.

Combining the amplification provided by the active circuit and the nonreciprocity supported by the cavity magnonics, we implement a nonreciprocal amplifier with the functions of both unidirectional amplification and reverse isolation. The microwave signal is amplified by 11.5 dB in the forward propagating direction and attenuated in the reverse direction by -34.7 dB, giving an isolation ratio of 46.2 dB. Such a unidirectional amplifier can be readily employed in quantum technologies, where the device can simultaneously amplify the weak signal output by the quantum system and isolate the sensitive quantum system from the backscattered external noise. Also, it is promising to explore more functions and applications using a cavity magnonic system with real gain. ",

It is shown that the negative losses in some resonators can switch the system into a lasing regime with Wannier-Stark states serving as working modes. It is shown by extensive numerical simulations that there may be single-frequency stationary regimes as well as multi-frequency regimes. In the latter case Bloch oscillations can appear in the system. The possibility of selective excitation of Wannier-Stark states by the appropriate choice of the dissipation profile is investigated. A simple perturbation theory describing the quasi-linear regimes is developed and compared against the numerical results. ",

    "abstract": "Engineering the local density of states with nanophotonic structures is a powerful tool to control light-matter interactions via the Purcell effect. At optical frequencies, control over the electric field density of states is typically used to couple to and manipulate electric dipole transitions. However, it is also possible to engineer the magnetic density of states to control magnetic dipole transitions. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the optical magnetic Purcell effect using a single rare earth ion coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. We engineer a new single photon emitter, Er$^{3+}$ in MgO, where the electric dipole decay rate is strongly suppressed by the cubic site symmetry, giving rise to a nearly pure magnetic dipole optical transition. This allows the unambiguous determination of a magnetic Purcell factor $P_m=1040 \\pm 30$. We further extend this technique to realize a magnetic dipole spin-photon interface, performing optical spin initialization and readout of a single Er$^{3+}$ electron spin. This work demonstrates the fundamental equivalence of electric and magnetic density of states engineering, and provides a new tool for controlling light-matter interactions for a broader class of emitters.

Bell -- in the case of free field theory, regularized on a lattice. We then argue that this picture looks qualitatively similar when generalized to interacting scalar field theory. Lastly, we compare the Nelsonian framework to various other proposed ontologies for QFT, and remark upon their relative merits in light of the effective field theory paradigm. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a methodology for improving the accuracy of surrogate models of the observable response of physical systems as a function of the systems' spatially heterogeneous parameter fields with applications to uncertainty quantification and parameter estimation in high-dimensional problems. Practitioners often formulate finite-dimensional representations of spatially heterogeneous parameter fields using truncated unconditional Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansions (KLEs) for a certain choice of unconditional covariance kernel and construct surrogate models of the observable response with respect to the random variables in the KLE. When direct measurements of the parameter fields are available, we propose improving the accuracy of these surrogate models by representing the parameter fields via conditional Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansions (CKLEs). CKLEs are constructed by conditioning the covariance kernel of the unconditional expansion on the direct measurements via Gaussian process regression and then truncating the corresponding KLE. We apply the proposed methodology to constructing surrogate models via the Basis Adaptation (BA) method of the stationary hydraulic head response, measured at spatially discrete observation locations, of a groundwater flow model of the Hanford Site, as a function of the 1,000-dimensional representation of the model's log-transmissivity field. We find that BA surrogate models of the hydraulic head based on CKLEs are more accurate than BA surrogate models based on unconditional expansions for forward uncertainty quantification tasks. Furthermore, we find that inverse estimates of the hydraulic transmissivity field computed using CKLE-based BA surrogate models are more accurate than those computed using unconditional BA surrogate models.

Another goal of the work is to carry out cross calibration of the radiometers onboard spacecraft using the calibrated data of the ground-based radio telescopes. One of the most common methods of remote diagnostics of the solar corona is the study of radio emission, the sources of which are located in the solar corona at different heliocentric altitudes. The technique of joint space terrestrial observations consists in the simultaneous observation of individual events and their analysis in the widest possible frequency band during the maximum approach of the PSP vehicle to the Sun. At the same time, observation in the common frequency band is proposed to be used for calibration of the onboard radio receivers. The methods of planning joint space terrestrial observations are substantiated. Using the data of the UTR 2, URAN 2 radio telescopes and the PSP probe, the dynamic and polarization spectra of the simultaneously observed bursts on June 9, 2020 were obtained. The identification and comparison of individual bursts was carried out. A common dynamic spectrum of the bursts in the frequency band 0.5 ... 32 MHz was obtained. Cross calibration of the HFR receiver of the FIELDS PSP module in the frequency band 10...18 MHz was made using the calibrated data of terrestrial radio telescopes. The effectiveness of ground-based support of the PSP mission by the large Ukrainian radio telescopes is shown. Examples of joint observations are given, and the method of cross calibration of the FIELD PSP module receivers is demonstrated.
