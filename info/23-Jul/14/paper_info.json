Novel, non-destructive and in situ techniques to probe electrochemical interfaces during lithium electrodeposition are highly desirable. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of transient grating spectroscopy to monitor lithium electrodeposition at the micrometer scale by generating and detecting surface acoustic waves that sensitively interact with the deposited lithium. Specifically, we show that the evolution of the frequency, velocity and damping rate of the surface acoustic waves strongly correlate with the lithium nucleation and growth process. Our work illustrates the sensitivity of high-frequency surface acoustic waves to micrometer scale changes in electrochemical cells and establishes transient grating spectroscopy as a versatile platform for future in situ investigation of electrochemical inte ",

This paper presents a sensor array with three metal oxide electrodes that can use machine learning methods to identify four distinct VOCs in a mixture.

The dataset obtained from individual gases and their mixtures were analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. KNN and RF have shown more than 99% accuracy in classifying different varying chemicals in the gas mixtures. In regression analysis, KNN has delivered the best results with R2 value of more than 0.99 and LOD of 0.012, 0.015, 0.014 and 0.025 PPM for predicting the concentrations of varying chemicals Acetone, Toluene, Ethanol, and Chloroform, respectively in complex mixtures.

Here, we demonstrated a compact metasurface array-based spectroscopic ellipsometry system that allows single-shot spectropolarimetric detection and accurate determination of thin film properties without any mechanical movement. The silicon-based metasurface array with a highly anisotropic and diverse spectral response is combined with iterative optimization to reconstruct the full Stokes polarization spectrum of the light reflected by the thin film with high fidelity. Subsequently, the film thickness and refractive index can be determined by fitting the measurement results to a proper material model with high accuracy. Our approach opens up a new pathway towards a compact and robust spectroscopic ellipsometry system for the high throughput measurement of thin film properties. ",

Employing a non-destructive diagnostic method based on scattered light imaging, we identify the sources and waveguide sections that contribute to the imperfections in the QPM spectrum. Furthermore, by mapping the TFLN film thickness across the entire waveguiding regions, we successfully reproduce the QPM spectra numerically, thus confirming the prominent influence of film thickness variations on the observed spectral imperfections. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the identification and mitigation of spectral imperfections in TFLN-based frequency doublers, paving the way toward the realization of nonlinear optical devices with enhanced efficiency and improved spectral fidelity.

This is a challenge for the planned use of WFMs in the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), where they will be used to measure the center offset between the accelerating structures and the beam.

We find that cross-correlation power spectra offer a calibration-free distinctive signature of the presence of a directional force, and its orientation quadrant, unlike normal power spectral densities (PSDs).

In an ONN, the activation function (AF) is a crucial component determining the network performances and on-chip AF devices are still in development. Here, we first demonstrate on-chip reconfigurable AF devices with phase activation fulfilled by dual-functional graphene/silicon (Gra/Si) heterojunctions. With optical modulation and detection in one device, time delays are shorter, energy consumption is lower, reconfigurability is higher and the device footprint is smaller than other on-chip AF strategies. The experimental modulation voltage (power) of our Gra/Si heterojunction achieves as low as 1 V (0.5 mW), superior to many pure silicon counterparts. In the photodetection aspect, a high responsivity of over 200 mA/W is realized. Special nonlinear functions generated are fed into a complex-valued ONN to challenge handwritten letters and image recognition tasks, showing improved accuracy and potential of high-efficient, all-component-integration on-chip ONN. Our results offer new insights for on-chip ONN devices and pave the way to high-performance integrated optoelectronic computing circuits. ",

The electro-magnetic design of the cavity was inherited from the LHC Accelerator Research Program (LARP) but needed to be revised to meet new project requirements and to prevent issues encountered during beam tests performed at CERN in the R&D phase. Two prototype cavities were manufactured in industry and cold tested. Challenges specific to the RFD cavity were the stringent interface tolerances, the pole symmetry, and the higher-order-mode impedance spectrum.

    "abstract": "Falling raindrops are usually considered purely negative factors for traditional optical imaging because they generate not only rain streaks but also rain fog, resulting in a decrease in the visual quality of images. However, this work demonstrates that the image degradation caused by falling raindrops can be eliminated by the raindrops themselves. The temporal second-order correlation properties of the photon number fluctuation introduced by falling raindrops has a remarkable attribute: the rain streak photons and rain fog photons result in the absence of a stable second-order photon number correlation, while this stable correlation exists for photons that do not interact with raindrops. This fundamental difference indicates that the noise caused by falling raindrops can be eliminated by measuring the second-order photon number fluctuation correlation in the time domain. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the rain removal effect of this method is even better than that of deep learning methods when the integration time of each measurement event is short. This high-efficient quantum rain removal method can be used independently or integrated into deep learning algorithms to provide front-end processing and high-quality materials for deep learning. ",

Among the various sources of dephasing, acoustic phonons play a central role in adding decoherence to the single photon emission. Here, we demonstrate, that it is possible to tune and engineer the coherence of photons emitted from a single WSe$_2$ monolayer quantum dot via selectively coupling it to a spectral cavity resonance. We utilize an open cavity to demonstrate spectral enhancement, leveling and suppression of the highly asymmetric phonon sideband, finding excellent agreement with our microscopic theory. Most importantly, the impact of cavity tuning on the dephasing is directly assessed via optical interferometry, which clearly points out the capability to utilize light-matter coupling to steer and design dephasing and coherence of the emission properties of atomically thin crystals.
