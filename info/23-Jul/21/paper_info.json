    "abstract": "Many experiments in atomic and molecular physics require simultaneous frequency stabilization of multiple lasers. We present a stabilization scheme based on a scanning transfer cavity lock that is simple, stable and easily scalable to many lasers at minimal cost. The scheme is based on the Red Pitaya STEMlab platform, with custom software developed and implemented to achieve up to 100 Hz bandwidth. As an example demonstration, we realize simultaneous stabilization of up to four lasers and a reduction of long-term drifts to well below 1 MHz per hour. This meets typical requirements, e.g. for experiments on laser cooling of molecules. ",

    "abstract": "The development of novel strategies for self-assembly in the field of nanotechnology has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years. Here, we present a DNA-driven programmable self-assembly to fabricate the targeted nanophotonic structures. The exploitation of the programmable properties of DNA and the unique optical properties of QDs unfolds the ability to engineer complex nanostructures with laser irradiation. The main advantages of this method are the precise interaction of colloidal quantum dots (QDs)/nanoparticles (NPs) with the substrate and its reversibility in tuning the temperature of the medium. Two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical patterns of QD-ssDNA (ss-single stranded) conjugates were formed over the amine-ssDNA (NH-ssDNA complementary to the ssDNA conjugated with QDs) coated glass substrates using the laser (green laser light) radiation for3 or4 h. The localised heating effect of laser created a dark spot on the substrate where the laser was irradiated. The optical microscopy images confirmed the effect of laser irradiation on the coating behaviour of QD-ssDNA conjugates on the substrate. Further, green-emitting QD-ssDNA were coated onto the hole created by laser radiation over the red-emitting QD-ssDNA-coated substrate. The optical properties of DNA-functionalized QDs can be actively controlled on the complementary DNA-functionalized glass surface by an external optical excitation. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of light-driven self-assembly as a powerful tool for fabricating desired nanostructures of DNA-QD conjugates. This technique holds promise for various applications, including the development of advanced optical devices, nanophotonic circuits, and bioengineering systems. ",

Diamond surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are capable of high efficiency in phonon interaction with color centers in diamond. The temperature dependence of the quality factor is crucial for inferring the governing mechanism of coupling efficiency between phonons and color centers in diamond. In this paper, we report on the temperature dependence of the quality factor of an AlN/diamond SAW device from room temperature to 5 K. The temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency suggests that the mechanism of SAW dissipation in the AlN/diamond SAW resonator at 5 GHz is the phonon-phonon scattering in the Akheiser region, and that further cooling can be expected to improve the quality factor. This result provides a crucial guideline for the future design of AlN/diamond SAW devices. ",

These optically trapped oscillators provide compact particle confinement and strong oscillator stiffness. But these features are limited by the size of the focused light spot of a laser beam, which is typically restricted by the optical diffraction limit. Here, we propose to build an optical potential well with fine features assisted by the nonlinearity of the particle material, which is independent of the optical diffraction limit. We show that the potential well shape can have super-oscillation-like features and a Fano-resonance-like phenomenon, and the width of the optical trap is far below the diffraction limit. A particle with nonlinearity trapped by an ordinary optical beam provides a new platform with a sub-diffraction potential well and can have applications in high-accuracy optical manipulation and high-precision metrology.

The tuner is equipped with three encapsulated piezos that deliver long and short-range frequency tuning. Modifications were implemented on the first tuner design due to the low forces on the piezos caused by the cavity. Three brass rods with Belleville washers were added to the design to increase the overall force on the piezos. The testing results at 2 K are presented with the original design tuner and with the modification. ",

EM metasurfaces have previously been used to manipulate EM waves by adjusting the local phase of subwavelength elements within the wavelength scale, resulting in a variety of intriguing devices. However, the majority of these devices have only been capable of performing a single function, making it difficult to achieve multiple functionalities in a single design. Graphene, as an active material, offers unique properties, such as tunability, making it an excellent candidate for achieving tunable metasurfaces. The proposed procedure involves using two CNNs to design the passive structure of the graphene metasurfaces and predict the chemical potentials required for tunable responses. The CNNs are trained using transfer learning, which significantly reduced the time required to collect the training dataset. The proposed inverse design methodology demonstrates excellent performance in designing reconfigurable EM metasurfaces, which can be tuned to produce multiple functions, making it highly valuable for various applications. The results indicate that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate and provides a promising method for designing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for future wireless communication systems.

We provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of basic microcavity parameters on computational metrics of the system, namely, the dimensionality and the consistency. Importantly, we find that differences between frequencies and bandwidths of supermodes formed by the direct coupling is the determining factor of the reservoir's dimensionality and its scalability. The network's dimensionality can be improved with frequency-shifting nonlinear effects such as the Kerr effect, while two-photon absorption has an opposite effect.

    "abstract": "In a noisy environment with weak single levels, quantum illumination can outperform classical illumination in determining the presence and range of a target object even in the limit of sub-optimal measurements based on non-simultaneous, phase-insensitive coincidence counts. Motivated by realistic experimental protocols, we present a theoretical framework for analysing coincident multi-shot data with simple detectors. This approach allows for the often-overlooked non-coincidence data to be included, as well as providing a calibration-free threshold for inferring the presence and range of an object, enabling a fair comparison between different detection regimes. Our results quantify the advantage of quantum over classical illumination when performing target discrimination in a noisy thermal environment, including estimating the number of shots required to detect a target with a given confidence level.

    "title": "Global Precipitation Nowcasting of Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals  for GPM: A U-Net Convolutional LSTM Architecture",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep learning architecture for nowcasting of precipitation almost globally every 30 min with a 4-hour lead time. The architecture fuses a U-Net and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and is trained using data from the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and a few key precipitation drivers from the Global Forecast System (GFS). The impacts of different training loss functions, including the mean-squared error (regression) and the focal-loss (classification), on the quality of precipitation nowcasts are studied. The results indicate that the regression network performs well in capturing light precipitation (below 1.6 mm/hr), but the classification network can outperform the regression network for nowcasting of precipitation extremes (>8 mm/hr), in terms of the critical success index (CSI).. Using the Wasserstein distance, it is shown that the predicted precipitation by the classification network has a closer class probability distribution to the IMERG than the regression network. It is uncovered that the inclusion of the physical variables can improve precipitation nowcasting, especially at longer lead times in both networks. Taking IMERG as a relative reference, a multi-scale analysis in terms of fractions skill score (FSS), shows that the nowcasting machine remains skillful (FSS > 0.5) at the resolution of 10 km compared to 50 km for GFS. For precipitation rates greater than 4~mm/hr, only the classification network remains FSS-skillful on scales greater than 50 km within a 2-hour lead time. ",
