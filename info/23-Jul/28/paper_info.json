    "title": "High Speed Precise Refractive Index Modification for Photonic Chips  through Phase Aberrated Pulsed Lasers",
    "abstract": "Integrated photonic chips have significant potential in telecommunications, classic computing, quantum systems, and topological photonics. Direct laser writing offers unique capability for creating three-dimensional photonic devices in an optical glass chip with quick prototyping. However, existing laser writing schemes cannot create index-modified structures in glass that precisely match the laser focal shape while also achieving high scanning speed and high refractive index contrast. Here, we introduce the theory of a refractive index modification scheme that combines the advantages of both traditional non-thermal and thermal regime fabrication methods. We also propose a model of waveguide formation that was verified through a thorough study on the effects of phase aberrations on the laser focus. The presented new photonic chip fabrication scheme uses a novel focal intensity distribution, where pulse energy is relocated to the bottom of a laser focus by manipulating primary and higher order spherical aberrations. The technique can produce index modifications with high scanning speed (20 mm/s or higher), high index contrast (16 x 10-3), and high precision to fabricate with arbitrary cross-sections. This method has potential to expand the capabilities of photonic chips in applications that require small-scale, high precision, or high contrast refractive index control. ",

    "abstract": "We examine energy level-crossings of fine-structure (FS) levels in the heavier highly charged ions (HCIs) with $d^6$ and $d^8$ configurations. From the analysis, we find that some of these HCIs are tailor-made for atomic clocks with quality factors ranging from $10^{16}$ to $10^{18}$ and fractional uncertainties below $10^{-19}$ level. Many of them are also realized to be highly sensitive to the observation of temporal variation of FS constant ($\\alpha$) and testing violation of local Lorentz symmetry invariance (LLI). To probe variations of $\\alpha$ and LLI, we have determined their corresponding sensitivity coefficients in the investigated HCIs. Similarly, we have estimated orders of magnitudes of the Zeeman, Stark, black-body radiation and electric quadrupole shifts of the clock transitions of the considered HCIs in order to demonstrate them as the potential candidates for atomic clocks.

    "title": "Non-invasive Deep-Brain Imaging with 3D Integrated Photoacoustic  Tomography and Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (3D-PAULM)",
    "abstract": "Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a proven technology for imaging hemodynamics in deep brain of small animal models. PACT is inherently compatible with ultrasound (US) imaging, providing complementary contrast mechanisms. While PACT can quantify the brain's oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (sO$_2$), US imaging can probe the blood flow based on the Doppler effect. Further, by tracking gas-filled microbubbles, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can map the blood flow velocity with sub-diffraction spatial resolution. In this work, we present a 3D deep-brain imaging system that seamlessly integrates PACT and ULM into a single device, 3D-PAULM. Using a low ultrasound frequency of 4 MHz, 3D-PAULM is capable of imaging the whole-brain hemodynamic functions with intact scalp and skull in a totally non-invasive manner. Using 3D-PAULM, we studied the mouse brain functions with ischemic stroke. Multi-spectral PACT, US B-mode imaging, microbubble-enhanced power Doppler (PD), and ULM were performed on the same mouse brain with intrinsic image co-registration. From the multi-modality measurements, we future quantified blood perfusion, sO$_2$, vessel density, and flow velocity of the mouse brain, showing stroke-induced ischemia, hypoxia, and reduced blood flow. We expect that 3D-PAULM can find broad applications in studying deep brain functions on small animal models. ",

    "abstract": "Ultrahigh quality factor (Q) microcavities have been emerging as an appealing compact photonic platform for various applications. The Q factor plays a critical role in determining the nonlinear optical performance of a microcavity. However, a silica microcavity suffers from severe degradation of its Q value over time during storage or use in air due to the accumulating surface absorption loss, which would deteriorate their nonlinear photonic performance. Here, we report a new type of ultrahigh Q silica microcavity that effectively prevents the Q degradation over time. The Q values of the devices remain unchanged over time under storage in air. Optical frequency combs are generated with sustainable ultralow threshold performance in the course of time from the devices in open air. This approach would greatly facilitate ultrahigh Q silica-based photonic devices for next generation photonic applications. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs) are essential for non-volatile magneto-resistive random access memory (MRAM) applications. Here, we report the observation of a large negative tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB system with an orthogonally-magnetized configuration. Through the thickness modulation of the MgO barrier, the negative TMR component can be enhanced up to 20% under a negative voltage bias. Moreover, the tunnel anisotropic magneto-resistance measurements unveil that the negative TMR component likely arises from the interfacial resonance states (IRS) in the minority band of the bottom ferromagnetic layer. Complementary first principle calculations further quantify the IRS location and strength with respect to the Fermi level position. Our work not only confirm the vital role of IRS in the electrical transport of MTJ, but also provide valuable insights for the design of new-generation voltage-controlled MRAM and related spintronic applications.

    "abstract": "Molecular polaritons arise when molecules interact so strongly with light that they become entangled with each other. This light-matter hybridization alters the chemical and physical properties of the molecular system and allows chemical reactions to be controlled without the use of external fields. We investigate the impact of strong light-matter coupling on the electronic structure using perturbative approaches and demonstrate that Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory can reproduce the ground state energies in optical cavities to comparable accuracy as ab initio cavity quantum electrodynamics methodologies for currently relevant coupling strengths. The method is effective in both low and high cavity frequency regimes and straightforward to implement via response functions. Furthermore, we establish simple relations between cavity-induced intermolecular forces and van der Waals forces. These findings provide valuable insight into the manipulation of ground-state polaritonic energy landscapes, shedding light on the systems and conditions in which modifications can be achieved. ",

We show that the conjugacy class transitions in the eigenenergy braid results in the changes in the number of bands in a complete point-gap loop. This transition occurs at exceptional points. We numerically demonstrate these concepts using two-dimensional reciprocal and nonreciprocal photonic crystals. ",

With the rapidly programmable illumination patterns, we have firstly demonstrated how to mitigate phototoxicity when imaging nanodiamonds in cell samples. As a showcase, we have performed the super-resolved quantum sensing measurements of two individual nanodiamonds not even distinguishable with conventional WQDM. The DMD-powered WQDM presents not only excellent compatibility with quantum sensing solutions, but also strong advantages in high imaging speed, high resolution, low phototoxicity, and enhanced signal-to-background ratio, making it a competent tool to for applications in demanding fields such as biomedical science.

Remarkably, our algorithm offers a practical and accessible experimental realization, bypassing the need for high-order operations and overcoming experimental constraints.
