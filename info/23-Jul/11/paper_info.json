    "abstract": "Despite its fundamental importance and widespread use for assessing reaction success in organic chemistry, deducing chemical structures from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements has remained largely manual and time consuming. To keep up with the accelerated pace of automated synthesis in self driving laboratory settings, robust computational algorithms are needed to rapidly perform structure elucidations. We analyse the effectiveness of solving the NMR spectra matching task encountered in this inverse structure elucidation problem by systematically constraining the chemical search space, and correspondingly reducing the ambiguity of the matching task. Numerical evidence collected for the twenty most common stoichiometries in the QM9-NMR data base indicate systematic trends of more permissible machine learning prediction errors in constrained search spaces. Results suggest that compounds with multiple heteroatoms are harder to characterize than others. Extending QM9 by $\\sim$10 times more constitutional isomers with 3D structures generated by Surge, ETKDG and CREST, we used ML models of chemical shifts trained on the QM9-NMR data to test the spectra matching algorithms. Combining both $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$ shifts in the matching process suggests twice as permissible machine learning prediction errors than for matching based on $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ shifts alone. Performance curves demonstrate that reducing ambiguity and search space can decrease machine learning training data needs by orders of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "Resonant modes determine the response of electromagnetic devices, including dielectric and plasmonic resonators. Relying on the degrees of freedom that metamaterials provide, this contribution shows how to design, at will, the resonant modes of a dielectric object placed in an unbounded space. Specifically, the proposed method returns in analytical form the spatial distribution of the dielectric susceptibility tensor for which the object exhibits resonances at prescribed frequencies and spatial distribution of the polarization. Together with the synthesis of the material, two key concepts are introduced: the controlled tunability of the resonant modes and the number of essential modes, i.e. the number of modes that uniquely characterize the spatial distribution of the dielectric susceptibility. Moreover, this approach can be applied to design the resonant modes of any system where the constitutive relationship is linear and local. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: The mechanical properties of corneal tissues play a crucial role in determining corneal shape and have significant implications in vision care. This study aimed to address the challenge of obtaining accurate in vivo data for the human cornea. Methods: We have developed a high-frequency optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique using shear-like antisymmetric (A0)-mode Lamb waves at frequencies above 10 kHz. Results: By incorporating an anisotropic, nonlinear constitutive model and utilizing the acoustoelastic theory, we gained quantitative insights into the influence of corneal tension on wave speeds and elastic moduli. Our study revealed significant spatial variations in the shear modulus of the corneal stroma on healthy subjects for the first time. The central cornea exhibited a shear modulus of 74 kPa, while the corneal periphery showed a decrease to 41 kPa. The limbus demonstrated an increased shear modulus exceeding 100 kPa. We obtained wave displacement profiles that are consistent with highly anisotropic corneal tissues. Conclusion: Our approach enabled precise measurement of corneal tissue elastic moduli in situ with high precision (< 7%) and high spatial resolution (< 1 mm). Significance: The high-frequency OCE technique holds promise for biomechanical evaluation in clinical settings, providing valuable information for refractive surgeries, degenerative disorder diagnoses, and intraocular pressure assessments.

    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs have revolutionized precision measurement, time-keeping, and molecular spectroscopy. A substantial effort has developed around \"microcombs\": integrating comb-generating technologies into compact, reliable photonic platforms. Current approaches for generating these microcombs involve either the electro-optic (EO) or Kerr mechanisms. Despite rapid progress, maintaining high efficiency and wide bandwidth remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new class of microcomb -- an integrated optical frequency comb generator that combines electro-optics and parametric amplification to yield a frequency-modulated optical parametric oscillator (FM-OPO). In stark contrast to EO and Kerr combs, the FM-OPO microcomb does not form pulses but maintains operational simplicity and highly efficient pump power utilization with an output resembling a frequency-modulated laser. We outline the working principles of FM-OPO and demonstrate them by fabricating the complete optical system in thin-film lithium niobate (LNOI). We measure pump to comb internal conversion efficiency exceeding 93% (34% out-coupled) over a nearly flat-top spectral distribution spanning approximately 1,000 modes (approximately 6 THz). Compared to an EO comb, the cavity dispersion rather than loss determines the FM-OPO bandwidth, enabling broadband combs with a smaller RF modulation power. The FM-OPO microcomb, with its robust operational dynamics, high efficiency, and large bandwidth, contributes a new approach to the field of microcombs and promises to herald an era of miniaturized precision measurement, and spectroscopy tools to accelerate advancements in metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, sensing, and computing.

    "abstract": "Treatment planning systems at proton-therapy centres generally use X-ray computed tomography (CT) as primary imaging technique to infer the proton treatment doses to tumour and healthy tissues. However, proton stopping powers in the body, as derived from X-ray images, suffer from important proton-range uncertainties. In order to reduce this uncertainty in range, one could use proton-CT images instead. The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of a newly-developed proton-CT scanner, based on the use of a set of tracking detectors and a high energy resolution scintillator for the residual energy of the protons. Different custom-made phantoms were positioned at the field of view of the scanner and were irradiated with protons at the CCB proton-therapy center in Krakow. We measured with the phantoms at different angles and produced sinograms that were used to obtain reconstructed images by Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). The obtained images were used to determine the capabilities of our scanner in terms of spatial resolution and proton Relative Stopping Power mapping and validate its use as proton-CT scanner. The results show that the scanner can produce medium-high quality images, with spatial resolution better than 2 mm in radiography, below 3 mm in tomography and resolving power in the RSP comparable to other state of the art pCT cameras.

We observe that hot electrons are emitted in a collimated beam along the specular direction of the grating target. From the measured electron energy spectra we see electron temperature for grating is higher than the mirror, suggesting a higher electron yield and hence a stronger coupling with the laser. We performed numerical simulations which are in good agreement with experimental results, offer insights into the acceleration mechanism by resulting electric and magnetic fields. Such collimated fast electron beams have a wide range of applications in applied and fundamental science. ",

The conditions for RSAE spontaneous decay are investigated, and the saturation level and the consequent fuel ion heating rate are also derived.

Nonetheless, the development of graphene based sensors has been limited due to difficulties in fabrication, encapsulation, and packaging. Here we report a graphene nanoresonator based resonant pressure sensor. The graphene nano resonator is fabricated on a thin silicon diaphragm that deforms due to pressure differential across it. The deformation-induced strain change results in a resonance frequency shift of the graphene nano resonator. The pressure sensing experiments demonstrate a record high responsivity of 20Hz/Pa with a resolution of 90Pa. The resolution of the sensing scheme is 0.003% of the full-scale range of the pressure sensor. This exceptional performance is attributed to two factors: maintaining a high-quality vacuum environment for the nanoresonator and introducing stimuli through a thin silicon diaphragm. The proposed pressure sensor design provides flexibility to adjust responsivity and range as needed. The fabrication method is simple and has the potential to be integrated with standard CMOS fabrication. The innovative substrate packaging allows the coupling of the resonator's strain with pressure.

This is inverse cascading and occurs for an initial Batchelor spectrum, where the magnetic energy per linear wavenumber interval increases like $k^4$. For an initial Saffman spectrum that is proportional to $k^2$, however, inverse cascading is known not to occur. We study here the case of an intermediate $k^3$ spectrum, which may be relevant for magnetogenesis in the early Universe during the electroweak epoch. This case is not well understood in view of the standard Taylor expansion of the magnetic energy spectrum for small $k$. Using high resolution MHD simulations, we show that also in this case there is inverse cascading with a strength just as expected from the conservation of the Hosking integral, which governs the decay of an initial Batchelor spectrum.

However, if these systems are initially correlated, the energy flow can reverse, making the cold system colder and the hot system hotter. This intriguing phenomenon is called ``anomalous energy flow'' and shows the importance of initial correlations in determining physical properties of thermodynamic systems. Here we investigate the fundamental limits of this effect. Specifically, we find the optimal amount of energy that can be transferred between quantum systems under closed and reversible dynamics, which then allows us to characterize the anomalous energy flow. We then explore a more general scenario where the energy flow is mediated by an ancillary quantum system that acts as a catalyst. We show that this approach allows for exploiting previously inaccessible types of correlations, ultimately resulting in an energy transfer that surpasses our fundamental bound. To demonstrate these findings, we use a well-studied quantum optics setup involving two atoms coupled to an optical cavity. ",

In this study, we investigate the optical power dependence of the ODMR spectra using NV ensemble in nanodiamonds (NDs) and a single-crystal bulk diamond. We find that the splitting width exponentially decays and is saturated as the optical power increases. Comparison between NDs and a bulk sample shows that while the decay amplitude is sample-dependent, the optical power at which the decay saturates is almost sample-independent. We propose that this unexpected phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the NV center due to non-axisymmetry deformation or impurities.
