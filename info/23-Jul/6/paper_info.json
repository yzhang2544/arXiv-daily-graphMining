    "abstract": "Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical effect widely used for nonlinear optical microscopy and laser frequency conversion. Closed-form analytical solution of the nonlinear optical responses is essential for evaluating the optical responses of new materials whose optical properties are unknown a priori. A recent open-source code, #SHAARP.si, can provide such closed form solutions for crystals with arbitrary symmetries, orientations, and anisotropic properties at a single interface. However, optical components are often in the form of slabs, thin films on substrates, and multilayer heterostructures with multiple reflections of both the fundamental and up to ten different SHG waves at each interface, adding significant complexity. Many approximations have therefore been employed in the existing analytical approaches, such as slowly varying approximation, weak reflection of the nonlinear polarization, transparent medium, high crystallographic symmetry, Kleinman symmetry, easy crystal orientation along a high-symmetry direction, phase matching conditions and negligible interference among nonlinear waves, which may lead to large errors in the reported material properties. To avoid these approximations, we have developed an open-source package named Second Harmonic Analysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry in Multilayers (#SHAARP.ml). The reliability and accuracy are established by experimentally benchmarking with both the SHG polarimetry and Maker fringes predicted from the package using standard materials. ",

    "abstract": "Bound states in the continuum (BICs) theoretically have the ability to confine electromagnetic waves in limited regions with infinite radiative quality ($Q$) factors. However, in practical experiments, resonances can only exhibit finite $Q$ factors due to unwanted scattering losses caused by fabrication imperfections. Recently, it has been shown that ultrahigh-$Q$ guided-mode resonances (GMRs), which are robust to fabrication imperfections, can be realized by merging multiple BICs in momentum space. In this study, we analytically and numerically investigate the merging and band transition of accidental BICs in planar photonic lattices. Accidental BICs can merge at the edges of the second stop band, either with or without a symmetry-protected BIC. We show that as the thickness of the photonic lattice gradually increases, the merged state of BICs transitions from the upper to the lower band edge. Using coupled-mode analysis, we present the analytical merging thickness at which multiple accidental BICs merge at the second-order $\\Gamma$ point. Our coupled-mode analysis could be beneficial for achieving ultrahigh-$Q$ GMRs in various photonic lattices composed of materials with different dielectric constants. ",

    "abstract": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will undergo an upgrade in order to increase its luminosity to $7.5 \\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The increased luminosity during this High-Luminosity running phase (HL-LHC), starting around 2029, means a higher rate of proton-proton interactions, hence a larger ionizing dose and particle fluence for the detectors. The current tracking system of the CMS experiment will be fully replaced in order to cope with the new operating conditions. Prototype planar pixel sensors for the CMS Inner Tracker with square $50 \\mu $m $ \\times \\; 50 \\mu$m and rectangular $100 \\mu $m $ \\times \\; 25 \\mu$m pixels read out by the RD53A chip were characterized in the lab and at the DESY-II testbeam facility in order to identify designs that meet the requirements of CMS at the HL-LHC. A spatial resolution of approximately 3.4$\\mu$m (2$\\mu$m) is obtained using the modules with $50 \\mu $m $ \\times \\; 50 \\mu$m ($100 \\mu $m $ \\times \\; 25 \\mu$m) pixels at the optimal angle of incidence before irradiation.

While optically levitated, we studied the refrigeration of both types of nanoparticles while varying the pressure. We found that the core-shell design shows an improvement in the minimum final temperature: a fourth of the core-shell nanoparticles showed a significant cooling compared to almost none of the bare nanoparticles. Specifically, We measured a core-shell nanoparticle cooling down to a temperature of 147 K at 26 mbar in the underdamped regime. Our study is a first step towards engineering nanoparticles that are suitable for achieving absolute (centre-of-mass and internal temperature) cooling in levitation, opening new avenues for force sensing and the realization of macroscopic quantum superpositions.

    "abstract": "Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials represent a powerful toolkit for selectively transmitting and localizing light through cavity resonances, enabling the study of mesoscopic phenomena and facilitating the design of photonic devices. In this experimental study, we demonstrate the feasibility of engineering and actively controlling cavity modes, as well as tuning their mutual coupling, in an ENZ multilayer structure. Specifically, by employing a high-birefringence liquid crystal film as a tunable nanocavity, the polarization-dependent coupling of resonant modes with narrow spectral width and spatial extent was achieved. Surface forces aparatus (SFA) allowed us to continuously and precisely control the thickness of the liquid crystal film contained between the nanocavities and thus vary the detuning between the cavity modes. Hence, we were able to manipulate nanocavities anti-crossing behaviors. The suggested methodology unlocks the full potential of tunable optical coupling in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials and provides a versatile approach to the creation of tunable photonic devices, including bio-photonic sensors, and/or tunable planar metamaterials for on-chip spectrometers.

The protons from the microwave discharge ion source are transversely matched to the RFQ via an optimized Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) line which also contains an integrated measurement station, called measurement station (MBOX). The MBOX is used to measure the proton beam's current along with pulse length duration, profile as well as the beam emittance upstream of the RFQ. It contains a number of home-built diagnostic tools: a Faraday cup, a scintillator screen and a pepper pot plate (PP). The analysis software is also locally developed and tested for the PP photo analysis. In this note, the design, construction and tests of the integrated measurement station are discussed. The results from various measurements, especially on beam profile and charge, are compared to the simulation predictions. ",

The coupling is characterized using a coherent measurement technique developed for measuring weak couplings deep in the sideband unresolved regime. The technique is based on two-probe optomechanically induced transparency/amplification using amplitude modulation. Instead of measuring two probe tones separately, they are interfered to retain only a signal coherent with the mechanical motion.

Although there have been remarkable strides in achieving low-dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer-scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 10^8 at room temperature, the highest value achieved among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free-standing resonators. This robust thin-film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin-film materials in high-performance applications. ",

Therefore, entanglement-based protocols must be preferred since, along with overcoming the distance limitation, one can consider the satellite as an untrusted device too. E91 protocol is a good candidate for satellite-based quantum communication; but the key rate is low as most of the measured qubits are utilized to verify a Bell-CHSH inequality to ensure security against Eve. An entanglement-based protocol requires a maximally entangled state for more secure key distribution. The current work discusses the effect of non-maximality on secure key distribution. It establishes a lower bound on the non-maximality condition below which no secure key can be extracted.
