    "abstract": "           The China Space Station (CSS) is currently in orbit and carries the high-precision optical atomic clock with stability of approximately $2.0 \\times 10^{-15} / \\sqrt{\\tau}$ in its experiment module. We have developed a model to determine the gravity potential (GP) based on the gravity frequency shift equation and have created both one-way and dual-frequency transfer models up to $c^{-4}$. These models consider effects from the troposphere, ionosphere, and solid Earth tides. The proposed model is suitable for measurements at the magnitude of $10^{-19}$. Based on the CSS mission, we conducted the simulation experiments. The results indicate that when processing the simulation frequency signal using the proposed model, we can obtain the GP with the accuracies of $ (1.13\\pm0.71)\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $ (0.09\\pm0.89)\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, and $(0.66\\pm1.18)\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$ for cutoff elevation angles of $5^{\\circ}$, $10^{\\circ}$ and $15^{\\circ}$, respectively. With the high-precision optical atomic clock onboard the CSS, the proposed model enables us to measure the GP differences in the magnitude of centimeter-level accuracy.         ",

However, when the mesa size is reduced to around tens of micrometers or less, the luminous efficiency is constrained by the \"efficiency-on-size effect\". This work details the fabrication of gallium nitride (GaN) based Micro-LEDs with various mesa shapes and a single porous layer under the active region. A modified green LED epitaxial structure with different doped n-GaN layers combined with electrochemical etching created the porous layer. The strong light confinement achieved by the porous layer and the polygonal mesa greatly enhances spontaneous emission. The luminous intensity of the Micro-LEDs with the porous layer is approximately 22 times greater than those Micro-LEDs without the porous layer. A significant reduction in minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) was observed in polygonal devices, suggesting a change in the luminescence mechanism. The influence of varying device geometry on emission performance was investigated. Experimental results reveal that, unlike circular porous Micro-LEDs, square and hexagonal porous Micro-LEDs exhibit more pronounced resonant emission, which provides a new technological approach for the further development of high-performance Micro-LEDs and lasers.

First, we demonstrate high detector responsivity at 1550 nm illumination at 20 mK, a wavelength band unavailable to cryogenic standard InGaAs detectors due to the temperature-dependent bandgap shift. Second, we demonstrate an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the shot noise limit for cryogenic short optical pulse detection when compared to conventional modulated continuous-wave laser detection. At 40 uA of photocurrent and a detector temperature of 4 K, short pulse detection yields an SNR improvement of 20 dB and 3 dB for phase and amplitude quadratures, respectively. Lastly, we discuss how short pulse detection offers a path for signal multiplexing, with a demonstration of simultaneous production of microwave pulses at two different carrier frequencies. Together, these advancements establish a path towards low noise and power efficient multiplexed photonic links for quantum computing with a large number of superconducting qubits.         ",

Using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with machine learning, the study explores the electronic, optical, and catalytic properties of the material. The optimized PbS structure exhibited a direct bandgap of 1.191 eV, while co-doping with Yb and Er transitioned the material to a metallic state, enhancing charge carrier mobility and electron-hole separation. The final heterostructure displayed an indirect bandgap of 0.431 eV, favorable for visible-light absorption. Key findings include an internal electric field strength of 6.3 Debye, efficient charge transfer confirmed by Bader analysis, and strong optical absorption at 2.4 eV. Machine learning models, including DNN and LSTM, were employed to predict photon absorption rates, achieving mean squared errors as low as 0.0004. The synergistic effects of enhanced internal electric fields, optimized band structures, and strong photon absorption underscore the materials' potential for efficient hydrogen production.

    "abstract": "           Specialty optical fibres, usually the silica-based ones doped with rare-earth ions, have been heart of fibre amplifiers and lasers spread thanks to work of team of Sir David N. Payne started in 1980-ies of 20th century. Wavelength of their emission depends on used rare earth, on glass matrix in which the rare earths are incorporated, on fibre structure in macro, micro and nano scale, and fibre laser arrangement. Usually, fibre lasers are operated at single wavelength. A typical example is an erbium fibre laser (erbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1550 nm or ytterbium fibre laser (ytterbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1060 nm. When erbium and ytterbium ions together are randomly distributed in a silica glass matrix and pumped at absorption band of ytterbium, laser emission is typically obtained only at 1550 nm (emission of erbium) thanks to energy transfer from ytterbium to erbium ions, supported by modification of silica glass matrix with phosphorous pentoxide. However, when erbium and ytterbium ions are specifically structured in micro or nano scale in the fibre core it is possible to obtain dual-wavelength laser operation with controlled output parameters. Such dual-wavelength operation with controlled output at 1042 nm and simultaneously at 1550 nm was demonstrated with structured core Er3+ and Yb3+-doped fibre. The proposed approach makes fabrication of active fibres emitting with controlled characteristics at more wavelengths possible.         ",

Spectroscopic and polarimetric alterations of terahertz light caused by Mie scattering patterns has the potential to be a diagnostic marker. Aim: We present an analysis of Monte Carlo simulation of Mie scattering of polarized terahertz light from cancerous tumor budding, compare the simulation to experimental results obtained in phantom models, and present an analysis of a polarization-sensitive terahertz scan of an ex vivo porcine burn injury. Approach: Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we modeled the changes in diffuse intensity and degree of polarization of broadband off-specular terahertz light due to scattering particles in highly attenuating tissue. We extracted the Mueller matrix of the tissue using this model and analyzed the Lu-Chipman product decomposition matrices. We compared this model to experimental data from four phantoms consisting of polypropylene particles of varying sizes embedded in gelatin. Finally, we induced a full-thickness burn injury in ex vivo porcine skin samples and compared experimental data from burned and healthy regions of the tissue. Results: Simulation revealed contrast in the Stokes vectors and Mueller Matrix elements for varying scattering particle sizes. Experimental phantom results showed contrast between different sizes of scattering particles in degree of polarization and diffuse intensity in agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, we demonstrated a similar diffused imaging signal contrast between burned and healthy regions of ex vivo porcine skin.

    "abstract": "           We propose an approach to extracting equivalent circuit models for waveguide-fed, resonant metamaterial elements, such as the complementary, electric inductive-capacitive element (cELC). From the scattering parameters of a single waveguide-fed cELC, effective electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be determined that can be expressed in terms of equivalent lumped element circuit components. The circuit model provides considerable insight into the electromagnetic scattering properties of cELCs as a function of their geometric parameters and imparts intuition useful for element optimization. We find that planar, inherently resonant, waveguide-fed elements exhibit a set of common properties that place constraints on their coupling, maximum radiation, and other key scattering parameters. In addition, unlike simple slots and other non-resonant irises, resonant elements introduce an effective transformer to the equivalent circuit that accounts for the field enhancement occurring in such elements at resonance. We introduce a general and robust method to determine the effective circuit parameters by fitting to the extracted polarizability, extending the approach to resonant metamaterial elements integrated with physical lumped circuit components, such as packaged capacitors or varactors. We find excellent agreement between the analytical predictions and full-wave simulations, such that with one or two full-wave simulations the properties of the cELC can be determined for any externally added lumped elements. This approach can be leveraged to dramatically increase the efficiency of metasurface aperture design, especially when libraries of element responses are required.         ",

As many applications use an ensemble of bridges, consistency of performance is critical to the functionality of the systems. If part of the same manufacturing batch and scaled to the same frequency, the noise performance of the ferrite cores at 293 K has a weighted mean variance of <0.3%, with all the cores within a +/- 1% band. At 140 K the weighted mean variance is <0.6% and the 90% inclusion band is +/- 1.5%. Ten cores of SIFERRIT Material N41, from TDK Ferrites Accessories, were tested at room temperature, 293 K, and in a liquid nitrogen dewar at 140 K. Fitted to a parabolic function, to + 3dB on both frequency sides, the weighted mean of the noise minima at 293 K was 0.3027 aF/rtHz, with a variance of 0.0012 aF/rtHz spanning a frequency range of 85.0 +/- 2.7 kHz. Scaled to 100 kHz, the weighted mean and variance were 0.2788 aF/rtHz and 0.0008 aF/rtHz.

From these simple laws, we can easily obtain the propagation distances in the analytical form where the beams operate at the Dirac points, and therefore, the Zener tunneling takes place due to the interband transition. We can also easily calculate the distances where beams reach the turning points in their motion. These distances just depend on the strength of the linear potential and the initial wavenumber of input beams.

In general, the refresh rates of the \"up\" and \"down\" polarization bunches are different. We suggest an alternative policy. We point out that the total bunch refresh rate is almost independent of the asymptotic level of the radiative polarization.

Conventional WGMs are achiral under the time-reversal symmetry, and show high sensitivity to defects in optical devices. Here, we introduce topological physics into photonic cavities and demonstrate the realization of chiral WGMs enabled by photonic Chern insulators. Through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental measurements, we reveal the critical differences between chiral and achiral WGMs, highlighting the robustness of chiral WGMs even in the presence of defects within the cavities. Our research provides valuable insights into the design of robust WGM cavities and offers a novel platform for exploring light-matter interaction phenomena.         ",

Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted reflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses to achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive index and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is derived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is preserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs inside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D axisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially redistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a Luneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as imaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the background poses significant challenges.

In optical traps driven by high-energy pulses, material non-linearity can result in unusual opto-mechanical effects, such as displaced equilibrium points. However, existing theoretical models of non-linear optical force on small particles consider smooth material dependence on the incident field strength alone, and not the feedback between the particle permittivity and internal field strength, which is, in turn, a function of the permittivity. The hysteresis effects of optical bistability in pulsed optical traps therefore elude existing optical force models. Here, we investigate a bistable optical trap, set up by counter-propagating ultrashort pulses, in which the optical force exerted on a particle depends not only on the field at the particle's current location, but on the particle's historic trajectory in the trap. The developed formalism will be important for designing optical traps and nanoparticle manipulation in pulsed field for various applications, including potentially time crystal demonstrations.

These studies, however, based on RDE, are mostly focused on the motion parameters of rotating objects; other equally important attitude characteristics, e.g., the tilt angle of the axis of rotation, have rarely been considered. We observed an interesting phenomenon in the experiments: the rotational Doppler spectral distribution varies with the ellipticity of the elliptical optical vortex (EOV) and the tilt angle between the rotational axis and optical axis, which inspired us to wonder if it is possible to detect oblique rotational axis or compensate the rotational Doppler broadening effect induced by oblique incidence by utilizing the EOV. Here, we reveal the RDE quantitative relationship with tilt angle and ellipticity for the first time and report a novel approach for tilt angle measurement. By employing a series of EOV with periodically varying ellipticity to illuminate a rotating object and analyze the time-frequency spectral distribution of scattered light associated with ellipticity and tilt angle, the tilt angle can be acquired accurately based on the specific relationship between the tilt angle and ellipticity of the EOV. Furthermore, the spectrum broadening effect arising from oblique incidence in the actual scenario may be addressed through our scheme. The method may find applications in industrial manufacturing and target attitude measurement, and our results provide new insights for obtaining more information about objects.         ",

Both transverse and longitudinal arrays of filaments are considered. The angular distribution and power in the THz signal are significantly modified, which is consistent with other trends reported in the literature. The frequency content of the THz emission signal is also strongly modified under certain conditions. Whereas the emission from a single filament is broadband, the emission from a periodic transverse array consists of several discrete frequencies. For this latter case, the THz spectrum can be approximated as the product of two factors - the spectrum from a single filament and a complex frequency-dependent phase factor associated with the spatial distribution of the filaments. The complex phase factor accounts for interference effects, amplifying certain frequencies from the single filament spectrum while suppressing others. The location and width of the discrete frequencies present in the final spectrum depends on the number of filaments and their spacing. frequency content in the THz signal.         ",

    "abstract": "           Single-cycle, high-power, high-repetition-rate THz pulse sources are becoming the cornerstone of several scientific and industrial applications. A promising and versatile method for high-power THz generation is optical rectification in nonlinear crystals pumped by powerful near-infrared ultrafast laser systems. In this context, ytterbium-based laser sources are particularly advantageous in terms of power scalability and technology establishment. However, as the repetition rate increases toward hundreds of MHz, the conversion efficiency typically decreases, as most laser systems do not reach sufficiently high average power to correspondingly enhance the peak power to drive the nonlinear conversion process efficiently. An alternative approach to achieving sufficiently high average power at high repetition rate is based on passive enhancement cavities, which boost the pulse energy of standard watt-level ytterbium lasers by orders of magnitude. We present the first demonstration of optical rectification in a passive enhancement cavity at multi-kW levels, achieved by a 240-fold power enhancement. By irradiating a 50-$\\mu$m thin lithium niobate plate with 1.9-kW average power inside the enhancement cavity, we generate milliwatt-level THz pulses with 2-THz bandwidth and 93-MHz repetition rate, mostly limited by the driving pulse duration. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest driving average power used for OR. This methodology represents a promising new step towards high-repetition-rate and high average power single-cycle THz sources using widely available multi-watt level Yb lasers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.         ",

The results demonstrate a pronounced anisotropy in the nonlinear refractive index, which exhibits a four-fold rotational symmetry, with its amplitude reduced by the NV concentration. The reduction in non-linear susceptibility is linked to the negative contribution of NV centers, modeled as two-level systems upon a strong, laser field, red-detuned relative to their resonance frequency. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between NV centers and nonlinear optical properties of diamond, offering potential pathways for tunable nonlinear optics applications.

With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\\mu^-$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^-$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\\mu^+e^-$, $\\mu^+e^+\\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\\mu^+e^+\\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states.

In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point.

This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.

    "abstract": "           We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.         ",

    "title": "Field-free, Quasi-continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interface with Two-dimensional Ferromagnetic Trap",
    "abstract": "           A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.         ",

    "abstract": "           We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or \"fiber\" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.         ",

    "abstract": "           Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.         ",

    "abstract": "           Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.
