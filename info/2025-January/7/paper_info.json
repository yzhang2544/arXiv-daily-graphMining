    "abstract": "           We propose a novel method to control the frequency of semiconductor lasers. The new technique allows fabricating three-terminal lasers with fast frequency tuning and the possibility to implement intrinsically the linearization of laser frequency sweep. The electrical contact located between the lower undoped cladding and the waveguide together with the upper laser contact enable pumping for optical gain. A voltage applied between the same contact and the contact located under the lower cladding induces space charge limited current (SCLC) across the lower cladding. Electrons driven into this layer create the space charge. The charge affects the refractive index of the layer and correspondingly the laser frequency. The proposed technique is applicable to any semiconductor lasers. Critical requirements are that free carrier concentration in the lower cladding must be small enough not to affect the SCLC and the laser gain must be high enough to overcome losses introduced by interactivity contact. As an example, we present the calculated characteristics of the QCL operated at 10$\\mu$m wavelength. Our calculations show that the laser frequency shift can reach GHz range and the laser tuning speed will be limited by external electronics. Calculations demonstrate that within the range of the selected parameters, the device possesses intrinsically linear relation between the optical frequency and the tuning voltage.         ",

    "abstract": "           As a conventional means to analyze the system mechanism based on partial differential equations (PDE) or nonlinear dynamics, iterative algorithms are computationally intensive. In this framework, the details of oscillating dynamics of cavity solitons are beyond the reach of traditional mathematical analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that this long-standing challenge could be tackled down with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We propose the incorporating parameter-fed ports, which are capable of recognizing period-doubling bifurcations of respiratory solitons and quickly predicting nonlinear dynamics of solitons with arbitrary parameter combinations and arbitrary time series lengths. The model predictions capture oscillatory features with a small Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) = 0.01676 and an absolute error that barely grows with the length of the prediction time. Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) based parameter space boundaries for typical oscillatory patterns are plotted at about 120 times the speed relative to the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) and higher resolution.

    "abstract": "           Single-shot terahertz (THz) spectroscopy probes sub-picosecond, non-repetitive events by combining the advantages of laser absorption techniques with the phase-sensitive detection of interferometric methods. However, its usage as a quantitative tool is hindered by the chirp penalty of the spectral encoding scheme, where a narrow probe bandwidth distorts the THz signal, limiting the bandwidth and spectral resolution of THz measurements. In this work, we introduce Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS), a method that leverages a broadband supercontinuum probe to overcome these challenges. With SETS, we show an increase in usable THz bandwidth from 1.5 THz to 2.3 THz, reducing signal distortion by 50% and offering a scalable pathway to extend bandwidth further. Numerical models of spectral encoding highlight the flexibility of SETS, achieving high spectral resolution (< 4 GHz with a 250 ps supercontinuum pulse) while maintaining a usable bandwidth > 1 THz for amplitude and phase spectra. Experiments on argon plasma and water vapor, complemented by theoretical validation, generalization, and extrapolation, show the capability of SETS to measure electron density, collision frequency, and absorption spectra simultaneously with tailored measurement accuracy and resolution (as low as 5x10^15 m^-3 for electron density). By addressing a critical limitation in single-shot diagnostics, SETS enables high-resolution, non-intrusive, quantitative measurements for complex reactive flows and dynamic refractive media.

    "abstract": "           Liquefaction is a significant geological hazard in earthquake-prone locations like Padang City, Indonesia. The phenomenon happens when saturated soil loses strength owing to seismic shaking, resulting in substantial infrastructure damage. Accurate identification of sensitive locations is critical to catastrophe mitigation. This study aims to map water distribution using optical satellite data and estimate its importance as a crucial element in determining liquefaction vulnerability. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to assess water and vegetation indexes, taking advantage of its sensitivity to water content in varied land surfaces. We recommended using the NIR (near-infrared) and SWIR (short wave infrared) bands with 832.8 nm and 2202.4 nm, respectively, which are sensitive to soil water content. High-resolution satellite data were used to create NDWI maps, highlighting locations with high water saturation. These findings were combined with geological and seismic data to identify liquefaction-prone zones. The study found that locations with high water content, as measured by NDWI, are highly associated with greater liquefaction susceptibility. The findings highlight the importance of water distribution in determining soil behavior during seismic occurrences. This study highlights the value of NDWI as a low-cost and efficient tool for measuring liquefaction vulnerability at the regional level. The technique offers insights into Padang City's urban planning, catastrophe risk reduction, and community preparedness.         ",

    "abstract": "           We assess how quantum-mechanical effects associated with high-frequency chromophore vibrations influence excitation energy transfer in biological light-harvesting complexes. We begin with a mixed quantum-classical theory that combines a quantum description of the electronic motion with a classical description of the nuclear motion in a way that is consistent with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution. We then include nuclear quantum effects in this theory with a variational polaron transformation of the high frequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with fully quantum mechanical benchmark calculations and then applied to three prototypical biological light-harvesting complexes. We find that high-frequency vibrations delay the energy transfer in the quantum treatment, but accelerate it in the classical treatment. For the inter-ring transfer in the light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the transfer rate is a factor of 1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than the classical. The transfer timescale in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex is essentially the same in both cases, whereas the transfer in light-harvesting complex II of spinach is 1.7 times slower in the quantum treatment. In all cases, the quantum mechanical long-time equilibrium populations of the chromophores are well reproduced by the classical treatment, suggesting that nuclear quantum effects are generally unimportant for the directionality of energy transfer. Nuclear quantum effects do however reduce the transfer rate in systems with large excitonic energy gaps and strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency vibrational modes.         ",

Here, we predict a universal pseudospin localization phenomenon induced by a disordered vectorial potential and demonstrate it experimentally in an optical analogue of a classical disordered spin-glass magnetic phase. In our system, a transverse disorder in the second-order nonlinear coupling of a nonlinear photonic crystal causes the idler-signal light beam, representing the pseudospin current, to become localized in the transverse plane. This effect depends strongly on the nonlinear coupling strength, controlled by the optical pump power, revealing its inherently nonlinear and non-perturbative nature. Furthermore, this phenomenon is marked by decaying Rabi oscillations between the idler and signal fields, linked to the disorder properties, suggesting an accompanied longitudinal decoherence effect. Our findings offer deep insights into spin transport in disordered magnetic textures and open avenues for exploring complex magnetic phases and phase transitions using nonlinear optics.         ",

This framework combines quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality. Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay between consciousness, observation, and reality.

    "abstract": "           Co-production of geothermal energy and lithium is an emerging opportunity with the potential to enhance the economic potential of geothermal operations. The economic reward of extracting lithium from geothermal brine is determined by how the lithium concentration evolves during brine production. In the initial stage, production will target lithium contained in the brine resident close to the production well. While lithium recharge, in the form of rock dissolution and inflow from other parts of the reservoir, is possible, the efficiency of such recharge depends on the geology of the reservoir. In this work, we study how structural heterogeneities in the form of fractures impact the flow of lithium-carrying brine. Using a numerical simulation tool that gives high resolution of flow and transport in fractures and the host rock, we study how the presence of fractures influences energy and lithium production. Our simulations show that, due to heat conduction and the lack of mineral recharge from the rock, differences in fracture network geometries have a much larger impact on lithium production than energy production. The simulations thus confirm that in addition to the geochemical characterisation of lithium in geothermal brines, understanding fracture characterisation and its impact on production is highly important for lithium production.

Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode.

For closely spaced multiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the increase in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano matching. Methods are given for determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas from RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for antennas with known fields produced by an input current I. These Q(w) are remarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is available. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of origin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission lines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used to derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the bandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/Collin-Rothschild lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna supergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the recently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum gain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using the improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical size ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning overcome the traditional Chu lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies and small enough bandwidth power drops.         ",

Furthermore, the resulting cost considerably increases with the number of samples that is needed per THz waveform, an issue that has severely limited the widespread of the technique so far.

We present the performances of an experimental design, that uses only standard components (including dispersive devices), and a standard commercial probe laser without additional pulse broadening.

    "abstract": "           It has been shown that under high cylindrical confinement, two ring polymers with excluded volume interactions between monomers, segregate to two halves of the cylinder to maximize their entropy. In contrast, two ring polymers remain mixed within a sphere, as there is no symmetry breaking direction [Nat Rev Microbiol, 8, 600-607 (2010)]. Therefore, in order to observe emergent organization of ring polymers in a sphere, we can introduce an asymmetric topological modification to the polymer architecture by creating a small loop and a big loop within the ring polymer. We consider the bead-spring model of polymers where there are only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers ensuring that the organization we observe is purely entropy-driven. We find that for a single topologically modified polymer within a sphere, the monomers of the bigger loop are statistically more probable to be found closer to the periphery. However, the situation is reversed when we have multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. The monomers of the small loops are found closer to the walls of the sphere. We can increase this localization and radial organization of polymer segments by increasing the number of small loops in each ring polymer. We study how these loops interact with each other within a polymer, as well as with loops of other polymers in spherical confinement. We compare contact maps of multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. Finally, we discuss the plausible relevance of our studies to eukaryotic chromosomes that are confined within a spherical nucleus.         ",

It is shown that the computed values significantly reduce the photon second-order correlation function in the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The Radau method, an implicit Runge-Kutta method, has been employed, which provides more accurate results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a frequency detuning between the magnon and photon can result in deep values of photon blockade. Utilizing these optimized parameters outperforms scenarios that rely on constant, non-optimized values. This approach provides strong potential for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation.         ",

We first define a gate-based quantum circuit for the implementation of the CLB method and then exploit the sparse nature of the CLB matrix to build a quantum circuit based on block-encoding techniques which makes use of matrix oracles. It is shown that the gate complexity of the algorithm is thereby dramatically reduced, from exponential to quadratic. However, due to the need of employing up to seven ancilla qubits, the probability of success of the corresponding circuit for a single time step is too low to enable multi-step time evolution.

It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.         ",

    "abstract": "           Vacuum gap capacitors have recently gained considerable attention in superconducting circuit platforms due to their compact design and low dielectric losses in the microwave regime. Their ability to support mechanical vibrational modes makes them ideal candidates for circuit optomechanics. However, precise control of gap size and achieving high coherence in mechanical modes remain long-standing challenges. Here, we present a detailed fabrication process for scalable vacuum gap capacitors that support ultra-high-coherence mechanical motion, exhibit low microwave loss, and maintain a small footprint compared to planar geometries. We fabricate arrays of up to 24 LC resonators, with capacitors featuring nanometer-scale gap size variations. We demonstrate that the mechanical quality factors can reach up to $40 \\times 10^6$, a 100-fold improvement over other platforms, with microwave quality factors $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ at low photon number levels. This platform also achieves a sizable single-photon optomechanical coupling rate of approximately 20 Hz. Using this, we cooled the mechanical oscillator to its ground state (0.07 quanta) and squeezed its motion below the vacuum level by 2.7 dB. We further demonstrate the scalability of this platform by implementing large-scale optomechanical arrays, a strained graphene model, and observing quantum collective phenomena in a mechanical hexamer. These vacuum gap capacitors are promising candidates for coupling superconducting qubits with mechanical systems, serving as storage elements in quantum computing, and exploring gravitational effects on quantum mechanics.

By separately implementing wall-bounded turbulent and laminar inlet conditions, this work analysis various physical processes of flame stabilization and turbulence-flame interactions to study the influence of inflow boundary layer conditions. Findings indicate that combustion occurred within the cavity shear layer in both cases and propagated downstream along the lower wall. Also, the server impingement at the rear wall in the case with laminar inflow leads to greater cavity resistance. Furthermore, the studies on gas exchange and transport process indicates that with laminar inflow the entered gas accumulates in the back part of the cavity via the intensive mass exchange process and weaker interaction between the primary and secondary vortices. Flame stretch and thickness are further investigated to shed light into turbulence-flame interaction in supersonic flows. Findings indicates that the case with inflow wall-bounded turbulence show similar behaviours compared to previous studies, whereas the observed phenomena in front part of cavity shear layer are differ due to the presence of roll-up vortices in the case with laminar inflow. Overall, the influence of tangential strain rate and curvature are consistent with the preceding results and the evolution of flame thickness is caused by the combined effect of the two factors in both cases.

    "abstract": "           Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.

Spontaneously created photon pairs are emitted at symmetric angles with respect to the colinear pump direction, and the emission rate is largest if they have identical frequency. Thus, two orthogonally polarized pumps can produce polarization-entangled photon pairs through a mm-long homogeneous plasma. The noise from Raman scattering can be avoided if the pump detuning differs from twice the plasma frequency. On the other hand, pump detuning exactly equal to twice the plasma frequency can significantly enhance the interaction rate, which allows for the production of strong two-mode squeezed states. Remarkably, the amplified noise from Raman scattering are correlated and hence can be suppressed in one of the output quadratures, thereby maintaining the squeezing magnitude.         ",

We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator.

Our approach addresses these challenges by integrating laser feedback interferometry detection, achieving a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution compared to conventional reflectance confocal microscopy and a dramatic enhancement in axial resolution through precise interferometric phase measurements.

Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.         ",

Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.         ",

This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.
