    "abstract": "Hybrid photonic structures of plasmonic metasurfaces coupled to atomically thin semiconductors have emerged as a versatile platform for strong light-matter interaction, supporting both strong coupling and parametric nonlinearities. However, designing optimized nonlinear hybrid metasurfaces is a complex task, as the multiple parameters' contribution to the nonlinear response is elusive. Here we present a simple yet powerful strategy for maximizing the nonlinear response of the hybrid structures based on evolutionary inverse design of the metasurface's near-field enhancement around the excitonic frequency. We show that the strong coupling greatly enhances the nonlinear signal, and that its magnitude is mainly determined by the Rabi splitting, making it robust to geometrical variations of the metasurface. Furthermore, the large Rabi splitting attained by these hybrid structures enables broadband operation over the frequencies of the hybridized modes. Our results constitute a significant step towards achieving flexible nonlinear control, which can benefit applications in nonlinear frequency conversion, all-optical switching, and phase-controlled nonlinear metasurfaces.

    "abstract": "There has been remarkable recent progress in the formation of nano-resonators that support ultra-low-loss, compact dielectric photonic crystals with exceptional high-Q modes that operate at visible or telecom wavelengths. New insights into modal engineering have recently emerged from researchers exploring exotic electronic phases in 2D materials. The phenomenon relates to a twist in the angle between two layers of materials with high periodic spatial ordering, such as graphene. A moire pattern forms, and at a particular magic angle of twist, the electronic behavior significantly changes, enjoying a flat energy-momentum dispersion relationship. There is an optical analog to the electron twistronics: bilayer moire photonic crystal slabs can realize a flat-band condition. Under these conditions, the propagating modes have zero group velocity, thus giving rise to momentum-free trapping of Bloch waves in both transverse and vertical directions, creating high quality-factors and exceptionally small modal volumes that eventually lead to the enhancement of the Purcell effect. The dramatically different means of light-localization afforded by moire-structured cavities, very small mode volumes, and spatial determination by the overall moire pattern can manipulate spontaneous emission. This provides many opportunities for applications such as low-threshold lasing, single-photon source, quantum electrodynamics, photonic circuit, and quantum information processing. ",

    "abstract": "The degree of laser-induced graphitisation from a sp3-bonded to a sp2-bonded carbon fraction in a single crystal chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond under a varying fluence of an ultrashort pulsed laser (30 fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz) irradiation has been studied. The tetrahedral CVD sp3-phase was found to transition to primarily an sp2-aromatic crystalline graphitic fraction below the critical fluence of 3.9 J/cm2, above which predominantly an amorphous carbon was formed. A fractional increase of fluence from 3.3 J/cm2 to 3.9 J/cm2 (~ 20 %) resulted in a substantial (~ three-fold) increased depth of the sp2-graphitised areas owing to the non-linear interactions associated with an fs-laser irradiation. Additionally, formation of C=O carbonyl group was observed below the critical threshold fluence; the C=O cleavage occurred gradually with the increase of irradiation fluence of 30 fs laser light. The implications for these findings on enhancement of fs-driven processing of diamond are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations, classical force fields are supplemented with a kernel-based machine learning method trained on quantum-mechanical fragment energies. As an example application, a potential-energy surface is generalised for a small DNA duplex, taking into account explicit solvation and long-range electron exchange--correlation effects. Study of the corrected potential energy versus extension shows that leading classical DNA models have excessive stiffness with respect to stretching. This discrepancy is found to be common across multiple forcefields. The quantum correction is in qualitative agreement to the experimental thermodynamics for larger DNA double helices, providing a candidate explanation for the general and long-standing discrepancy between single molecule stretching experiments and classical calculations of DNA stretching. The new dataset of quantum calculations and the associated Kernel Modified Molecular Dynamics (KMMD) method should be of general utility in biomolecular simulations. KMMD is made available as part of the AMBER22 simulation software. ",

For instance, triple-junction III-V multijunction solar cells commonly use GaAs as a middle cell because of its near-perfect material quality, despite its bandgap being higher than optimal for the global spectrum. Here, we modify the GaAs bandgap using thick GaInAs/GaAsP strain-balanced quantum well (QW) solar cells with excellent voltage and absorption. These high-performance QWs are incorporated into a triple-junction inverted metamorphic multijunction device consisting of a GaInP top cell, GaInAs/GaAsP QW middle cell, and lattice-mismatched GaInAs bottom cell, each of which has been highly optimized. We demonstrate triple-junction efficiencies of 39.5% and 34.2% under the global and space spectra, respectively, which are higher than previous record six-junction devices. ",

This M source originates from a thin sheet of superfluid helium (SFHe), hence diagnostics and later measurements require a detection system which is operational in a dilution cryostat at temperatures below 1 K. In this paper, we describe the operation and characterization of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at ultra-low temperatures in SFHe targets. We show the temperature dependence of the signal shape, breakdown voltage, and single photon detection efficiency, concluding that single photon detection with SiPMs below 0.85 K is feasible. Furthermore, we show the development of segmented scintillation detectors, where 16 channels at 1.7 K and one channel at 170 mK were commissioned using a muon beam. ",

Many of these experiments however require a full characterization of the electric field, which typically requires a separate parametric optical process. As the central wavelength range of new sources continues to increase so too does the need for nonlinear crystals suited for characterizing these differing wavelengths. Here we report on the use of polycrystalline Zinc Selenide as a universal nonlinear crystal in the frequency resolved optical gating characterization technique from the near to long-wavelength infrared, capable of phase matching second-harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation over a decade of bandwidth, as well as ultra-broadband pulses, all of which being crystal orientation and input polarization independent. With the majority of ultra-fast laser sources being in this span of wavelengths, this work demonstrates a greatly simplified approach towards ultra-fast pulse characterization in the mid to long-wavelength infrared.

    "abstract": "The possibility of fine-tuning the couplings between optical modes is a key requirement in programmable photonic simulators and quantum computers. Engineering particle evolutions across large lattices is a challenging task, which requires sophisticated setups that are often intrinsically lossy. Here we report ultra-long photonic quantum walks across several hundred optical modes, obtained by propagating a light beam through very few closely-stacked liquid-crystal metasurfaces, without any optical amplification. By exploiting spin-orbit effects, these metasurfaces realize a space-dependent polarization transformation which mixes circularly polarized optical modes carrying quantized transverse momentum. With this setup we engineer quantum walks up to 320 discrete steps, far beyond state-of-the-art experiments. To showcase the potential of this method, we experimentally demonstrate that in the long-time limit a quantum walk affected by dynamical disorder generates maximal entanglement between two system partitions. Our platform grants experimental access to ultra-long unitary evolutions while keeping optical losses constant, thereby paving the way to massive multi-photon multi-mode quantum simulations. ",

However, the architectural computer archetype that enabled such a progress is approaching a state of more stagnant development. One of the most promising technological avenues for the continuing progress of quantum chemistry is the emerging quantum computing paradigm. This revolutionary proposal comes with several challenges, which span a wide array of disciplines. In chemistry, it implies, among other things, a need to reformulate some of its long established cornerstones in order to adjust to the operational demands and constraints of quantum computers. Due to its relatively recent emergence, much of quantum computing may still seem fairly nebulous and largely unknown to most chemists. It is in this context that here we review and illustrate the basic aspects of quantum information and their relation to quantum computing insofar as enabling simulations of quantum chemistry. We consider some of the most relevant developments in light of these aspects and discuss the current landscape when of relevance to quantum chemical simulations in quantum computers. ",

While the effects of phonons had historically been considered to be a hindrance, modern research has shown that phonons can be exploited due to their ability to couple to other excitations and consequently affect the thermal, dielectric, and electronic properties of solid state systems, greatly motivating the engineering of phononic structures. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed for structuring and phonon confinement even down to the nanoscale, drastically changing material properties. Despite developments in fabricating such nanoscale devices, the proper manipulation and characterization of phonons continues to be challenging. However, a fundamental understanding of these processes could enable the realization of key applications in diverse fields such as topological phononics, information technologies, sensing, and quantum electrodynamics, especially when integrated with existing electronic and photonic devices. Here, we highlight seven of the available methods for the excitation and detection of acoustic phonons and vibrations in solid materials, as well as advantages, disadvantages, and additional considerations related to their application. We then provide perspectives towards open challenges in nanophononics and how the additional understanding granted by these techniques could serve to enable the next generation of phononic technological applications.

Optical spectroscopy is a convenient indirect probe for changes in structural parameters with temperature and composition.
