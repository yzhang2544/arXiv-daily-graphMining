    "abstract": "Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) is an ever-maturing integrated platform for nonlinear optics. Yet, due to the absence of second-order ($\\chi^{(2)}$) nonlinearity, Si$_3$N$_4$ is mostly considered for third-order ($\\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinear interactions. Recently, this limitation was overcome by optical poling in both Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides and microresonators via the photogalvanic effect, resulting in the inscription of quasi-phase-matched $\\chi^{(2)}$ gratings. Here, we report cascaded nonlinear effects in a normal dispersion Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonator with combined $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that the photo-induced $\\chi^{(2)}$ grating also provides phase-matching for the sum-frequency generation process, enabling the initiation and successive switching of primary combs at pump wavelength. Additionally, the doubly resonant pump and second-harmonic fields allow for cascaded third-harmonic generation, where a secondary optically written $\\chi^{(2)}$ grating is identified. Finally, we reach a low-noise, broadband microcomb state evolved from the sum-frequency coupled primary comb. These results expand the scope of cascaded effects in $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ microresonators. ",

    "abstract": "Localized plasmons formed in ultrathin metallic nanogaps can lead to robust absorption of incident light. Plasmonic metasurfaces based on this effect can efficiently generate energetic charge carriers, also known as hot electrons, owing to their ability to squeeze and enhance electromagnetic fields in confined subwavelength spaces. However, it is very challenging to accurately identify and quantify the dynamics of hot carriers, mainly due to their ultrafast time decay. Their non-equilibrium temperature response is one of the key factors missing to understand the short time decay and overall transient tunable absorption performance of gap-plasmon metasurfaces. Here, we systematically study the temperature dynamics of hot electrons and their transition into thermal carriers at various timescales from femto to nanoseconds by using the two-temperature model. Additionally, the hot electron temperature and generation rate threshold values are investigated by using a hydrodynamic nonlocal model approach that is more accurate when ultrathin gaps are considered. The derived temperature dependent material properties are used to study the ultrafast transient nonlinear modification in the absorption spectrum before plasmon-induced lattice heating is established leading to efficient tunable nanophotonic absorber designs. We also examine the damage threshold of these plasmonic absorbers under various pulsed laser illuminations, an important quantity to derive the ultimate input intensity limits that can be used in various emerging nonlinear optics and other tunable nanophotonic applications. The presented results elucidate the role of hot electrons in the response of gap-plasmon metasurface absorbers which can be used to design more efficient photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and photodetection devices.

These superconducting detectors offer significant advantages: simple and robust fabrication, intrinsic multiplexing that will allow thousands of detectors to be read out with a single microwave line, and simple and low cost room temperature electronics. These strengths make KIDs especially attractive for HEP science via mm-wave cosmological studies. Examples of these potential cosmological observations include studying cosmic acceleration (Dark Energy) through measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, precision cosmology through ultra-deep measurements of small-scale CMB anisotropy, and mm-wave spectroscopy to map out the distribution of cosmological structure at the largest scales and highest redshifts. The principal technical challenge for these kinds of projects is the successful deployment of large-scale high-density focal planes -- a need that can be addressed by KID technology. In this paper, we present an overview of microstrip-coupled KIDs for use in mm-wave observations and outline the research and development needed to advance this class of technology and enable these upcoming large-scale experiments.

We applied ultrafast laser stress figuring (ULSF) to four thin fused silica mirrors to correct them to 10-20 nm RMS over 28 Zernike terms, in 2-3 iterations, without significantly affecting higher-frequency errors. We measured the mirrors over a month and found that dielectric-coated mirrors were stable but stability of aluminum-coated mirrors was inconclusive. The accuracy and throughput for ULSF is on par with existing deterministic figuring processes, yet ULSF doesn't significantly affect mid-spatial frequency errors, can be applied after mirror coating, and can scale to higher throughput using mature laser processing technologies. ULSF offers new potential to rapidly and accurately shape freeform mirrors. ",

In both approaches, the gigahertz-frequency SAWs are routed by integrated acoustic waveguides while on-chip microheaters are used to locally change the temperature and thus control the phase of SAW. Using this approach, we achieved phase changes of over 720 degrees with the responsibility of 2.6 deg/mW for bulk lithium niobate and 0.52 deg/mW for lithium niobate on sapphire. Furthermore, we demonstrated amplitude modulation of SAWs using acoustic Mach Zehnder interferometers.

When the effective coverage was high, the near-infrared light reflection was reduced by at least 20% in both nanoparticle arrangement and shape randomness compared to the hexagonal close-packed perfect metasurface. In contrast, when effective coverage was low, the randomness of the nanoparticle arrangement had almost no effect on the near-infrared light reflection.

This procedure requires a-priori knowledge of the initial focusing function, which can be interpreted as the inverse of a transmitted wavefield as it would propagate through the medium, excluding (multiply) reflected waveforms. In practice, the initial focusing function is often replaced by a time-reversed direct wave, which is computed with help of a macro velocity model. Green's functions that are retrieved under this (direct-wave) approximation typically lack forward-scattered waveforms and their associated multiple reflections. We examine whether this problem can be mitigated by incorporating transmission data. Based on these transmission data, we derive an auxiliary equation for the forward-scattered components of the initial focusing function. We demonstrate that this equation can be solved in an acoustic medium with mass density contrast and constant propagation velocity. By solving the auxiliary and Marchenko equation successively, we can include forward-scattered waveforms in our Green's function estimates, as we demonstrate with a numerical example. ",

    "abstract": "Liquid dye lasers have long been considered as ideal tunable laser sources in the visible range but are bulky, expensive, and require a complex system for dye circulation. Here, we present a system that relies on a low-cost blue laser diode as the pump source and a sealed dye cell with no flowing circuitry, resulting in a device that combines the convenience and size of a solid-state device with the stability of a liquid organic laser. A very high photo-stability is obtained (up to 1.2 x 10$^9$ pulses or 12 days at 1 kHz), which is five orders of magnitude higher than a solid-state dye laser operated in similar conditions. The number of pulses obtainable at low repetition rates is found to be limited by molecular self-diffusion and, hence, related to the total cuvette volume. In contrast, the repetition rate is limited to a few kHz, which suggests that thermal effects play a bigger role than triplet population effects. Thermal effects participate in the suppression of lasing through the buildup of a strong negative thermal lens; correcting the non-aberrant part of this thermal lens by resonator design enables the repetition rate to be pushed up to 14 kHz with possible further optimization. This work shows a route for building off-the-shelf, compact, low-cost, and convenient tunable pulsed lasers in the visible range that have superior stability over organic solid-state lasers. ",

The superior temporal and spectral resolution, has brought forth pump-probe spectroscopy for ultrafast dynamic study of transient states in various intriguing materials, such as quantum materials, metamaterials, and plasmonic materials, by directly reporting spectroscopic complex response function, using either time- or frequency-domain- based probes. In stark contrast to its frequency-domain counterparts, e.g., FTIR and ellipsometry, time-domain spectroscopy outstands by providing not only superb spectroscopic phase sensitivity but also exceptional temporal resolution due to its pulsed nature. To extend detection range of time-domain spectroscopy into the challenging visible frequencies, we propose an interferometry-type frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG). Our numerical simulation shows, when operating in a carefully engineered double-pulse scheme, a unique phase-locking mechanism can be activated, and therefore preserves both zero- and first-order phases, that are otherwise inaccessible to standard FROG measurement. Followed by time-domain signal reconstruction and analysis protocol, we show that time-domain spectroscopy with subcycle temporal resolution is enabled and well suits the need of ultrafast-compatible and ambiguity-free method for complex dielectric function measurement at visible wavelengths.

Such platforms can tackle a vast area of real-life tasks ranging from image processing to language translation. Silicon photonic integrated chips (PICs), by employing coherent interactions in Mach-Zehnder interferometers, are promising accelerators offering record low power consumption and ultra-fast matrix multiplication. Such photonic accelerators, however, suffer from phase uncertainty due to fabrication errors and crosstalk effects that inhibit the development of high-density implementations. In this work, we present a Bayesian learning framework for such photonic accelerators. In addition to the conventional log-likelihood optimization path, two novel training schemes are derived, namely a regularized version and a fully Bayesian learning scheme. They are applied on a photonic neural network with 512 phase shifters targeting the MNIST dataset. The new schemes, when combined with a pre-characterization stage that provides the passive offsets, are able to dramatically decrease the operational power of the PIC beyond 70%, with just a slight loss in classification accuracy. The full Bayesian scheme, apart from this energy reduction, returns information with respect to the sensitivity of the phase shifters. This information is used to de-activate 31% of the phase actuators and, thus, significantly simplify the driving system. ",

Here we show the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and quantum correlation (Hanbury Brown and Twiss) measurements as a function of polarization for one- and two-emitter systems. The sample was made by implanting low concentrations of adenine (C5H5N5) into a low nitrogen chemical vapor deposition diamond.

Therefore, we have developed a framework for the automated discovery of semiconductor host platforms for QT using material informatics and machine learning methods, resulting in a dataset consisting of over $25.000$ materials and nearly $5000$ physics-informed features. Three approaches were devised, named the Ferrenti, extended Ferrenti and the empirical approach, to label data for the supervised machine learning (ML) methods logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting. We find that of the three, the empirical approach relying exclusively on findings from the literature predicted substantially fewer candidates than the other two approaches with a clear distinction between suitable and unsuitable candidates when comparing the two largest eigenvalues in the covariance matrix. In contrast to expectations from the literature and that found for the Ferrenti and extended Ferrenti approaches focusing on band gap and ionic character, the ML methods from the empirical approach highlighted features related to symmetry and crystal structure, including bond length, orientation and radial distribution, as influential when predicting a material as suitable for QT. All three approaches and all four ML methods agreed on a subset of $47$ eligible candidates %(to a probability of $>50 \\ \\%$) of $8$ elemental, $29$ binary, and $10$ tertiary compounds, and provide a basis for further material explorations towards quantum technology.

    "title": "Does Science need Intersubjectivity? The Problem of Confirmation in  Orthodox Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics",
    "abstract": "Any successful interpretation of quantum mechanics must explain how our empirical evidence allows us to come to know about quantum mechanics. In this article, we argue that this vital criterion is not met by the class of 'orthodox interpretations,' which includes QBism, neo-Copenhagen interpretations, and some versions of relational quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that intersubjectivity fails in radical ways in these approaches, and we explain why intersubjectivity matters for empirical confirmation. We take a detailed look at the way in which belief-updating might work in the kind of universe postulated by an orthodox interpretation, and argue that observers in such a universe are unable to escape their own perspective in order to learn about the structure of the set of perspectives that is supposed to make up reality according to these interpretations. We also argue that in some versions of these interpretations it is not even possible to use one's own relative frequencies for empirical confirmation. Ultimately we conclude that it cannot be rational to believe these sorts of interpretations unless they are supplemented with some observer-independent structure which underwrites intersubjective agreement in at least certain sorts of cases.
