    "abstract": "Some of the biggest achievements of the modern era of particle physics, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson, have been made possible by the tremendous effort in building and operating large-scale experiments like the Large Hadron Collider or the Tevatron. In these facilities, the ultimate theory to describe matter at the most fundamental level is constantly probed and verified. These experiments often produce large amounts of data that require storing, processing, and analysis techniques that often push the limits of traditional information processing schemes. Thus, the High-Energy Physics (HEP) field has benefited from advancements in information processing and the development of algorithms and tools for large datasets. More recently, quantum computing applications have been investigated in an effort to understand how the community can benefit from the advantages of quantum information science. In this manuscript, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art applications of quantum computing to data analysis in HEP, discuss the challenges and opportunities in integrating these novel analysis techniques into a day-to-day analysis workflow, and whether there is potential for a quantum advantage.

    "abstract": "Particle accelerators and storage rings have been transformative instruments of discovery, and, for many applications, innovations in particle-beam cooling have been a principal driver of that success1. Beam cooling reduces the spread in particle positions and momenta, while keeping the number of particles constant, and combats diffusive effects, thereby enabling particle accumulation and the production and preservation of intense beams. In the case of particle colliders, cooling increases the likelihood of observing rare physics events. One of the most important conceptual and technological advances in this area was stochastic cooling (SC), which was instrumental in the discovery of the W and Z bosons at CERN and the top quark at Fermilab2-6. SC reduces the random motion of the beam particles through granular sampling and correction of the beams phase-space structure, thus bearing resemblance to a Maxwells demon. The extension of SC from the microwave regime up to optical frequencies and bandwidths has long been pursued as it could increase the achievable cooling rates by three to four orders of magnitude and provide a powerful new tool for future accelerators. First proposed nearly thirty years ago, Optical Stochastic Cooling (OSC) replaces the conventional microwave elements of SC with optical-frequency analogs and is, in principle, compatible with any species of charged-particle beam7,8. Here we describe the first experimental demonstration of OSC in a proof-of-principle experiment9 at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratorys Integrable Optics Test Accelerator10. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate lateral recoil forces exerted on nanoparticles located near plasmonic platforms with in-plane nonreciprocal response. We derive approximate analytical expressions for these forces, demonstrating their explicit dependence on the dispersion relation that characterizes the system and unveiling the mechanisms that govern them. In particular, a dominant force component appears due to the momentum imbalance of nonreciprocal surface plasmons excited on the platform surface. This force can be orders of magnitude larger than other recoil forces, acts only along or against the direction of the external bias, and is quasi-independent of the direction, polarization, and wavelength of the incident plane wave. Lateral recoil forces are explored using drift-biased graphene metasurfaces, a platform that is also proposed to sort nanoparticles as a function of their size. Nonreciprocal plasmonic systems may enable new venues to trap, bind, and manipulate nanoparticles and to alleviate some of the challenges of conventional optical tweezers. ",

In addition, it is found that the amplitudes of all magnetic components increase with respect to the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure \\b{eta} and safety factor q.

    "abstract": "Memristor-based neuromorphic computing systems address the memory-wall issue in von Neumann architecture that prevents the efficient training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Nevertheless, emerging memristor devices, with the existence of several non-idealities, such as poor yield and limited number of reliable conductance states, are still not mature for practical neuromorphic systems. At the same time, the mainstream neuromorphic DNNs utilize the error backpropagation-based gradient descent algorithm, requiring ideal synaptic behavior of the memristive devices and complex neural circuits. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the training of a memristive restricted Boltzmann machine (memristive RBM) and deep belief neural network (memristive DBN) that employ memristor devices fabricated in a commercial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process as artificial synapses and utilize the gradient descent algorithm based on contrastive divergence (CD). The memristor devices are based on the floating gate (FG) principle, showing analog tunability, high endurance, long retention time, predictable cycling degradation, moderate device-to-device variations, high yield, and two orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency for multiply-accumulate operations than today's graphical processing units. The CD-based gradient descent algorithm highly relaxes both the requirements of the synaptic behavior for the memristor devices and the complexity of the neuron circuits. Two 12-by-8 arrays of FG memristors are utilized to demonstrate the training of an RBM intended for pattern recognition. We then benchmark an extrapolated memristive DBN consisting of three memristive RBMs for the MNIST dataset, showing a recognition accuracy up to 97.05%. The designed memristive RBM and DBN have minimal neuron circuits where no digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters are needed. ",

Analogies to statistical mechanics models of interacting classical spins, built upon the correspondence between complex-valued modes and two-component spins, are employed to define two-component and single-component order parameters. A comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate critical points and exponents of a second-order phase transition, driven by the optical energy per mode. Equilibrium properties of the system are compared to exact results whenever applicable. Considering various parameter settings, our results confirm the mean-field nature of the transition and establish the critical line in the nonlinearity--energy-density phase diagram. Critical scaling leads to infer the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$. Connection to thermodynamic quantities is established by means of a kinetic temperature with appropriate zero-temperature limit. In the low temperature phase (low energy per mode), spins align. In the high temperature phase (large energy per mode), spins rotate independent of one another. ",

We report the experimental evidence showing the profound physical relation between the polarization degree of light emitted by the doped ion and the lattice symmetry, by demonstrating, with unprecedented precision, that the lattice constant ratio c/a directly quantifies the macroscopic effective polar angle of the electric and magnetic dipoles, which essentially determines the linear polarization degree of the emission. Based on this discovery, we further propose a pure optical technology to identify the three-dimensional orientation of a rod-shaped single microcrystal using the polarization-resolved micro-spectroscopy. Our results, revealing the physical origin of light polarization in ion-doped crystals, open the way towards on-demand polarization control with crystallography, and provide a versatile platform for polarization-based microscale sensing in dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "A non-perturbative model for graphene optical nonlinearity is developed for the study of ultrafast pulse propagation along a monolayer, as in the case of graphene-comprising nanophotonic integrated waveguides. This graphene `hot electron' model (GHEM) builds upon earlier work, based on the Fermi-Dirac framework for 2D semiconductors, which was aimed mainly at steady-state absorptive response of a monolayer under free-space laser-beam illumination. Our extension adapts the GHEM to in-plane light-matter interaction along graphene monolayers under intense ps-pulse excitation that leads to the carrier-density saturation regime. We first provide a quantitative overview of the `classic' perturbative third-order nonlinear response and then study the static and transient response of graphene as a function of the GHEM parameters, with focus on the monolayer quality and voltage-tunability. These results are compared to phenomenological models for saturable absorption and nonlinear refraction, showing good agreement with recent experimental works. In conclusion, the GHEM unifies the experimentally observed absorptive and refractive optical nonlinearities in a single multi-parametric framework therefore enabling the evaluation of the voltage-tunable light-matter interaction in structures such as diffraction-limited nanophotonic waveguides. This formalism can be readily employed to THz frequencies, adapted to multi-channel (e.g. pump-probe) nonlinear effects, or developed to include carrier and lattice-temperature diffusion to extend its validity threshold.

The framework is mainly built upon five basic assumptions, which loosely speaking have the following contents. (i) The state space of each mode is given by the direct product of a momentum-state space and a spinor-state space, the latter of which is certain representation space of the $SL(2,C)$ group (a covering group of the Lorentz group); (ii) spinor states of modes have a layer-type structure and modes are either fermionic or bosonic, depending on their helicity properties; (iii) there are three fundamental processes -- free evolution, vacuum fluctuation (emergence or vanishing of a pair of fermionic modes that possess exactly opposite physical properties), and two fundamental interaction processes (change of two fermionic modes into one bosonic mode and the reverse); (iv) vacuum fluctuation happens instantly; and (v) the time evolution operator is constructed from operators, which map state spaces of incoming modes of fundamental processes to those of outgoing modes. The time evolution operator turns out to be a function of quantum fields that are constructed from creation and annihilation operators for free-mode states, whose interaction part has a local feature. As an example, a simple model of modes is studied and is compared with the first-generation part of the standard model (SM). Concerning electroweak interactions, the studied model has a time evolution operator, whose main body is formally similar to that of the SM. Besides, it predicts $\\frac 13$ and $\\frac 23$ electronic changes for quark-type modes, gives an interpretation to the color degree of freedom, and contains certain modes that behave like dark matters.

    "abstract": "Certifying individual quantum devices with minimal assumptions is crucial for the development of quantum technologies. Here, we investigate how to leverage single-system contextuality to realize self-testing. We develop a robust self-testing protocol based on the simplest contextuality witness for the simplest contextual quantum system, the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) inequality for the qutrit. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the state and the measurements (to an ideal configuration) as a function of the value of the witness under a pragmatic assumption on the measurements we call the KCBS orthogonality condition. We apply the method in an experiment with randomly chosen measurements on a single trapped $^{40}{\\rm Ca}^+$ and near-perfect detection efficiency. The observed statistics allow us to self-test the system and provide the first experimental demonstration of quantum self-testing of a single system. Further, we quantify and report that deviations from our assumptions are minimal, an aspect previously overlooked by contextuality experiments. ",

    "abstract": "We derive an equivalent traveling wave form description for Dirac field. In the non-relativistic limit, such form can reduce to inverse-Galilean transformed Schrodinger-type equation. We find that, the resulting two-component Schrodinger-type equation from the reduction of traveling wave form description of Dirac field is different to the naive Galilean transformed Schrodinger equation. Taking into account the interactions of the system to electromagnetic field by adding proper forms of covariant derivative, the traveling wave form description for Pauli equation can be similarly obtained in the non-relativistic limit. Such descriptions allow one to choose arbitrary convenient reference frame for quantum system involving spins. Using Bargmann-Wigner formalism for field with arbitrary spin $s\\geq 1/2$, which satisfy Dirac-type equations in all its indices, the traveling wave description for such a field can be similarly obtained from the traveling wave form description of Dirac field, for example, for the spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger field and spin-2 gravitational field.

These recently proposed lattices have sites with alternating helicity which exert a discriminatory force on chiral molecules with different handedness. We find that a strong dipole-dipole repulsion between molecules results in the polarization of left and right enantiomers. In an experiment, this would produce a phase separation of enantiomers, acting as an alternative route towards chiral discrimination. ",

The result shows a stable circulating total current density with a donut shaped topography for the eigenstate electron inside a quantum well. The spin value inside the well is modified by the confining geometry. Our analysis also shows that a free electron Gaussian wave packet is unstable and experiences quick decoherence. The impacts of the wave spin on quantum computing and quantum information technologies are discussed in principle. ",

    "title": "Beyond the Limitation of Pulse Width in Optical Time-domain  Reflectometry",
    "abstract": "Optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) is the basis for distributed time-domain optical fiber sensing techniques. By injecting pulse light into an optical fiber, the distance information of an event can be obtained based on the time of light flight. The minimum distinguishable event separation along the fiber length is called the spatial resolution, which is determined by the optical pulse width. By reducing the pulse width, the spatial resolution can be improved. However, at the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system is degraded, and higher speed equipment is required. To solve this problem, data processing methods such as iterative subdivision, deconvolution, and neural networks have been proposed. However, they all have some shortcomings and thus have not been widely applied. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an OTDR deconvolution neural network based on deep convolutional neural networks. A simplified OTDR model is built to generate a large amount of training data. By optimizing the network structure and training data, an effective OTDR deconvolution is achieved. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed neural network can achieve more accurate deconvolution than the conventional deconvolution algorithm with a higher signal-to-noise ratio.

    "abstract": "The applications of spin-based quantum sensors to measurements probing fundamental physics are surveyed. Experimental methods and technologies developed for quantum information science have rapidly advanced in recent years, and these tools enable increasingly precise control and measurement of spin dynamics. Theories of beyond-the-Standard-Model physics predict, for example, symmetry violating electromagnetic moments aligned with particle spins, exotic spin-dependent forces, coupling of spins to ultralight bosonic dark matter fields, and changes to the local environment that affect spins. Spin-based quantum sensors can be used to search for these myriad phenomena, and offer a methodology for tests of fundamental physics that is complementary to particle colliders and large scale particle detectors. Areas of technological development that can significantly enhance the sensitivity of spin-based quantum sensors to new physics are highlighted. ",
