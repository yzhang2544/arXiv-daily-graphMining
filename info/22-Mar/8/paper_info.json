    "abstract": "In an expansion of a previous study [1], we apply inverse design methods to produce two-dimensional plasma metamaterial devices with realistic plasma elements which incorporate quartz envelopes, collisionality (loss), non-uniform density profiles, and resistance to experimental error/perturbation. Backpropagated finite difference frequency domain simulations are used to design waveguides and demultiplexers operating under the transverse magnetic polarization. Optimal devices with realistic elements are compared to previous devices with idealized elements, and several parameter initialization schemes for the optimization algorithm are explored. Demultiplexing and waveguiding are demonstrated for microwave-regime devices composed of plasma elements with reasonable space-averaged plasma frequencies ~10 GHz and a collision frequency ~1 GHz, allowing for future in-situ training and experimental realization of these designs.

    "title": "Theoretical study of laser intensity noise effect on CW-STED microscopy",
    "abstract": "Spatial resolution of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy varies with sample labeling techniques and microscope components, e.g., lasers, lenses, and photo-detectors. Fluctuations in the intensity of the depletion laser decrease achievable resolution in STED microscopy; the stronger the fluctuations, the higher the average intensity needed to achieve a given resolution. This phenomenon is encountered in every STED measurement. However, a theoretical framework that evaluates the effect of intensity fluctuations on spatial resolution is lacking. This article presents an analytical formulation based on a stochastic model that characterizes the impact of the laser fluctuations and correlation time on the depletion efficiency in the continuous wave (CW) STED microscopy. We compared analytical results with simulations using a wide range of intensity noise conditions and found a high degree of agreement. The stochastic model used considers a colored noise distribution for the laser intensity fluctuations. Simple analytical expressions were obtained in the limit of small and large fluctuations correlation time. These expressions fitted very well the available experimental data. Finally, this work offers a starting point to model other laser noise effects in various microscopy implementations. ",

    "abstract": "In classical viscous fluids, turbulent eddies are known to be responsible for the rapid spreading of embedded particles. But in an inviscid quantum fluid where the turbulence is induced by a chaotic tangle of quantized vortices, dispersion of the particles is achieved via a non-classical mechanism, i.e., their binding to the evolving quantized vortices. However, there is limited existing knowledge on how the vortices diffuse and spread in turbulent quantum fluids. Here we report a systematic numerical study of the apparent diffusion of vortices in a random vortex tangle in superfluid helium-4 using full Biot-Savart simulation. We reveal that the vortices in pure superfluid exhibit a universal anomalous diffusion (superdiffusion) at small times, which transits to normal diffusion at large times. This behavior is found to be caused by a generic scaling property of the vortex velocity, which should exist in all quantum fluids where the Biot-Savart law governs the vortex motion. Our simulation at finite temperatures also nicely reproduces recent experimental observations. The knowledge obtained from this study may form the foundation for understanding turbulent transport and universal vortex dynamics in various condensed-matter and cosmic quantum fluids. ",

For a collection of liquid-phase water molecules resonantly coupled to a single lossless cavity mode, the simulation shows that, as compared with a fully classical calculation, the inclusion of nuclear and photonic quantum effects does not lead to a change in the Rabi splitting but does broaden polaritonic linewidths roughly by a factor of two. Moreover, under thermal equilibrium, both quantum and classical simulations predict that the static dielectric constant of liquid water is largely unchanged inside versus outside the cavity. This result disagrees with a recent experiment demonstrating that the static dielectric constant of liquid water can be resonantly enhanced under VSC, suggesting either limitations of our approach or perhaps other experimental factors that have not yet been explored.

We discuss the influence of graphene and the DM on the hysteretic response of the TM-polarized reflected light. It is found that the switch-up and switch-down threshold required to observe the optical bistable behavior are lowered markedly due to the excitation of the TP and DM. Besides, the switching threshold value can be further reduced by coupling the TP and DM.

Despite the rapid development of PVOT and the achievement of high-quality 1D and 2D particle patterning, research efforts aimed at the fabrication of combinatorial structures made up of multiple types of particles have been scarce. Here, we have established the working principles of three different methods to tackle this pending challenge. To that end, dielectrophoresis and/or electrophoresis acting on neutral and charged particles respectively, have been suitably exploited. Simple mixed structures combining metallic and dielectric nanoparticles of different sizes have been successfully obtained.

    "abstract": "Mobile medical imaging devices are invaluable for clinical diagnostic purposes both in and outside healthcare institutions. Among the various imaging modalities, only a few are readily portable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the gold standard for numerous healthcare conditions, does not traditionally belong to this group. Recently, low-field MRI start-up companies have demonstrated the first decisive steps towards portability within medical facilities, but these are so far incompatible with more demanding use cases such as in remote and developing regions, sports facilities and events, medical and military camps, or home healthcare. Here we present in vivo images taken with a light, home-made, low-field extremity MRI scanner outside the controlled environment provided by medical facilities. To demonstrate the true portability of the system and benchmark its performance in various relevant scenarios, we have acquired images of a volunteer's knee in: i) an MRI physics laboratory; ii) an office room; iii) outside a campus building, connected to a nearby power outlet; iv) in open air, powered from a small fuel-based generator; and v) at the volunteer's home. All images have been acquired within clinically viable times, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and tissue contrast suffice for 2D and 3D reconstructions with diagnostic value, with comparable overall image quality across all five situations. Furthermore, the volunteer carries a fixation metallic implant screwed to the femur, which leads to strong artifacts in standard clinical systems but appears sharp in our low-field acquisitions. Altogether, this work opens a path towards highly accessible MRI under circumstances previously unrealistic. ",

Given the rising importance of Magnetic resonance (MR) only treatment planning workflows, we sought to determine if an ML based treatment planning model, trained on computed tomography (CT) imaging, could be applied to MR through domain adaptation. Methods: In this study, MR and CT imaging was collected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator. ML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using a commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and acceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional dose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT plans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain components. Results: MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all evaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for all evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and large bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p<0.05). Changing the input imaging modality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric differences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between the ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a significant contributor. Significance: We were able to create highly acceptable MR based treatment plans using a CT-trained ML model for treatment planning, although clinically significant dose deviations from the CT based plans were observed.

Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. This work develops a formal framework to address this issue by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model with two system states demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the present approach. ",

The intercalation of Li-ions into oxides can further lead to emergent electronic property changes. Some of the fastest Li-ion conductors are 4d oxides, and of these, the niobium oxide polymorph T-Nb2O5 is especially interesting with its two-dimensional fast ion migration channels. However, the growth of single-crystalline T-Nb2O5 films is challenging due to its stability over only a limited synthesis temperature window, the existence of many other polymorphs, and its large orthorhombic unit cell. Here, we first demonstrate the epitaxial growth of single domain T-Nb2O5 thin films, critically with the ion channels oriented perpendicular to the film's surface. We show that the insertion of just a small amount of Li using ionic liquids results in conversion of the initially insulating film to a metallic state with a colossal change in resistivity of almost eleven orders of magnitude. In situ experiments, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, reveal a series of transitions between distinct crystal and electronic structures as the lithium content is systematically increased. These include hidden phases that have not previously been identified. Furthermore, replacing the Au electrode with a Li-oxide electrode allows for a significant reduction of the gate voltage at which metallization takes place. Our study opens a new path towards the exploration of hidden phases and the development of novel electrochemically controlled electronic devices. ",

    "title": "Periodic orbits in the 1:2:3 resonant chain and their impact on the  orbital dynamics of the planetary system Kepler-51",
    "abstract": "Many exoplanets evolving in (or close) to MMRs and resonant chains have been discovered by space missions. Oftentimes, the published data possess very large uncertainties, due to observational limitations, which deem the system chaotic in short or large timescales. We propose a study of the dynamics of such systems by exploring particular regions in phase space. We exemplify our method by studying the long-term orbital stability of the three-planet system Kepler-51 and either favor or constrain its data. It is a dual process which breaks down in two steps: the computation of the families of periodic orbits in the 1:2:3 resonant chain and the visualization of the phase space through maps of dynamical stability. We present novel results in the General 4-Body Problem. Stable periodic orbits were found only in the low-eccentricity regime. We demonstrate three possible scenarios safeguarding Kepler-51, each followed by constraints. Firstly, the 2/1 and 3/2 two-body MMRs, in which $e_b<0.02$, so that such two-body MMRs last for long-time spans. Secondly, the 1:2:3 three-body Laplace-like resonance, in which $e_c<0.016$ and $e_d<0.006$ for such a chain to be viable. Thirdly, the combination comprising an 1/1 secondary resonance inside 2/1 MMR for the inner pair of planets and an apsidal difference oscillation for the outer pair of planets in which the observational eccentricities $e_b$ and $e_c$ are favored as long as $e_d\\approx 0$. Aiming to the optimum deduction of the orbital elements, this study showcases the need for dynamical analyses based on periodic orbits being performed in parallel to the fitting processes. ",

    "title": "Multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes in stars: A general analytical  resonance condition",
    "abstract": "Asteroseismology has proven to be a powerful method for probing stellar interiors. Analytical descriptions of the global oscillation modes, in combination with pulsation codes, have provided valuable help in processing and interpreting the large amount of seismic data collected by the CoRoT, $Kepler$, and TESS missions. These prior results have paved the way to more in-depth analyses of the oscillation spectra of stars, which requires innovative theoretical descriptions of stellar oscillations. In this paper, we aim to analytically express the resonance condition of the spheroidal adiabatic oscillation modes in a very general way, applicable at different evolutionary stages. In the present formulation, a star is represented as an acoustic interferometer composed of a multitude of resonant cavities where waves can propagate and the short-wavelength JWKB approximation is met. Each cavity is separated from the adjacent ones by barriers, which corresponds to regions either where waves are evanescent or where the JWKB approximation fails. The stationary modes are computed using two different physical representations: 1) the infinite-time reflections picture 2) the linear boundary value problem picture. Both provide the same resonance condition, which ultimately turns out to depend on a number of parameters: the reflection and transmission phase lags introduced by each barrier, the coupling factor associated with each barrier, and the wave number integral over each resonant cavity. Using such a formulation, we can retrieve the usual forms derived in previous works (e.g., mixed modes with two or three cavities, low- and large-amplitude glitches). This resonance condition provides a new tool that is useful in predicting the stellar oscillation spectra and interpret seismic observations at different evolutionary stages. Practical applications are left to future work. ",

    "title": "Steady-state microwave mode cooling with a diamond NV ensemble",
    "abstract": "A fundamental result of quantum mechanics is that the fluctuations of a bosonic field are given by its temperature $T$. An electromagnetic mode with frequency $\\omega$ in the microwave band has a significant thermal photon occupation at room temperature according to the Bose-Einstein distribution $\\bar{n} = k_BT / \\hbar\\omega$. The room temperature thermal state of a 3 GHz mode, for example, is characterized by a mean photon number $\\bar{n} \\sim 2000$ and variance $\\Delta n^2 \\approx \\bar{n}^2$. This thermal variance sets the measurement noise floor in applications ranging from wireless communications to positioning, navigation, and timing to magnetic resonance imaging. We overcome this barrier in continuously cooling a ${\\sim} 3$ GHz cavity mode by coupling it to an ensemble of optically spin-polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a room-temperature diamond. The NV spins are pumped into a low entropy state via a green laser and act as a heat sink to the microwave mode through their collective interaction with microwave photons. Using a simple detection circuit we report a peak noise reduction of $-2.1 \\pm 0.1 \\, \\textrm{dB}$ and minimum cavity mode temperature of $178.3 \\pm 5.4 \\textrm{K}$. We present also a linearized model to identify the important features of the cooling, and demonstrate its validity through magnetically tuned, spectrally resolved measurements. The realization of efficient mode cooling at ambient temperature opens the door to applications in precision measurement and communication, with the potential to scale towards fundamental quantum limits.
