    "abstract": "Dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) frequency combs - also known as microcombs - have arguably created a new field in cavity nonlinear photonics, with a strong cross-fertilization between theoretical, experimental, and technological research. Spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) not only add new degrees of freedom to ultrafast laser technology, but also provide new insights for implementing analogue computers and heuristic optimizers with photonics. Here, we combine the principles of DKS and STML for the first time to demonstrate the STML DKS by developing an unexplored ultrahigh-quality-factor Fabry-Perot microresonator based on graded index multimode fiber (GRIN-MMF). Using the intermodal stimulated Brillouin scattering, we can selectively excite either the eigenmode DKS or the STML DKS. Furthermore, we demonstrate an ultralow noise microcomb that enhances the photonic flywheel performance in both the fundamental comb linewidth and DKS timing jitter. The demonstrated fundamental comb linewidth of 400 mHz and DKS timing jitter of 500 attosecond represent improvements of 25x and 2.5x, respectively, from the state-of-the-art. Our results show the potential of GRIN-MMF FP microresonators as an ideal testbed for high-dimensional nonlinear cavity dynamics and photonic flywheel with ultrahigh coherence and ultralow timing jitter.

    "abstract": "The next generation of wireless networks is expected to tap into the terahertz (0.1--10 THz) band to satisfy the extreme latency and bandwidth density requirements of future applications. However, the development of systems in this band is challenging as THz waves confront severe spreading and penetration losses, as well as molecular absorption, which leads to strong line-of-sight requirements through highly directive antennas. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed to address issues derived from non-line-of-sight propagation, among other impairments, by redirecting the incident wave toward the receiver and implementing virtual-line-of-sight communications. However, the benefits provided by a RIS may be lost if the network operates at multiple bands. In this position paper, the suitability of the RIS paradigm in indoor THz scenarios for 6G is assessed grounded on the analysis of a tunable graphene-based RIS that can operate in multiple wideband transparency windows. A possible implementation of such a RIS is provided and numerically evaluated at 0.65/0.85/1.05 THz separately, demonstrating that beam steering and other relevant functionalities are realizable with excellent performance. Finally, the challenges associated with the design and fabrication of multi-wideband graphene-based RISs are discussed, paving the way to the concurrent control of multiple THz bands in the context of 6G networks.

Despite six decades of work, no acoustoelectric amplifier has been produced that can achieve a large net (terminal) gain at microwave frequencies with low power consumption and noise figure. Here we demonstrate a novel three-layer acoustoelectric heterostructure that enables the first-ever continuously operating acoustoelectric amplifier with terminal gain at gigahertz frequencies. We achieve a terminal gain of 11.25 dB in a 500 micron long device, operating at 1 GHz with a DC power dissipation of 19.6 mW. We also realize broadband gain from 0.25-3.4 GHz and nonreciprocal transmission exceeding 44 dB at 1 GHz. Our acoustic noise figure is 2.8 dB, which is the lowest ever demonstrated noise figure for an acoustoelectric amplifier. We discuss generally how to optimize these acoustoelectric heterostructures and show that it should be immediately achievable to produce devices with even larger gain in shorter lengths while simultaneously having lower power consumption and noise figure.

The model requires the action of a special type of detector that detects and records individual particles. According to our model, microscopic particles are classical entities that follow classical trajectories without nonlocal interactions between them. As long as they remain undetected, particles carry the information of a phase equal to an action integral along their trajectory. At the point of their detection, our special type of detector collects the phases from all particles reaching it, adds them up over time as complex numbers, and divides them by the square root of their number. The detector records a detection each time the square of the magnitude of the ensuing vector crosses an integer value.

Spiking dynamics appear due to the excitable nature of the system. In this context, excitable excursions in the phase space correspond to spikes in the temporal evolution of the field variables. In our case, excitability is mediated by the destruction of an oscillatory state in a global homoclinic bifurcation. In this type of excitability (known as type-I) the period of the oscillatory state diverges when approaching the bifurcation. Beyond this point, the system exhibits excitable dynamics under the application of suitable perturbations. We have also characterized the effect that additive Gaussian noise has on the spiking dynamics, showing that the system undergoes a coherence resonance for a given value of the noise strength. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic spectrographs offer a highly miniaturized, flexible, and stable on-chip solution for astronomical spectroscopy and can be used for various science cases such as determining the atmospheric composition of exoplanets to understand their habitability, formation, and evolution. Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) have shown the best promise to be used as an astrophotonic spectrograph. We developed a publically-available tool to conduct a preliminary examination of the capability of the AWGs in spectrally resolving exoplanet atmospheres. We derived the Line-Spread-Function (LSF) as a function of wavelength and the Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the LSF as a function of spectral line width to evaluate the response of a discretely- and continuously-sampled low-resolution AWG (R $\\sim$ 1000). We observed that the LSF has minimal wavelength dependence ($\\sim$5\\%), irrespective of the offset with respect to the center-wavelengths of the AWG channels, contrary to the previous assumptions. We further confirmed that the observed FWHM scales linearly with the emission line width. Finally, we present simulated extraction of a sample molecular absorption spectrum with the discretely- and continuously-sampled low-resolution AWGs. From this, we show that while the discrete AWG matches its expected resolving power, the continuous AWG spectrograph can, in principle, achieve an effective resolution significantly greater ($\\sim$ 2x) than the discrete AWG. This detailed examination of the AWGs will be foundational for future deployment of AWG spectrographs for astronomical science cases such as exoplanet atmospheres. ",

Although the faithful storage of an OAM qubit or qutrit has been realized in pioneering works, the longest storage lifetime for the former is only in the order of a few microseconds, and hundreds of nano-seconds for the latter. Here we implement a quantum memory for OAM qubits and qutrits using a cold atomic ensemble, the experimental results clearly show that our memory can still beat the classical limit after a storage time of $400\\mu s$,which is two orders of magnitude higher than the previous work.

    "title": "Manipulating Generalized Dirac Cones In Quantum Metasurfaces",
    "abstract": "We discuss the emergence and manipulation of generalised Dirac cones in the subradiant collective modes of quantum metasurfaces. We consider a collection of single quantum emitters arranged in a honeycomb lattice with subwavelength periodicity. While conventional honeycomb quantum metasurfaces host bound modes that display Dirac cones at the K and K' points, we show that introducing uniaxial anisotropy in the lattice results in modified dispersion relations. These include the tilting of Dirac cones, which changes the local density of states at the Dirac point from vanishing (type I) to diverging (types II and III), the emergence of semi-Dirac points, with linear and quadratic dispersions in orthogonal directions, and the anisotropic movement of Dirac cones away from the K and K' points. Such energy dispersions can modify substantially the dynamics of local probes, such as quantum emitters, to which they have been shown to induce anisotropic, power-law interactions ",
