    "abstract": "We have demonstrated the resonant control of the elastic scattering cross sections in the vicinity of Feshbach resonances between $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules and $^{40}$K atoms by studying the thermalization between them. The elastic scattering cross sections vary by more than two orders of magnitude close to the resonance, and can be well described by an asymmetric Fano profile. The parameters that characterize the magnetically tunable s-wave scattering length are determined from the elastic scattering cross sections. The observation of resonantly controlled elastic scattering cross sections opens up the possibility to study strongly interacting atom-molecule mixtures and improve our understanding of the complex atom-molecule Feshbach resonances.

    "abstract": "Microwave photonics (MWP) has adopted a number of important concepts and technologies over the recent pasts, including photonic integration, versatile programmability, and techniques for enhancing key radio frequency performance metrics such as the noise figure and the dynamic range. However, to date, these aspects have not been achieved simultaneously in a single circuit. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a multi-functional integrated microwave photonic circuit that enables on-chip programmable filtering functions while achieving record-high key radio frequency metrics of >120 dB.Hz dynamic range and 15 dB of noise figure that are previously unreachable. We unlock this unique feature by versatile complex spectrum tailoring using an all integrated modulation transformer and a double injection ring resonator as a multi-function optical filtering component. This work breaks the conventional and fragmented approach of integration, functionality and performance that currently prevents the adoption of integrated MWP systems in real applications. ",

    "abstract": "An ultra-narrow slot waveguide is fabricated for use in highly-efficient, electro-optic-polymer-based, integrated-optic modulators. Measurement results indicate that $V_\\pi L$'s below 1.2 V.mm are possible for balanced Mach-Zehnder modulators using this ultra-narrow slot waveguide on a silicon-organic hybrid platform. Simulated $V_\\pi L$'s of 0.35 V.mm have also been obtained. In addition to adapting standard recipes, we developed two novel fabrication processes for achieving miniaturized devices with high modulation sensitivity. To boost compactness and decrease the overall footprint, we use a fabrication approach based on air bridge interconnects on thick, thermally-reflowed, MaN 2410 E-beam resist protected by an alumina layer. To overcome the challenges of high currents and imperfect infiltration of polymers into ultra-narrow slots, we use a carefully designed, atomically-thin layer of TiO$_2$ as a carrier-barrier to enhance the polling efficiency of our electro-optic polymers. Additionally, finite-difference time-domain simulations are employed to optimize the effect of the thin layer of TiO$_2$. As compared to other, non-optimized, cases, our peak measured current is reduced by a factor of 3; scanning electron microscopy images also demonstrate that we achieve almost perfect infiltration. The anticipated increase in total capacitance due to the TiO$_2$ layer is shown to be negligible. In fact, applying our TiO$_2$ surface treatment to our ultra-narrow slot, allows us to obtain an improved phase shift efficiency ($\\partial n / \\partial V$) of $\\sim$94% for a 10 nm TiO$_2$ layer.

We compare these results to sub-Doppler forces modeled using optical Bloch equations and Monte Carlo simulations of the molecular beam trajectories.

    "abstract": "Sources of spectrally engineered photonic states are a key resource in several quantum technologies. Of particular importance are the so-called factorizable biphoton states which possess no spectral entanglement and hence, are ideal for heralded generation of high-purity single photons. An essential prerequisite for generating these states through nonlinear frequency conversion is the control over the group indices of the photonic modes of the source. Here, we show that thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) is an excellent platform for this purpose. We design and fabricate periodically poled ridge waveguides in LNOI to demonstrate group index engineering of its guided photonic modes and harness this control to experimentally realize on-chip group index matched type-II sum-frequency generation (SFG) and photon-pair creation through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Also, we numerically study the role of the top cladding layer in tuning the dispersion properties of the ridge waveguide structures and reveal a distinctive difference between the air and silica-clad designs which are currently among the two most common device cladding configurations in LNOI. We expect that these results will be relevant for various classical and quantum applications where dispersion control is crucial in tailoring the nonlinear response of the LNOI-based devices. ",

However, it is hard to apply to low repetition frequency pulsed lasers, since there exists an overlap frequency domain between pulse laser and the amplitude phase noise and traditional filters cannot effectively separate phase noise. Aiming to solve the problem in this paper, we propose a novel method of pulse noise detection, identification, and filtering based on the autocorrelation characteristics between noise signals. In the proposed algorithm, a self-designed window algorithm is used to identify the pulse, and then the pulse signal group in the window is replaced by interpolation, which effectively filter the pulse signal doped in the phase noise within 0.1 ms. After filtering the pulses in the phase noise, the phase difference of two pulsed beams (10 kHz) is successfully compensated to zero in 1 ms, and the coherent combination of closed-loop phase lock is realized. At the same time, the phase correction times are few, the phase lock effect is stable, and the final light intensity increases to the ideal value (0.9 Imax). ",

    "abstract": "Here, we report the development of a detailed \"Materials Informatics\" framework for the design of acoustic coatings for underwater sound attenuation through integrating Machine Learning (ML) and statistical optimization algorithms with a Finite Element Model (FEM). The finite element models were developed to simulate the realistic performance of the acoustic coatings based on polyurethane (PU) elastomers with embedded cylindrical voids. The FEM results revealed that the frequency-dependent viscoelastic behavior of the polyurethane matrix has a significant impact on the magnitude and frequency of the absorption peak associated with the cylinders at low frequencies, which has been commonly ignored in previous studies on similar systems. The data generated from the FEM was used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to accelerate the design process, and subsequently, was integrated with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal geometric parameters of the cylinders to achieve maximized, broadband, low-frequency waterborne sound attenuation. A significant, broadband, low-frequency attenuation is achieved by optimally configuring the layers of cylindrical voids and using attenuation mechanisms, including Fabry-P\\'erot resonance and Bragg scattering of the layers of voids. Integration of the machine learning technique into the optimization algorithm further accelerated the exploration of the high dimensional design space for the targeted performance. The developed DNN exhibited significantly increased speed (by a factor of $4.5\\times 10^3$ ) in predicting the absorption coefficient compared to the conventional FEM(s). Therefore, the acceleration brought by the materials informatics framework brings a paradigm shift to the design and development of acoustic coatings compared to the conventional trial-and-error practices.

In the system, a multiple-intensity modulated laser module is designed to produce the light pulses of quantum states, including signal state, decoy state and vacuum state. The classical communication and synchronization are realized by wireless optical transmission. Multiple filtering techniques and wavelength division multiplexing are further used to avoid crosstalk of different light. We test the performance of the system and obtain a final key rate of 245.6 bps with an average QBER of 1.91% over a 2.4m water channel, in which the channel attenuation is 16.35dB.

On the one hand, quantum algorithms may notably be used to extend the reach of electronic structure calculations. On the other hand, quantum machine learning is also emerging as an alternative and promising path to quantum advantage. Here we follow this second route and establish a direct connection between classical and quantum solutions for learning neural network potentials. To this end, we design a quantum neural network architecture and apply it successfully to different molecules of growing complexity. The quantum models exhibit larger effective dimension with respect to classical counterparts and can reach competitive performances, thus pointing towards potential quantum advantages in natural science applications via quantum machine learning.
