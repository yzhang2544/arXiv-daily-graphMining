    "abstract": "High-fidelity modeling of plasma-based acceleration (PBA) requires the use of 3D fully nonlinear and kinetic descriptions based on the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. Three-dimensional PIC algorithms based on the quasi-static approximation (QSA) have been successfully applied to efficiently model the beam-plasma interaction. In a QSA-PIC algorithm, the plasma response to a charged particle beam or laser driver is calculated based on self-consistent forces from the QSA form of Maxwell's equations. These fields are then used to advance the charged particle beam or laser forward by a large time step. Since the time step is not limited by the regular Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition that constrains a standard 3D fully electromagnetic PIC code, a 3D QSA-PIC code can achieve orders of magnitude speedup in performance. Recently, a new hybrid QSA-PIC algorithm that combines another speedup technique known as azimuthal Fourier decomposition has been proposed and implemented. This hybrid algorithm decomposes the electromagnetic fields, charge and current density into azimuthal harmonics and only the Fourier coefficients need to be updated, which can significantly reduce the algorithmic complexity. Modeling the laser-plasma interaction in a full 3D PIC algorithm is very computationally expensive due to the enormous disparity of physical scales to be resolved. In the QSA the laser is modeled using the ponderomotive guiding center (PGC) approach. We describe how to implement a PGC algorithm compatible with the QSA PIC algorithms based on the azimuthal mode expansion. This algorithm permits time steps orders of magnitude larger than the cell size and it can be asynchronously parallelized. Details on how this is implemented into the QSA PIC code that utilizes an azimuthal mode expansion, QPAD, are also described. ",

    "abstract": "Thin film 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) is emerging as a contender for realizing large-scale optical quantum circuits due to its high CMOS technology compatibility and large optical nonlinearities. Though, challenges remain in producing wafer-scale 4H-SiC thin film on insulator (4H-SiCOI) for dense integration of photonic circuits, and in efficient coupling of deterministic quantum emitters that are essential for scalable quantum photonics. Here we demonstrate hybrid integration of self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) based single-photon sources (SPSs) with wafer-scale 4H-SiC photonic chips prepared by ion slicing technique. By designing a bilayer vertical coupler, we realize generation and highly efficient routing of single-photon emission in the hybrid quantum photonic chip. Furthermore, we realize a chip-integrated beamsplitter operation for triggered single photons through fabricating a 1x2 multi-mode interferometer (MMI) with a symmetric power splitting ratio of 50:50. The successful demonstration of heterogeneously integrating QDs-based SPSs on 4H-SiC photonic chip prepared by ion slicing technique constitutes an important step toward CMOS-compatible, fast reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits with deterministic SPSs.

The temporal evolution of multi-charged ions, background neutrals and ions is systematically studied for varying laser intensities. The temporal evolution shows all the species have dual peak structure for all the laser energies considered in the study. The fast peak is sharp whereas the slow peak is broad similar to that observed in previous studies. Moreover, higher charged ions have higher velocity, indicating acceleration from the transient electric field produced at the very initial temporal stages of expansion. Interestingly, the fast peak gets delayed, whereas the slow peak advances in time with increased laser intensity, which has not been reported in earlier studies. The observations point towards the possible role of ambipolar electric fields in the unexpected observed behavior of the TOF profiles. ",

The strength of the applied external magnetic field is chosen as a parameter to ensure that the laser frequency lies in the appropriate pass band.

From these results, the cooling process, which would proceed by transitions between a\\sup{3}{\\Pi}\\sup{+}\\sub{0} and X\\sup{1}{\\Sigma}\\sup{+}\\sub{0} states, had as potential bottleneck the long lifetime (6.04 {\\mu}s) of the excited state a\\sup{3}{\\Pi}\\sup{+}\\sub{0} , that would prohibit experimentally control the slowing region. Here, we revisit this system by employing four-component Multireference Configuration Interaction (MRCI) calculations, and investigate the effect of such approaches on the calculated transition moments between a\\sup{3}{\\Pi}\\sup{+}\\sub{0} and a\\sup{3}{\\Pi}\\sub{1} excited states of TlCl as well as TlF, the latter serving as a benchmark between theory and experiment. Wherever possible, MRCI results have been cross-validated by, and turned out to be consistent with, four-component equation of motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) and polarization propagator (PP) calculations. We find that the results of TlF are very closed to experiment values, while for TlCl the lifetime of the a3{\\Pi}+0 state is now estimated to be 175 ns, which is much shorter than previous calculations indicated, thus yielding a different, more favorable cooling dynamics. By solving the rate-equation numerically, we provide evidence that TlCl could have cooling properties similar to those of TlF. Our investigations also point to the potential benefits of enhancing the stimulated radiation in optical cycle to improve cooling efficiency. ",

While T1 or T2 contrast MRI are relatively insensitive to temperature, techniques with greater temperature sensitivity such as chemical shift or diffusion imaging suffer from motional artifacts and long scan times. We describe an approach for highly sensitive and high throughput MR thermometry that is not susceptible to motional artifacts. We use superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to spoil T2 of water protons. Motional narrowing results in proportionality between T2 and the diffusion constant, dependent only on the temperature in a specific environment. Our results show, for pure water, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) linewidth and T2 follow the same temperature dependence as the self-diffusion constant of water. Thus, a T2 mapping is a diffusion mapping in the presence of SPIONs, and T2 is a thermometer. For pure water, a T2 mapping of a 32 x 32 image (voxel size = 1 mm x 1 mm x 3 mm) in a 9.4 T MRI scanner resulted in a temperature resolution of 0.5 K for a scan time of 2 minutes. This indicates a highly sensitive and high throughput MR thermometry technique potentially useful for monitoring of biological tissues during thermal therapies or for diagnosis. ",

    "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) can be quite advantageous in advancing the field of catalysis because of the microscopic insights it provides, and thus can guide experimental searches of novel catalysts. Several recent works have demonstrated that low-dimensional materials can be very efficient catalysts. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have gained much attention in past years due to their unique properties like low toxicity, chemical inertness, biocompatibility, crystallinity, etc. These properties of GQDs which are due to quantum confinement and edge effects facilitate their applications in various fields like sensing, photoelectronics, catalysis, and many more. Furthermore, the properties of GQDs can be enhanced by doping and functionalization. In order to understand the effects of functionalization by oxygen and boron based groups on the catalytic properties relevant to the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), we perform a systematic study of GQDs functionalized with the oxygen (O), borinic acid (BC$_2$O), and boronic acid (BCO$_2$ ). All calculations that included geometry optimization, electronic and adsorption mechanism, were carried out using the Gaussian16 package, employing the hybrid functional B3LYP, and the basis set 6-31G(d,p). With the variation in functionalization groups in GQDs, we observe significant changes in their electronic properties. The adsorption energy E$_{ads}$ of hydrogen over O-GQD, BC$_2$O-GQD, and BCO$_2$-GQD is -0.059 eV, -0.031 eV and -0.032 eV respectively. Accordingly, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G$) of hydrogen adsorption is extraordinarily near the ideal value (0 eV) for all the three types of functionalized GQDs. Thus, the present work suggests pathways for experimental realization of low-cost and multifunctional GQDs based catalysts for clean and renewable hydrogen energy production. ",

We therefore refer to this scheme as the Inverse Reynolds Dominance (IReD) approach. The remaining (non-vanishing) transport coefficients can be obtained exclusively in terms of the inverse of the collision matrix. This procedure fixes unambiguously the relaxation times of the dissipative quantities, which are no longer related to the eigenvalues of the inverse of the collision matrix. In particular, we find that the relaxation times corresponding to higher order moments grow as their order increases, thereby contradicting the \\textit{separation of scales} paradigm. The formal (up to second order) equivalence with the standard DNMR approach is proven and the connection between the IReD transport coefficients and the usual DNMR ones is established. ",
