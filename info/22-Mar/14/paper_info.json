    "abstract": "We report on the properties of a non-conventional stochastic photonic source. We first describe the principle of nonlinear intensity filtering by using a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The latter alters the characteristics of an input stochastic source based on Bose-Einstein emission. Computed output intensity fluctuations are compared to an analytical model. Adjusting the interferometer parameters, we show theoretically and numerically that the statistical properties of light such as its probability density function can be tailored. Depending on the parameters, the probability density may exhibit large overshoots or smoother fluctuations. We further evaluate the impact of these modified statistics on simple nonlinear processes. Compared to Bose-Einstein emitters, the yield of nonlinear phenomena varies by several orders of magnitude. We finally simulate the nonlinear interaction of such a laser source with a dielectric material (fused silica) within the framework of a more realistic model, including a statistical analysis. It confirms that the deposited energy varies over many decades and can be largely enhanced due to the properties of the presented laser source. ",

    "abstract": "The polarization state of light is a key parameter in many imaging systems. For example, it can image mechanical stress and other physical properties that are not seen with conventional imaging, and can also play a central role in quantum sensing. However, polarization is more difficult to image and polarimetry typically involves several independent measurements with moving parts in the measurement device. Metasurfaces with interleaved designs have demonstrated sensitivity to either linear or circular/elliptical polarization states. Here we present an all-dielectric meta-polarimeter for direct measurement of any arbitrary polarization states from a single unit-cell design. By engineering a completely asymmetric design, we obtained a metasurface that can excite eigenmodes of the nanoresonators, thus displaying a unique diffraction pattern for not only any linear polarization state but all elliptical polarization states (and handedness) as well. The unique diffraction patterns are quantified into Stokes parameters with a resolution of 5$^{\\circ}$ and with a polarization state fidelity of up to $99\\pm1$%. This holds promise for applications in polarization imaging and quantum state tomography. ",

Here, we develop a Maxwell Hamiltonian theory of matter combined with the quantum theory of atomistic polarization to obtain the electrodynamic dispersion of natural materials interacting with the photon field. We apply this theory to silicon and discover the existence of anomalous atomistic waves. These waves occur in the spectral region where propagating waves are conventionally forbidden in a macroscopic theory.

    "abstract": "We investigate the high-order harmonic generations (HHGs) of graphene irradiated by linearly polarized lasers with intensities in a wide range from $10^{8}$ W/cm$^2$ to $10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$. We find a striking knee structure in the laser intensity dependence of HHGs, which consists of a linear growth regime, followed by a plateau of the saturated HHGs, and then a transition to a nonlinear growth. The knee structure is rather universal for the varied harmonic orders and has been certificated by the calculations of two-band density-matrix equations as well as the \\textit{ab initio} calculations of time-dependent density functional theory. Based on the two-band model, we reveal the underlying mechanisms: The behavior of linear growth can be depicted analytically by the perturbative theory of optical conductivity; While, the plateau of saturated HHGs and the transition to a nonlinear growth are caused by the quantum destructive interference and constructive interference of harmonics generated by the electrons corresponding to the lattice momentums around Dirac points and M points in Brillouin zone, respectively. In particular, we find that tuning Fermi energy can effectively alter the knee structure while the profile of the knee structure is not sensitive to the temperature. Our calculations of the third-order harmonic vs. tuning Fermi energy are compared with recent experiment showing a good agreement. Our predicted knee structure and its associated properties are observable with the current experimental techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Integrated optomechanical cavities stand as a promising means to interface mechanical motion and guided optical modes. State-of-the-art demonstrations rely on optical and mechanical modes tightly confined of in micron-scale areas to achieve strong optomechanical coupling. However, the need for tight optomechanical confinement and the general use of suspended devices hinders interaction with external devices, limiting the potential for the implementation of complex circuits. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new approach for optomechanical cavities coupling free-propagating surface acoustic waves (SAWs) and guided optical modes. The cavity is formed by a periodic array of silicon nanopillars with subwavelength separation, implemented in silicon-on-insulator substrate. Optical pumping yields a strong radiation pressure that drives the harmonic vibration of the pillars, periodically deforming the silica under-cladding and exciting the SAW. The propagation of the SAW deforms the cavity period, modulating the resonance wavelength to close the optomechanical coupling loop. Based on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate a phonon laser at room temperature and ambient conditions with optical pump power as low as 1 mW. We also show the possibility to cascade this process, achieving a frequency comb generation with more than 30 harmonic lines. These results open a new path to achieve strong bidirectional coupling between integrated waveguides and SAW, with a great potential for a wide range of applications in quantum and classical domains.

Here, by combining Dirac semimetals with Bragg reflector constructed by one-dimensional photonic crystal, we theoretically design a simple multilayer structure to enhance and manipulate the PSHE. Through the detailed and optimal design of the conductivity characteristics of Dirac semimetals and the structural parameters of the whole model, we realize the excitation of Optical Tamm states (OTSs) in the multilayer structure, so that the PSHE can be enhanced and controllable. The theoretical results show that by optimizing the Fermi energy and the thickness of Dirac semimetal, the reflection coefficient ratio can be increased under p-polarization and s-polarization, thus creating conditions for enhanced PSHE. In addition, the effects of the incident angle and the parameters of the spacer layer on the PSHE are also clarified. We believe above results can provide a new paradigm for the construction of controllable spin devices. ",

    "abstract": "Next-generation dark matter (DM) detectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) will be sensitive to coherent scattering from solar neutrinos, demanding an efficient background-signal discrimination tool. Directional detectors improve sensitivity to WIMP DM despite the irreducible neutrino background. Wide-bandgap semiconductors offer a path to directional detection in a high-density target material. A detector of this type operates in a hybrid mode. The WIMP or neutrino-induced nuclear recoil is detected using real-time charge, phonon, or photon collection. The directional signal, however, is imprinted as a durable sub-micron damage track in the lattice structure. This directional signal can be read out by a variety of atomic physics techniques, from point defect quantum sensing to x-ray microscopy. In this white paper, we present the detector principle and review the status of the experimental techniques required for directional readout of nuclear recoil tracks. Specifically, we focus on diamond as a target material; it is both a leading platform for emerging quantum technologies and a promising component of next-generation semiconductor electronics. Based on the development and demonstration of directional readout in diamond over the next decade, a future WIMP detector will leverage or motivate advances in multiple disciplines towards precision dark matter and neutrino physics.
