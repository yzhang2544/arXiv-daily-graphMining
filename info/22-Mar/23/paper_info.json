    "abstract": "We present a subHz linewidth portable ultrastable laser with the mass and volume of are 40kg and 400mm*280mm*450mm, respectively, that meets the requirements of automatic frequency locking and road transportation. A dynamic analytical model of the physical parts of ultrastable laser is established, and the first order resonance frequency is determined by FEA and well agrees with the experimentally measured result. To verify the transport performance of the portable ultrastable laser, it is tested for 100 km actual road transportation and 60 min continuous vibration, corresponding to 1700 km road transportation. The success of the test demonstrated that the portable ultrastable laser was very robust. Meanwhile, the portable ultrastable lasers shows that the median of the linewidth distribution is approximately 0.78 Hz, and the fractional frequency instability is less than 3E-15 at 1 to 10 s averaging time. This value approaches the total noise of 2.0E-15 including thermal noise and residual amplitude modulation. The robust suggested that the portable ultrastable laser might be a good candidate such as optical frequency transfer and metrological systems. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To describe the current properties and capabilities of an open-source hardware and software package that is being developed by many sites internationally with the aim of providing an inexpensive yet flexible platform for low-cost MRI. Methods: This paper describes three different setups from 50 to 360 mT in different settings, all of which used the MaRCoS console for acquiring data, and different types of software interfaces (custom-built GUI or PulSeq overlay) to acquire the data. Results: Images are presented from both phantoms and in vivo from healthy volunteers to demonstrate the image quality that can be obtained from the MaRCoS hardware/software interfaced to different low-field magnets. Conclusions: The results presented here show that a number of different sequences commonly used in the clinic can be programmed into an open-source system relatively quickly and easily, and can produce good quality images even at this early stage of development. Both the hardware and software will continue to develop, and it is an aim of this paper to encourage other groups to join this international consortium. ",

    "abstract": "Coherent structures are ubiquitously observed in nature, experiments and numerical simulations, however they lack a rigorous unique mathematical definition until this date. While the amount of literature in this field is steadily growing without a tendency of developing a definition which is rigorously agreed upon, the general influence onto the essential structure formation process, namely the inverse energy cascade mechanism, is usually not discussed. Therefore, the present study conducts a comparison between several structure detection schemes comprised of the vorticity magnitude, Okubo-Weiss criterion, and Lagrangian coherent structures, with regard to the inverse cascade in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. For that, the recently introduced vortex scaling theory determines the threshold choices of these methods. We observe that all methods exhibit qualitatively similar properties with respect to the cascade behavior. Furthermore, coherent structures have a smaller contribution to the inverse energy cascade, as compared to their residual counterparts. This has two reasons: $(i)$ There is a higher misalignment tendency of strain-rate and subgrid stress tensors within coherent regions, leading to a decreased energy cascade efficiency. $(ii)$ Coherent structures exhibit shape preserving properties and are less affected by the vortex thinning mechanism.

    "abstract": "Polarization transfers are crucial building blocks in magnetic resonance experiments, i.e., they can be used to polarize insensitive nuclei and correlate nuclear spins in multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The polarization can be transferred either across different nuclear spin species or from electron spins to the relatively low-polarized nuclear spins. The former route occurring in solid-state NMR (ssNMR) can be performed via cross polarization (CP), while the latter route is known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Despite having different operating conditions, we opinionate that both mechanisms are theoretically similar processes in ideal conditions, i.e., the electron is merely another spin-1/2 particle with a much higher gyromagnetic ratio. Here, we show that the CP and DNP processes can be described using a unified theory based on average Hamiltonian theory (AHT) combined with fictitious operators. The intuitive and unified approach has allowed new insights on the cross effect (CE) DNP mechanism, leading to better design of DNP polarizing agents and extending the applications beyond just hyperpolarization. We explore the possibility of exploiting theoretically predicted DNP transients for electron-nucleus distance measurements--like routine dipolar-recoupling experiments in solid-state NMR. ",

    "abstract": "In a lossless periodic structure, a bound state in the continuum (BIC) is characterized by a real frequency and a real Bloch wavevector for which there exist waves propagating to or from infinity in the surrounding media. For applications, it is important to analyze the high-$Q$ resonances that either exist naturally for wavevectors near that of the BIC or appear when the structure is perturbed. Existing theories provide quantitative results for the complex frequency (and the $Q$-factor) of resonant modes that appear/exist due to structural perturbations or wavevector variations. When a periodic structure is regarded as a periodic waveguide, eigenmodes are often analyzed for a given real frequency. In this paper, we consider periodic waveguides with a BIC, and study the eigenmodes for given real frequencies near the frequency of the BIC. It turns out that such eigenmodes near the BIC always have a complex Bloch wavenumber, but they may or may not be leaky modes that radiate out power laterally to infinity. These eigenmodes can also be complex modes that decay exponentially in the lateral direction. Our study is relevant for applications of BICs in optical waveguides, and it is also helpful for analyzing photonic devices operating near the frequency of a BIC. ",

Previous works suggest that such turbulence could be described as an ensemble of interacting inertial waves across a wide range of length scales. For turbulence in macroscopic quantum condensates, the nature of the transition between the quasiclassical dynamics at large scales and the corresponding dynamics at small scales, where the quantization of vorticity is essential, remains an outstanding unresolved question. Here we expand the paradigm of wave-driven turbulence to rotating quantum fluids where the spectrum of waves extends to microscopic scales as Kelvin waves on quantized vortices. We excite inertial waves at the largest scale by periodic modulation of the angular velocity and observe dissipation-independent transfer of energy to smaller scales and the eventual onset of the elusive Kelvin-wave cascade at the lowest temperatures. We further find that energy is pumped to the system through a boundary layer distinct from the classical Ekman layer and support our observations with numerical simulations. Our experiments demonstrate a new regime of turbulent motion in quantum fluids where the role of vortex reconnections can be neglected, thus stripping the transition between the classical and the quantum regimes of turbulence down to its bare bones.

We also discovered in the meantime that, in our first book of 1978, we had already used a new way for studying the various compatibility conditions (CC) of an operator that may not be necessarily formally integrable (FI) in order to construct canonical formally exact differential sequences on the jet level. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the combination of these two facts clearly shows the specific importance of the Spencer operator and the Spencer $\\delta$-cohomology, totally absent from mathematical physics today. The results obtained are unavoidable because they only depend on elementary combinatorics and diagram chasing. They also provide for the first time the purely intrinsic interpretation of the respective numbers of successive first, second, third and higher order generating CC. However, if they of course agree with the linearized Killing operator over the Minkowski metric, they largely disagree with recent publications on the respective numbers of generating CC for the linearized Killing operator over the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics. Many similar examples are illustrating these new techniques, providing in particular the only symbol existing in the literature which is 2-ayclic witout being of finite type, contrary to the conformal situation.

To address this challenge, we demonstrate hybrid training of optical neural networks where the weight matrix is trained with neuron activation functions computed optically via forward propagation through the network. We examine the efficacy of hybrid training with three different networks: an optical linear classifier, a hybrid opto-electronic network, and a complex-valued optical network. We perform a comparative study to in silico training, and our results show that hybrid training is robust against different kinds of static noise. Our platform-agnostic hybrid training scheme can be applied to a wide variety of optical neural networks, and this work paves the way towards advanced all-optical training in machine intelligence. ",

Synthetic frequency dimensions, in particular, have been used to experimentally realize a plethora of bulk physics effects, such as effective gauge potentials, nontrivial Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian topology, spin-momentum locking, complex long-range coupling, unidirectional frequency conversion, and four-dimensional lattices. However, in synthetic frequency dimensions there has not been any demonstration of boundary effects which are of paramount importance in topological physics due to the bulk edge correspondence, since systems exhibiting synthetic frequency dimensions do not support well-defined sharp boundaries. Here we theoretically elucidate a method to construct boundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension of dynamically modulated ring resonators by strongly coupling it to an auxiliary ring, and provide an experimental demonstration of this method. We experimentally explore various physics effects associated with the creation of such boundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension, including confinement of the spectrum of light, the discretization of the band structure, and the interaction of such boundaries with the topologically protected one-way chiral modes in a quantum Hall ladder. The incorporation of boundaries allows us to observe topologically robust transport of light along the frequency axis, which shows that the frequency of light can be controlled through topological concepts. Our demonstration of such sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of exploring topological physics, and is also of importance for other applications such as classical and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency dimensions.

However, evaluating the impact of a noisy environment on the QZZB without applying certain approximations proposed by Tsang [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 230401 (2012)] remains a difficult challenge. In this paper, we not only derive the general form of the QZZB with the photon loss and the phase diffusion by invoking the technique of integration within an ordered product of operators, but also show its estimation performance for several different Gaussian resources, such as a coherent state (CS), a single-mode squeezed vacuum state (SMSVS) and a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVS). Our results indicate that compared with the SMSVS and the TMSVS, the QZZB for the CS always shows the better estimation performance under the photon-loss environment. More interestingly, for the phase-diffusion environment, the estimation performance of the QZZB for the TMSVS can be better than that for the CS throughout a wide range of phase-diffusion strength. Our findings will provide a useful guidance for investigating the noisy quantum parameter estimation. ",

    "abstract": "We model propagation of far-red-detuned optical vortex beams through a Bose-Einstein Condensate using nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We show the formation of coupled light/atomic solitons that rotate azimuthally before moving off tangentially, carrying angular momentum. The number, and velocity, of solitons, depends on the orbital angular momentum of the optical field. Using a Bessel-Gauss beam increases radial confinement so that solitons can rotate with fixed azimuthal velocity. Our model provides a highly controllable method of channelling a BEC and atomic transport. ",

    "title": "Temporal trapping of ultrashort pulses enables deterministic optical  quantum computation",
    "abstract": "The realization of deterministic photon-photon gates is a central goal in optical quantum computation and engineering. While solid-state nonlinear optics offers a scalable, room temperature solution, weak material nonlinearities lead to extremely demanding requirements on optical loss and confinement, which to date have not been realized. In this work, we introduce a novel confinement method, dispersion-engineered temporal trapping, which enhances the nonlinear interaction strength by orders of magnitude by simultaneously confining photons in both time and space. Temporal confinement is imposed by a non-resonant \"trap\" pulse via cross-phase modulation, realizing a wavelength-scale \"flying cavity\". Numerical simulations confirm that temporal trapping confines the multimode nonlinear dynamics to a single-mode subspace, enabling high-fidelity deterministic quantum gate operations. With realistic dispersion engineering and loss figures, we show that temporally trapped ultrashort pulses could achieve strong coupling on near-term nonlinear nanophotonic platforms. Our scheme is compatible with traveling-wave implementations and intracavity time multiplexing, which can further enhance the operation bandwidth and scalability. We expect temporal trapping to open a new path to optical strong coupling, with applications in quantum computing, simulation, and light sources. ",
