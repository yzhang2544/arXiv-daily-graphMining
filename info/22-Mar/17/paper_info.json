The proposed collider offers cost and AC power savings, smaller footprint (relative to the ILC), and could be built at Fermilab with an Interaction Region within the site boundaries. After the initial physics run at 250 GeV, the collider could be upgraded either to higher luminosity or to higher (up to 500 GeV) energies. If the ILC could not be realized in Japan in a timely fashion, the HELEN collider would be a viable option to build a Higgs factory in the U.S. ",

The half-space Green's function, which has been used previously in scattering and diffraction, adds terms to the usual expressions of the integral operators without altering their continuity properties. Verifications against the Pekeris waveguide suggest that the model allows an adequately prediction for the acoustic field. Likewise, numerical explorations in relation to the necessary mesh size for the description of the water-sediment interface allow us to conclude that a TL prediction with acceptable accuracy can be obtained with the use of a bounded mesh around the desired evaluation region.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology is a growing and multi-disciplinary research field, particularly for sensing and telecommunications. A number of THz waveguides have emerged over the past years, which are set to complement the capabilities of existing and bulky free space setups. In most designs however, the guiding region is physically separated from the surroundings, making interactions between light and the environment inefficient. We present photonic THz light cages (THzLCs) operating at THz frequencies, consisting of free-standing dielectric strands, which guide light within a hollow core with immediate access to the environment. We show the versatility and design flexibility of this concept, by 3D-printing several cm-length-scale modules using a single design and four different polymer- and ceramic- materials, which are either rigid, flexible, or resistant to high temperatures. We characterize propagation- and bend-losses for straight- and curved- waveguides, which are of order ~1 dB/cm in the former, and ~2-8 dB/cm in the latter for bend radii below 10 cm, and largely independent of the material. Our transmission experiments are complemented by near-field measurements at the waveguide output, which reveal antiresonant guidance for straight THzLCs, and a deformed fundamental mode in the bent waveguides, in agreement with numerical conformal mapping simulations. We show that these THzLCs can be used either as: (i) flexible, reconfigurable, and bendable modular assemblies; (ii) in-core sensors of structures contained directly inside the hollow core; (iii) high-temperature sensors, with potential applications in industrial monitoring. These THzLCs are a novel and useful addition to the growing library of THz waveguides, marrying the waveguide-like advantages of reconfigurable, diffractionless propagation, with the free-space-like immediacy of direct exposure to the surrounding environment.

    "abstract": "The conventional ion temperature gradient or \\eta_i mode is known to propagate in the ion diamagnetic direction. Investigation of a generic drift fluid model with warm ions and adiabatic electrons, reveals that as \\eta_i decreases, the propagation characteristics of the unstable mode may change drastically, the mode frequency first decreases in magnitude, and reaches zero for a critical \\eta_i. But as \\eta_i goes down further, the mode begins to propagate in the electron diamagnetic direction. The lower toroidal mode number perturbations are more prone to reversal in propagation direction. Even for \\eta_i=0, the mode remains unstable, drawing free energy form the density gradients. Since finite ion temperature appears to be essential for propagation in the electron direction, it is appropriate to introduce new terminology and call this wave the warm ion electron drift (WIED) mode. The model drift wave system is explored within the framework of the two dimensional (2D) weakly asymmetric ballooning theory (WABT) for local eigenmode satisfying natural boundary conditions. The physics behind the excitation of the eigenmode crossing zero frequency is identified to be the reactive instability induced by the curvature coupling between the positive energy wave and the negative energy wave, a damped mode in electron direction coupled to a growing mode in the ion direction in non-dissipative slab limit. Apart from its intrinsic scientific value, this mechanism may shed some light onto the nature of tokamak edge turbulence observed in frequencies moderately lower than the electron diamagnetic frequency; understanding this phenomenon could be helpful in conceptual design around the edge region of future tokamak.

Here, a general approach to resolving this challenge is provided. By deriving the critical coupling condition of a multimode nonlinear optics system in a generalized theoretical framework, two efficiency limitations of the conventional pump method of DKS are revealed: the effective coupling rate is too small and is also power-dependent. Nonlinear couplers are proposed to sustain the DKS indirectly through nonlinear energy conversion processes, realizing a power-adaptive effective coupling rate to the DKS and matching the total dissipation rate of the system, which promises near-unity power conversion efficiencies. For instance, a conversion efficiency exceeding $90\\:\\%$ is predicted for aluminum nitride microrings with a nonlinear coupler utilizing second-harmonic generation. The nonlinear coupler approach for high-efficiency generation of DKS is experimentally feasible as its mechanism applies to various nonlinear processes, including Raman and Brillouin scattering, and thus paves the way of micro-solitons towards practical applications.

The relative timing jitter between these two pulse trains is 2.2 fs [20 Hz, 100 kHz]. In addition to its high passive stability that suppresses fast timing fluctuations, this new technique also enables slow feedback on the repetition rate difference to avoid drifts.

This is different from a frequent approach, where completely degeneracy is assumed in dense plasmas. The general reasoning in the reviewed works is to take a numerical coefficient in from of the Bohm potential term in quantum fluids, in order to fit the linear waves from quantum kinetic theory in the long wavelength limit. Moreover, the equation of state for the ideal Fermi gas is assumed, for arbitrary degeneracy degree. The quantum fluid equations allow the expedite derivation of weakly nonlinear equations from reductive perturbation theory. In this way, quantum Korteweg - de Vries and quantum Zakharov - Kuznetsov equations are derived, together with the conditions for bright and dark soliton propagation. Quantum ion-acoustic waves in unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas, together with magnetosonic waves, have been obtained for arbitrary degeneracy degree. The conditions for the application of the models, and the physical situations where the mixed dense - dilute systems exist, have been identified. ",

We do this by expanding the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (equivalently, the Gross-Pitaevskii equation) in the basis of Wannier states, showing that the soliton's position is dictated by that of the Wannier state throughout the pump cycle.

In this work, the decoherence phenomena are addressed from the perspective of the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) framework in which the noise is in part seen as internal to the system. The framework is as well used to describe changes in the energy associated with environmental interactions. Three scenarios, an inversion recovery experiment, a Ramsey experiment, and a two-qubit entanglement-disentanglement experiment are used to demonstrate the applicability of this framework, which provides good results relative to the experiments and the Lindblad equation, It does so, however, from a different perspective as to the cause of the decoherence.
