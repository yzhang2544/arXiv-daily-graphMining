    "title": "\"Keep the fight unfair\": Military rhetoric in quantum technology",
    "abstract": "Doing quantum ethics properly will require detailed socio-political analysis of the technologies and the organizations trying to build them. In this paper, I contribute to this task by analysing the public rhetoric of American military stakeholders in the quantum industry. I look at Air Force Research Laboratory involvement in the 2020 Quantum 2 Business conference, where they were the main sponsor. A critical thematic analysis shows a focus on enacting the violence of war, maintaining narratives that the Air Force provides a secure future for Americans, and marrying quantum technology with the aesthetics of war. I contextualize this with anti-imperialist theory, arguing that this rhetoric and the desire for quantum arms aligns with the reproduction of existing violent power structures. Insights about this example of military involvement in quantum spaces should help orient nascent critical quantum ethics interventions. ",

    "abstract": "We present an electro-optic modulator exploiting an array of Vanadium dioxide nanorods operating in the epsilon near regime as the active switching material integrated in a silicon waveguide. The modulator takes advantage of the insulator-to-metal transition of Vanadium dioxide to achieve a robust modulation depth of 19.7 dB/micron with a broad wavelength of operation. Using simulations, we demonstrate how the effective permittivity of the metamaterial can be tuned to a near-zero value by varying the nanorod geometry. The paper also proposes a novel hexagonal array design which achieves low insertion losses while retaining a strong modulation depth. The results provide insight into the design of ultra-compact modulators with high operation frequencies and low insertion losses. ",

    "abstract": "A backside-illuminated (BSI) near-infrared enhanced silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) for time-of-flight (ToF) light detection and ranging applications is presented. The detector contains a 2 $\\mu$m wide multiplication region with a spherically-uniform electric field peak enforced by field-line crowding. A charge-focusing electric field extends into a 10 $\\mu$m deep absorption volume, whereby electrons generated in all corners of the device can move efficiently towards the multiplication region. The SPAD is integrated with a customized 130 nm CMOS technology and a dedicated BSI process. The device has a pitch of 15 $\\mu$m, which has the potential to be scaled down without significant performance loss. Furthermore, the detector achieves a photon detection efficiency of 27% at 905 nm, with an excess bias of 3.5 V that is controlled by integrated CMOS electronics, and a timing resolution of 240 ps. By virtue of these features, the device architecture is well-suited for large format ToF imaging arrays with integrated electronics. ",

    "abstract": "Phase retrieval in optical imaging refers to the recovery of a complex signal from phaseless data acquired in the form of its diffraction patterns. These patterns are acquired through a system with a coherent light source that employs a diffractive optical element (DOE) to modulate the scene resulting in coded diffraction patterns at the sensor. Recently, the hybrid approach of model-driven network or deep unfolding has emerged as an effective alternative because it allows for bounding the complexity of phase retrieval algorithms while also retaining their efficacy. Additionally, such hybrid approaches have shown promise in improving the design of DOEs that follow theoretical uniqueness conditions. There are opportunities to exploit novel experimental setups and resolve even more complex DOE phase retrieval applications. This paper presents an overview of algorithms and applications of deep unfolding for bootstrapped - regardless of near, middle, and far zones - phase retrieval. ",

We use density matrix simulations to explain the time scales that shape the transient atomic response under different laser conditions, finding them to be limited by dephasing mechanisms including transit time broadening, Rydberg-Rydberg collisions, and ionization.

These purpose-built analog devices implement vector multiplications with the physics of resonator devices, offering efficiency, latency, and throughput advantages over equivalent electronic circuits. Along with these advantages, however, often comes the difficult challenges of compensation for fabrication variations and environmental disturbances. In this paper we review sources of variation and disturbances from our experiments, as well as mathematically define quantities that model them. Then, we introduce how the physics of resonators can be exploited to weight and sum multiwavelength signals. Finally, we outline automated design and control methodologies necessary to create practical, manufacturable, and high accuracy/precision resonator weight banks that can withstand operating conditions in the field. This represents a road map for unlocking the potential of resonator weight banks in practical deployment scenarios. ",

Machine learning provides a new tool to maximize the information provided by these detectors. The information is sparse, which forces these algorithms to start from the lowest level data and exploit all symmetries in the detector to produce results. In this work we present KamNet which harnesses breakthroughs in geometric deep learning and spatiotemporal data analysis to maximize the physics reach of KamLAND-Zen, a kiloton scale spherical liquid scintillator detector searching for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$). Using a simplified background model for KamLAND we show that KamNet outperforms a conventional CNN on benchmarking MC simulations with an increasing level of robustness. Using simulated data, we then demonstrate KamNet's ability to increase KamLAND-Zen's sensitivity to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ to excited states. A key component of this work is the addition of an attention mechanism to elucidate the underlying physics KamNet is using for the background rejection. ",

We propose a nonlinear \"measurement energy\" based upon the measurement outcomes and an iterative effective-Hamiltonian approach to extract the most probable states (maximum likelihood estimates) in an efficient and general fashion, thus reconciling the non-commuting observables and getting more out of the quantum measurements. We showcase the versatility and accuracy of our perspective on random long-range fermion models and Kitaev quantum spin liquid models, where smoking-gun signatures were lacking.

    "abstract": "When a broadband signal propagates through a dispersive medium, some frequency components move faster than the center of the pulse. This leads to the appearance of precursors, rapidly oscillating waves that emerge from the medium earlier than the main signal and seem to propagate superluminally. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of precursors in a minimal setup: an array of qubits coupled to a waveguide. The linear transmission function only converges to that of a continuous medium for large qubit numbers. Nevertheless, oscillations in the transmitted field persist even for only two qubits, which is the minimum number required for the emergence of precursors. Precursors are best observed under conditions of electromagnetically-induced transparency, as the center of the pulse is significantly delayed. Under these conditions, just a single qutrit is enough to generate a precursor. Our results pave the way towards dispersion engineering of light with just a few qubits, and can be realized with superconducting qubits coupled to transmission lines or atoms coupled to optical waveguides.

Supply chains for quantum technologies are emerging, some focussed on commercially available components for enabling technologies and/or quantum-technologies research infrastructures, others with already higher technology-readiness levels, near to the market. In 2018, the European Commission has launched its large-scale and long-term Quantum Flagship research initiative to support and foster the creation and development of a competitive European quantum technologies industry, as well as the consolidation and expansion of leadership and excellence in European quantum technology research. One of the measures to achieve an accelerated development and uptake has been identified by the Quantum Flagship in its Strategic Research Agenda: the promotion of coordinated, dedicated standardisation and certification efforts. Standardisation is indeed of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products, innovation, and competition, all leading to structuring and hence growth of markets. As quantum technologies are maturing, time has come to start thinking about further standardisation needs. This article presents insights on standardisation for quantum technologies from the perspective of the CEN-CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT), which was established in June 2020 to coordinate and support the development of standards relevant for European industry and research.

Recently, it has been generalized with the biorthogonal basis for the non-Hermitian quantum systems. From the general perturbation description with the constrain of parity-time (PT) symmetry, we show that the fidelity susceptibility is always real for the PT-symmetric states. For the PT-broken states, the real part of the fidelity is corresponding to considering both the PT partner states. Moreover, at the second-order exceptional point (EP), we prove that the real part of the fidelity between PT-symmetric and PT-broken states is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Based on these general properties, we study the two-legged non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the non-Hermitian XXZ spin chain. We find that for both interacting and non-interacting systems, the real part of fidelity susceptibility density goes to negative infinity when the parameter approaches to the EP, and verifying it is a second-order EP by the $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the real part of fidelity.
