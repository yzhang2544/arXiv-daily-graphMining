    "title": "Nonreciprocal vortex isolator by stimulated Brillouin scattering in  chiral photonic crystal fibre",
    "abstract": "Optical non-reciprocity, which breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagating optical waves, has become vital in photonic systems and enables many key devices, such as optical isolators, circulators and optical routers. Most conventional optical isolators involve magneto-optic materials, but devices based on optical nonlinearities, optomechanically induced transparency and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) have also been demonstrated. So far, however, they have only been implemented for linearly or randomly polarized LP01-like fundamental modes. Here we report a light-driven nonreciprocal isolator for optical vortex modes, based on topology-selective SBS in chiral photonic crystal fibre. The device can be reconfigured as an amplifier or an isolator by adjusting the frequency of the control signal. The experimental results show vortex isolation of 22 dB, which is at the state-of-the-art in fundamental mode isolators using SBS. This unique device may find applications in optical communications, fibre lasers, quantum information processing and optical tweezers. ",

    "abstract": "Following the explosive growth of global data, there is an ever-increasing demand for high-throughput optical fiber communication (OFC) systems to perform massive data transmission and processing. Existing OFC methods mainly rely on electronic circuits for data processing, which severely limits the communication throughput. Though considered promising for the next-generation high-speed fiber communication, all-optical OFC remains unachievable due to serious challenges in effective optical computing, system modeling and configuring. Here we propose an end-to-end photonic encoder-decoder (PED) processor which maps the physical system of OFC into an optical generative neural network. By modeling the OFC transmission process as the variation in the constructed optical latent space, the PED learns noise-resistant coding schemes via unsupervised optimization. With multi-layer parametric diffractive neural networks, the PED establishes a large-scale and high-throughput optical computing framework that integrates the main OFC computations including coding, encryption and compression to the optical domain. The whole system improves the latency of computation in OFC systems by five orders of magnitude compared with the state-of-the-art device. On benchmarking datasets, the PED experimentally achieves up to 32% reduction in transmission error ratio (ER) than on-off keying (OOK), one of the mainstream methods with the lowest ER in general transmission. As we demonstrate on medical data, the PED increases the transmission throughput by two orders of magnitude than 8-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-8). We believe the proposed photonic encoder-decoder processor not only paves the way to the next-generation all-optical OFC systems, but also promotes a wide range of AI-based physical system designs.

Desirable luminosities would be obtained by operating with very low charge per bunch but at extremely high repetition rates. And as a consequence of its unique operating parameter regime, coupling of the laser to the accelerator can potentially be in the 50\\% range and with low beamstrahlung energy loss due at the interaction point, making DLA a promising approach for a future multi-TeV linear collider.

The $\\epsilon$dC fluorescence is modified with respect to that of the canonical base dC, with a 3-fold increased lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. This behavior is amplified upon protonation of the etheno ring ($\\epsilon$dCH+). Quantum mechanical calculations show that the lowest energy state $\\pi$$\\pi$*1 is responsible for the fluorescence and that the main nonradiative decay pathway to the ground state goes through an ethene-like conical intersection, involving the out-of-plane motion of the C5 and C6 substituents.

This work reports a simple but powerful non-destructive characterisation technique, based on the formation of ultrasonic resonance from the repetitive layers within LIBs. A physical model is developed from the ground up, to interpret the results from standard experimental ultrasonic measurement setups. As output, the method delivers a range of critical pieces of information about the inner structure of LIBs, such as the number of layers, the average thicknesses of electrodes, the image of internal layers, and the states of charge variations across individual layers. This enables the quantitative tracking of internal cell properties, potentially providing new means of quality control during production processes, and tracking the states of health and charge during operation.

We show that the scattering of the cylinder generates both electric and magnetic C lines (i.e., lines of polarization singularities) in the near fields, and the C lines can induce complex force and torque on a dielectric/magnetic particle. The force and torque manifest dramatic spatial variations with interesting symmetry properties, providing rich degrees of freedom for near-field optical manipulations. The study, for the first time to our knowledge, uncovers the effect of optical polarization singularities on light-induced force and torque on small particles. The results contribute to the understanding of chiral light-matter interactions and can find applications in on-chip optical manipulations and optical sensing. ",

That helps, in particular, experiments with slow detectors or with low extraction rates. Furthermore, this technique is widely used for avoiding long gaps in the spill measured in ionisation chambers which in turn would trigger interlocks. On the other hand, the bunches create spill structures on time scales defined by the rf frequency. In addition, macroscopic spill structures of duration up to some hundred milliseconds can be created by the synchrotron motion for a sufficiently large synchrotron tune. The aim of this report is to study the influence of the synchrotron tune determined by amplitude and harmonic number of the rf voltage which additionally depends on the transverse emittance and the longitudinal bunch area of the circulating beam as well as the distribution of the particles' transit times.

This corresponds to laser irradiances several orders of magnitude below the minimum ignition energies reported in the literature. By placing a mirror inside a cylindrical vessel and filling it up to 100 bar with H2-He or O2-He non-combustible mixtures, we obtain the pressure-dependent absorptivity of the combustible He-H2-O2 mixture. We find no measurable absorption of the laser signal by the medium, for the overall pressure range, to the experimental apparatus sensitivity (about 1% of the laser irradiance). This leads credence to the theory that ignition stems from seed electrons created by autofocusing ionization of dust/impurities in the gas. ",

Traditionally, ranking is done by bisectioning search, which has poor cache performance on modern machines. We instead propose to use tries (prefix trees), thereby achieving a two- to ten-fold speed-up in numerical experiments with only moderate memory overhead. For the important problem of ranking permutations, the corresponding tries can be compressed. These compressed \"staggered\" lookups allow for a considerable speed-up while retaining the memory requirements of prior algorithms based on the combinatorial number system. ",
