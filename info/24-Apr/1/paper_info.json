    "abstract": "This paper addresses the central question of what a coherent concept of probability might look like that would do justice to both classical probability theory, axiomatized by Kolmogorov, and quantum theory. At a time when quanta are receiving increased and expanded attention -- think, for example, of the advances in quantum computers or the promises associated with this new technology (National Academies of Sciences: Engineering, and Medicine, 2019) -- an adequate interpretation of probability, which is no less important, should be given due attention, particularly with regard to quantum theory.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have considerable promise as high sensitivity magnetometers, however are commonly limited by inefficient collection and low contrasts. Laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) enables efficient collection and high contrasts, providing a path towards higher sensitivity magnetometry. We demonstrate an infrared LTM using an ensemble of NV centers in a single crystal diamond plate integrated into a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. The laser was tuned to the spin dependent absorption line of the NV centers, allowing for optical readout by monitoring the laser output power. We demonstrate a magnetic sensitivity of 7.5~nT/$\\sqrt{\\textit{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 10 and 50 Hz. Furthermore, the contrast and the projected PSNL sensitivity are shown to improve significantly by operating close to the lasing threshold, achieving 18.4\\% and 26.6~pT/$\\sqrt{\\textit{Hz}}$ near threshold. What's more, an unexpected saturable absorption phenomenon was observed near threshold, which enhanced the contrast and projected PSNL sensitivity. ",

The shock front destroys the wake thus stopping interaction between the laser pulse and accelerated electron bunch allowing one to directly control the interaction length and avoid dephasing. It also improves the electron beam quality through the plasma lensing effect between the two shock fronts. We demonstrated both experimentally and numerically how this approach can be used to form quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch with controlled energy and improved divergence as well as to track changes in the bunch parameters during acceleration.

With the increase of the radius of the monocyclic ring, as more electrons participate in the dipole oscillation the main excitation peaks are red-shifted to the lower energy. The highly symmetrical structures of cyclo[n]carbons (D_{nh}) possess degenerate levels, leading to simpler spectra with fewer peaks.

The quantitative description of urban human mobility has recently attracted the attention of researchers, and it highly related to urban science problems. Herein, combined with physics inspiration, we introduce a revised electric circuit model (RECM) in which moving people are regarded as charged particles and analogical concepts of electromagnetism such as human conductivity and human potential enable us to capture the characteristics of urban human mobility. We introduce the unit system, ensure the uniqueness of the calculation result, and reduce the computation cost of the algorithm to 1/10000 compared with the original ECM, making the model more universal and easier to use. We compared features including human conductivity and potential between different cities in Japan to show our improvement of the universality and the application range of the model. Furthermore, based on inspiration of physics, we propose a route generation model (RGM) to simulate a human flow pattern that automatically determines suitable routes between a given origin and destination as a source and sink, respectively. These discoveries are expected to lead to new approaches to the solution of urban science problems. ",

When applying the magnetic bias perpendicularly to the cylinder axis, the conductivity profile cross-section is nonuniform, which enables us to obtain pronounced nonreciprocal modes with different field distributions for propagation in opposite directions due to the coupling between different values of orbital angular momentum. We show that this property can be leveraged for directional power delivery when changing the source location, and we study the isolation ratio as a function of different parameters. The simple, continuous dependence of the isolation on the direction of magnetization allows simple yet robust control over the wave propagation properties. ",

The conductivity of our hydrogenated titanium dioxide is improved to 10.2 S cm$^{-1}$, 9 orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine titanium dioxide after 10 min plasma treatment. Plasma hydrogenation disrupts the surface crystal structure, introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) that create self-doped titanium(III) and titanium (II) species. First-principles calculations indicate the OVs raise the Fermi level of TiO$_2$ and distort the lattice nearby. Our optimized film has a distinctive periodic switching characteristic under intermittent illumination and good responsivity from 280 - 400 nm, peaking at 632.35 mA W^{-1}$ at 365 nm. The fabricated wearable sensor based on the optimized film effectively performs the monitoring of the daily variation of ambient UV intensity in three typical weather types and transferring its data to a smartphone via Wi-Fi.

    "abstract": "Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the photon pairs bunch at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.

    "abstract": "The human brain has immense learning capabilities at extreme energy efficiencies and scale that no artificial system has been able to match. For decades, reverse engineering the brain has been one of the top priorities of science and technology research. Despite numerous efforts, conventional electronics-based methods have failed to match the scalability, energy efficiency, and self-supervised learning capabilities of the human brain. On the other hand, very recent progress in the development of new generations of photonic and electronic memristive materials, device technologies, and 3D electronic-photonic integrated circuits (3D EPIC ) promise to realize new brain-derived neuromorphic systems with comparable connectivity, density, energy-efficiency, and scalability. When combined with bio-realistic learning algorithms and architectures, it may be possible to realize an 'artificial brain' prototype with general self-learning capabilities. This paper argues the possibility of reverse-engineering the brain through architecting a prototype of a brain-derived neuromorphic computing system consisting of artificial electronic, ionic, photonic materials, devices, and circuits with dynamicity resembling the bio-plausible molecular, neuro/synaptic, neuro-circuit, and multi-structural hierarchical macro-circuits of the brain based on well-tested computational models. We further argue the importance of bio-plausible local learning algorithms applicable to the neuromorphic computing system that capture the flexible and adaptive unsupervised and self-supervised learning mechanisms central to human intelligence. Most importantly, we emphasize that the unique capabilities in brain-derived neuromorphic computing prototype systems will enable us to understand links between specific neuronal and network-level properties with system-level functioning and behavior.

    "abstract": "Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$. Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the Axial Vortical Wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. We point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation is taken into account. ",

Due to the helical and axial vortical effects, perturbations in the vector charge in a rotating plasma can lead to chiral and helical charge transfer along the direction of the vorticity vector. At the same time, interactions between the plasma constituents lead to the dissipation of the helical charge through helicity-violating pair annihilation (HVPA) processes and of the axial charge through the axial anomaly. We will discuss separately a QED-like plasma, in which we ignore background electromagnetic fields and thus the axial charge is roughly conserved, as well as a QCD-like plasma, where instanton effects lead to the violation of the axial charge conservation, even in the absence of background chromomagnetic fields. The non-conservation of helicity and chirality leads to a gapping of the Helical, Axial and mixed, Axial-Helical vortical waves that prevents their infrared modes from propagating. On the other hand, usual dissipative effects, such as charge diffusion, lead to significant damping of ultraviolet modes. We end this paper with a discussion of the regimes where these vortical waves may propagate. ",

An external magnetic field, however, continuously drives the magnetic order towards layer-to-layer ferromagnetic, which opens spin-allowed charge-transfer channels between the layers. Here we elaborate how their admixture changes the composition and nature of the excitons, leading to an extension over many layers, and causes a quadratic red-shift with respect to the external magnetic field. We address these effects by ab-initio $GW$-BSE calculations as a function of magnetic field and cast the data into a minimal four-band model to elucidate the interplay between the various interaction and coupling mechanisms. Our findings should be generally valid for antiferromagnetic layered magnets with and without external magnetic fields, and moreover for any couple of layers with different spin directions.
