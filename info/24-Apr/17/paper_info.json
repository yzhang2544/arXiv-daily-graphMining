    "title": "Relating interfacial Rossby wave interaction in shear flows with  Feynman's two-state coupled quantum system model for the Josephson junction",
    "abstract": "Here we show how Feynman's simplified model for the Josephson junction, as a macroscopic two-state coupled quantum system, has a one-to-one correspondence with the stable dynamics of two interfacial Rossby waves in piecewise linear shear flows. The conservation of electric charge and energy of the superconducting electron gas layers become respectively equivalent to the conservation of wave action and pseudoenergy of the Rossby waves. Quantum-like tunneling is enabled via action-at-a-distance between the two Rossby waves. Furthermore, the quantum-like phenomena of avoided crossing between eigenstates, described by the Klein-Gordon equation, is obtained as well in the classical shear flow system. In the latter, it results from the inherent difference in pseudoenergy between the in-phase and anti-phased normal modes of the interfacial waves. This provides an intuitive physical meaning to the role of the wavefunction's phase in the quantum system. A partial analog to the quantum collapse of the wavefunction is also obtained due to the existence of a separatrix between \"normal mode regions of influence\" on the phase plane, describing the system's dynamics. As for two-state quantum bits (qubits), the two-Rossby wave system solutions can be represented on a Bloch sphere, where the Hadamard gate transforms the two normal modes/eigenstates into an intuitive computational basis in which only one interface is occupied by a Rossby wave. Yet, it is a classical system which lacks exact analogs to collapse and entanglement, thus cannot be used for quantum computation, even in principle. ",

    "abstract": "The creation and manipulation of coherence continues to capture the attention of scientists and engineers. The optical laser is a canonical example of a system that, in principle, exhibits complete coherence. Recent research has focused on the creation of coherent, laser-like states in other physical systems. The phonon laser is one example where it is possible to amplify self-sustained mechanical oscillations. A single mode phonon laser in a levitated optical tweezer has been demonstrated through appropriate balance of active feedback gain and damping. In this work, coherent control of the dynamics of an optical tweezer phonon laser is used to share coherence between its different modes of oscillation, creating a multimode phonon laser. The coupling of the modes is achieved by periodically rotating the asymmetric optical potential in the transverse focal plane of the trapping beam via trap laser polarization rotation. The presented theory and experiment demonstrate that coherence can be transferred across different modes of an optical tweezer phonon laser, and are a step toward using these systems for precision measurement and quantum information processing.

    "abstract": "We report the realization of the first planar optical tweezer trap system by a sheet of light. To visualize the trapping of the target object (dielectric bead or live cell) in a plane, an orthogonal widefield detection is employed. The planar / two-dimensional lightsheet optical tweezer (2D-LOT) sub-system is realized in an inverted microscopy mode with illumination from the bottom. A 1064 nm laser (power $\\sim 500 mW$) is expanded and directed to a combination of cylindrical lens and high NA objective lens to generate a tightly-focused diffraction-limited light sheet. The object to be trapped is injected in the specimen chamber (consists of two coverslips placed at a distance of $\\approx 1~mm$) using a syringe. The illumination of trap-laser light is along Z-direction (with coverslip along XZ-plane) whereas, the detection is achieved perpendicular to the coverslip (along Y-axis). The orthogonal detection is employed to directly visualize the trapping in a plane. The characterization of system PSF estimates the size of light sheet trap PSF to be, $2073.84 ~\\mu m^2$ which defines the active trap region / area. Beads are tracked on their way to the trap region for determining the trap stiffness along Z and X i.e, $k_z = 1.13 \\pm 0.034 ~pN/\\mu m$ and $k_x = 0.74 \\pm 0.021 ~pN/ \\mu m$. Results (image and video) show real-time trapping of dielectric beads in the trap zone (2D plane) generated by the light sheet. The beads can be seen getting trapped from all directions in the XZ-plane. Prolonged exposure to the light sheet builds up a 2D array of beads in the trap zone. Similar experiments on live NIH3T3 cells show cells trapped in the 2D trap. The potential of the planar trap lies in its ability to confine objects in two dimensions, thereby opening new kinds of experiments in biophysics, atomic physics, and optical physics. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, meta-surface(MS) has emerged as a promising alternative method for generating vortex waves. At the same time, MS also face the problem of narrow bandwidth, in order to obtain a board bandwidth, the MS unit cells structure become more and more complex, which will deduce many inconveniences to the preparation process of MS device. Therefore, we want to design a simple MS unit cell with a multi-frequency selection. In this paper, based on the principle of geometric phase, we design a simple reflective MS unit cell based on metal double-slit resonant ring. We elaborate on the resonance mechanism of the MS unit cell. Under the normal incidence of circularly polarized (CP) waves, the reflection coefficient of the same polarization was greater than 85%. By rotating the orientation angle of the resonator on the MS unit cell, the continuous 2pi phase coverage was satisfied in the frequency range of 0.52THz-1.1THz, and the relative bandwidth becomes 71.6%. Based on this, we construct a vortex generator by using a 15*15 MS unit array. The right-handed circularly polarized waves (RCP) and left-handed circularly polarized waves (LCP) are separately incident on MS with topological charges of l=1,2,3 under multiple resonant frequencies. The generated RCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=-1,-2,-3 and the generated LCP vortex wave with topological charges of l=1,2,3. The numerical simulation results exhibit our designed MS with multiple resonance outcomes can achieve a multi-broadband operation and generate a wide-band vortex beam. In addition, we also calculate the pattern purity. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we prove that our designed MS can generate a broadband vortex wave. ",

In this study, a comprehensive in-orbit model is developed for a Mach-Zehnder-type cold-atom accelerometer. Performance tests are realized under different assumptions, and the impact of various sources of errors on instrument stability is evaluated. Current and future advances for space-based atom interferometry are discussed, and their impact on the performance of quantum sensors on-board satellite gravity missions is investigated in three different scenarios: state-of-the-art scenario, near-future (between the next 5 and 10 years) and far-future scenarios (between the next 10 to 20 years). We show that one can achieve a sensitivity level close to 5E-10 with the current state-of-the-art technology. We also estimate that in the near and far-future, atom interferometry in space is expected to achieve sensitivity levels of 1E-11 and 1E-12, respectively. A roadmap for improvements in atom interferometry is provided that would maximize the performance of future CAI accelerometers, considering their technical capabilities. Finally, the possibility and challenges of having ultra-sensitive atom interferometry in space for future space missions are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Nonreciprocal nonequilibrium process are attracting growing interest in sociology, animal behaviour, chemistry, and nanotechnology, and may have played a role in the origin of life. It is less widely recognized, however, that in open systems light can induce nonreciprocal predator-prey like forces between nanoparticles. Such forces provide access to the continuous time crystal state of matter, which has been demonstrated in a plasmonic metamaterial array of nanowires wherein light triggers a spontaneous mobilization transition to the robust oscillatory state, breaking time translation symmetry. Here, we report on the first experimental study of the transient dynamics of light-induced mobilization and demobilization in a time crystal. By analysing time resolved phase trajectories of the system of nanowires, we show that the mobilization transition is accompanied by breaking of continuous time translation symmetry and ergodicity, and a decrease in the entropy of motion. This insight into the transient dynamics of a nonreciprocity-driven time crystal is relevant to optical timetronics, an information and communications technology paradigm relying on the unique functionalities of time crystals, and applications of the interacting nanowire oscillator platform to modelling a wide range of nonreciprocal processes from many-body dynamics to the early stages of matter-to-life transitions.

The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible. ",

In this study, we present experimental results and discuss the scaling potential for such DC sources. We first demonstrate the operation of a commercial discrete operational amplifier down to 1.2K which is used on the DC source prototype. Then, the tunability of the memristor-based DC source is validated by performing several 250mV-DC sweeps with a resolution of 10mV at room temperature and at 1.2K. Additionally, the DC source prototype exhibits a limited output drift of $\\approx1\\mathrm{\\mu Vs^{-1}}$ at 1.2K. This showcases the potential of memristor-based DC sources for quantum dot biasing. Limitations in power consumption and voltage resolution using discrete components highlight the need for a fully integrated and scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based (CMOS-based) approach. To address this, we propose to monolithically co-integrate emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) and 65nm CMOS circuitry. Simulations reveal a reduction in power consumption, down to $\\mathrm{10\\mu W}$ per DC source and in footprint. This allows for the integration of up to one million eNVM-based DC sources at the 4.2K stage of a dilution fridge, paving the way for near term large-scale quantum computing applications. ",
