The electromagnetic fields at wavelengths 968 nm and 1030 nm have been normally and axially directed to the dimer axis. Wavelengths 968 nm and 1030 nm are resonant with the electron transitions of the Yb3+ ions and can generate the Stokes and anti-Stokes cycles, respectively. It has been shown that the electromagnetic field propagating at wavelength 1030 nm not only can be used to control optical forces applied to the dimer, but can cause cooling of the dimer, which is desirable in a number of applications.

We utilized this technology to determine the absolute frequency of diverse neutral Yb isotopes across its $6s^2\\ ^{1}S_0\\to 6s6p ^{1}P_1$ transitions. Furthermore, the first-ever observation of in-situ Doppler-free Zeeman sub-level spectra was accomplished, enabling the determination of magnetic field gradients. We stabilized a UV diode laser at 399 nm using an error signal derived from the spectral first-derivative demodulated signal of $^{174}\\mathrm{Yb}$. This technique yielded a frequency stability of up to 15 kHz with a 40 s averaging time and a standard deviation of around 180 kHz over a half-hour period. Given its low cost, straightforward, and scalable nature, TDMDSAS holds excellent potential in metrology and quantum applications. ",

    "abstract": "In orthodox Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) bases and factorizations are considered to define quantum states and entanglement in relativistic terms. While the choice of a basis (interpreted as a measurement context) defines a state incompatible to that same state in a different basis, the choice of a factorization (interpreted as the separability of systems into sub-systems) determines wether the same state is entangled or non-entangled. Of course, this perspectival relativism with respect to reference frames and factorizations precludes not only the widespread reference to quantum particles but more generally the possibility of any rational objective account of a state of affairs in general. In turn, this impossibility ends up justifying the instrumentalist (anti-realist) approach that contemporary quantum physics has followed since the establishment of SQM during the 1930s. In contraposition, in this work, taking as a standpoint the logos categorical approach to QM -- basically, Heisenberg's matrix formulation without Dirac's projection postulate -- we provide an invariant account of bases and factorizations which allows us to to build a conceptual-operational bridge between the mathematical formalism and quantum phenomena. In this context we are able to address the set of equivalence relations which allows us to determine what is actually the same in different bases and factorizations. ",

The model allows to reevaluate the effectiveness of conventional imaging recording, processing, and perception and to analyze the limiting factors that constrain image recognition capabilities in atmospheric media. The simulations were compared with the experimental results measured in a fog chamber and outdoor settings. The results reveal general good agreement between analysis and experimental, pointing out the way to harnessing the physical limit for optical imaging in scattering media. An immediate application of the study is the extension of the image range by an amount of 1.2 times with noise reduction via multi-frame averaging, hence greatly enhancing the capability of optical imaging in the atmosphere.

    "abstract": "Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping deeply sub-wavelength particles in all spatial directions using the gradient force has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a nanometer-sized trapped particle experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at near-infrared and optical frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.

We observe significant variations in the dynamics of magnetization suppression and subsequent recovery when triggered with two optical pulses of the same polarization-essentially meeting conditions for interference. Conversely, dynamics triggered with cross-polarized pump beams exhibit expected similarity to that triggered with a single pulse. Delving into the underlying physical processes contributing to laser-induced demagnetization and recovery dynamics, we find that our current understanding cannot elucidate the observed trends.

Using aluminum-coated multilayer samples we can differentiate between ultrafast surface morphology dynamics and subsequent subsurface density dynamics, achieving nanometer-depth sensitivity and subpicosecond temporal resolution.

Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields. For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.

The calculations for ice VIII are within the experimental uncertainty for both CASSCF and VQE-SCF for oxygen and lie close to the experimental value for ice IX as well. With the VQE-SCF, which is based on an Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored (ADAPT) ansatz, we find that the inclusion of the environment and the size of the different basis sets do not directly affect the gate counts. However, by including an explicit environment, the wavefunction and, therefore, the optimization problem becomes more complicated, which usually results in the need to include more operators from the operator pool, thereby increasing the depth of the circuit.

Similar waves were previously reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of $\\sim 60$ solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3 to 10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that chirp up or down in time. Using a semi-automated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for acceleration of the solar wind. ",

The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).

    "abstract": "We present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. Without direct image reconstruction, it classifies an object in terms of the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the same behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical neuron (that is at least linear in the image resolution). We provide simulations and analytical comparisons with analogous neural network architectures. ",
