    "abstract": "The emerging field of topology has brought device effects to a new level. Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) go beyond traditional descriptions of bulk-edge correspondence, broadening the understanding of topologically insulating phases. In this paper, a second-order split-ring photonic crystal (SSPC) with zero-dimensional (0D) corner states and one-dimensional (1D) edge states is proposed. Based on the coupling strength determined by the opening direction between the split-rings, the electronic transition strength of the electronic system is imitated, and the topological trivial and non-trivial transformation of the topological two-dimensional (2D) SSH model are realized by using the rotating split-ring lattice. Theory and simulation find that SSPC has non-trivial topological edge states that can be quantified by bulk polarization. As the opening direction of the split-rings gradually changes within one period, there will be transitions between four different topological polarizations of the lowest energy bands, which can be conveniently used to achieve transitions between different topological phases. Our research can be extended to higher dimensions and broaden research paths for higher-order photonic topological insulators and semimetals. ",

Based on this formula, a comparative analysis of the sensitivity of defected PCs with and without mirror symmetry was carried out. In addition, the exact values of sensitivity in the limit of an infinite PC with a quarter-wave unit cell were obtained. It was shown that the sensitivity of a defective PC with an infinitely thick defect layer is equal to that of a perfectly reflecting Fabry-Perot resonator and does not depend on the specific structure of the PC. The results of this work provide a significant simplification of the analysis and optimization of optical sensors based on defective PCs, as well as a better understanding of the numerous numerical results obtained previously.

The interplay between the beam's Gaussian profile and the self-focusing mechanism through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, particularly in the presence of plasma-induced nonlinearities are elucidated here. Our findings reveal crucial insights into the evolution of laser beams under diverse parameters, the ponderomotive force, relativistic factors, plasma frequency, polarization states, external magnetic field, wavelength, and laser intensity.

Existing models, however, only address narrowly tailored classes of problems and only scale to systems of a few dozen degrees of freedom (DoFs). Here, we demonstrate a single, unified model capable of addressing scattering simulations with thousands of DoFs, of any wavelength, any illumination wavefront, and freeform materials, within broad configurable bounds. Based on an attentional multi-conditioning strategy, our method also allows non-recurrent supervision on and prediction of intermediate physical states, which provides improved generalization with no additional data-generation cost. Using this O(1)-time intermediate prediction capability, we propose and prove a rigorous, efficiently computable upper bound on prediction error, allowing accuracy guarantees at inference time for all predictions. After training solely on randomized systems, we demonstrate the unified model across a suite of challenging multi-disciplinary inverse problems, finding strong efficacy and speed improvements up to 96% for problems in optical tomography, beam shaping through volumetric random media, and freeform photonic inverse design, with no problem-specific training. Our findings demonstrate a path to universal, verifiably accurate neural surrogates for existing scattering simulators, and our conditioning and training methods are directly applicable to any PDE admitting a time-domain iterative solver.

This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling non-destructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present high-internal-quality-factor coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWR) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs.

The mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied on a porous carbon electrode in an oxygen saturated solution of 0.1M Lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI) in Dimethoxyethane (DME) using cyclic voltammetery (CV) and the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of the porosity and the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us and the rate constant of the elementary reactions calculated. The rates constant for the electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the film pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical. ",

Here we provide an overview of the recent experimental, numerical and theoretical studies which revealed those new properties. It will be shown that multimode fiber solitons form with specific pulse width and energy dependent on the wavelength, and that they naturally evolve toward fundamental-mode Raman solitons. New soliton fission mechanisms, governed by the modal dispersion, will be explained. Possible applications in space-division multiplexed systems will be discussed.

We derive and classify several analytic interference conditions for single-channel RESI in arbitrary driving fields, and address specific issues for few-cycle pulses. Since the cycles in a short pulse are no longer equivalent, there are several events whose dominance varies. We quantify this dominance for single excitation channels by proposing a dominance parameter. Moreover, there will be many more types of superimposed interference fringes that must be taken into consideration. We find an intricate tapestry of patterns arising from phase differences related to symmetrization, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference. ",

Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.

Here we show that the performance of a quantum CMM sensor can be significantly enhanced beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), by squeezing the magnons. We find that, for comparable parameters, two orders of enhancement in force sensitivity can be achieved in comparison with the case without the magnon squeezing. Moreover, we show optimal parameter regimes of homodyne angle for minimizing added quantum noise.
