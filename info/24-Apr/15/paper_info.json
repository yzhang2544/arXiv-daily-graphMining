    "abstract": "The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($\\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP ($\\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero. The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.

    "abstract": "Photonic time crystals (PTCs) host momentum bandgaps enabling intriguing non-resonant light amplification in propagating waves, but opening substantial bandgaps demands refractive index changes too extreme for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we introduce momentum bandgaps for non-uniform waves, including evanescent and ghost types, by extending PTCs to biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals that periodically alternate between uniform biaxial anisotropy and isotropic media over time. We show that ghost waves, unlike evanescent waves, sustain only momentum bandgaps, opening wide bandgaps at even the smallest modulation depths. Moreover, we demonstrate momentum bandgap effects on non-uniform waves that can be amplified, or through decaying modes, selectively attenuated. We find that ghost wave momentum bandgaps uniquely boost refracted over reflected waves under one-way incidence, in stark contrast to balanced amplification seen in both propagating and evanescent waves. Our approach expands time-varying metamaterials by integrating wave characteristics, bridging the gap between conventional nonlinear optics and PTC momentum bandgaps, and shedding new light on extreme manipulation of surface polaritons.

    "abstract": "Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability (ARTI) and nonlocal heat transport are the critical problems in laser-driven inertial confinement fusion, while their coupling with each other is not completely understood yet. Here the ARTI in the presence of nonlocal heat transport is studied self-consistently for the first time theoretically and by using radiation hydrodynamic simulations. It is found that the nonlocal heat flux generated by the hot electron transport tends to attenuate the growth of instability, especially for short wavelength perturbations. A linear theory of the ARTI coupled with the nonlocal heat flux is developed, and a prominent stabilization of the ablation front via the nonlocal heat flux is found, in good agreement with numerical simulations. This effect becomes more significant as the laser intensity increases. Our results should have important references for the target designing for inertial confinement fusion. ",

Current design includes a 100 kV thermionic DC electron gun with an RF grid, 1-cell normal-conducting buncher cavity, and Nb$_{3}$Sn superconducting cavities to accelerate the beam to the final energy of 10 MeV. The goal of the present beam dynamics study is the beam loss suppression (to the ppm level), since it results in a thermal load on the cavity. Then the beam performance at the accelerator exit should be confirmed. The main issue was to transport the beam without loss, since the initial electron energy (100 keV) is low, and the beam parameters are intricately correlated. In addition, the space charge effect is considerable. For this reason, simultaneous optimization of multiple parameters was necessary. Here we report optimization results and their effect on the design of the machine. ",

    "abstract": "Molecular docking (MD) is a crucial task in drug design, which predicts the position, orientation, and conformation of the ligand when bound to a target protein. It can be interpreted as a combinatorial optimization problem, where quantum annealing (QA) has shown promising advantage for solving combinatorial optimization. In this work, we propose a novel quantum molecular docking (QMD) approach based on QA-inspired algorithm. We construct two binary encoding methods to efficiently discretize the degrees of freedom with exponentially reduced number of bits and propose a smoothing filter to rescale the rugged objective function. We propose a new quantum-inspired algorithm, hopscotch simulated bifurcation (hSB), showing great advantage in optimizing over extremely rugged energy landscapes. This hSB can be applied to any formulation of objective function under binary variables. An adaptive local continuous search is also introduced for further optimization of the discretized solution from hSB. Concerning the stability of docking, we propose a perturbation detection method to help ranking the candidate poses. We demonstrate our approach on a typical dataset. QMD has shown advantages over the search-based Autodock Vina and the deep-learning DIFFDOCK in both re-docking and self-docking scenarios. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can be applied to solve practical problems in the drug discovery even before quantum hardware become mature. ",

    "abstract": "There is a significant need for precise and reliable forecasting of the far-field noise emanating from shipping vessels. Conventional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes equations are unsuitable, and sophisticated model reduction methods may be ineffective for accurately predicting far-field noise in environments with seamounts and significant variations in bathymetry. Recent advances in reduced-order models, particularly those based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, offer a faster and more accurate alternative. These models use convolutional neural networks to reduce data dimensions effectively. However, current deep-learning models face challenges in predicting wave propagation over long periods and for remote locations, often relying on auto-regressive prediction and lacking far-field bathymetry information. This research aims to improve the accuracy of deep-learning models for predicting underwater radiated noise in far-field scenarios. We propose a novel range-conditional convolutional neural network that incorporates ocean bathymetry data into the input. By integrating this architecture into a continual learning framework, we aim to generalize the model for varying bathymetry worldwide. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze our model on several test cases and a benchmark scenario involving far-field prediction over Dickin's seamount in the Northeast Pacific. Our proposed architecture effectively captures transmission loss over a range-dependent, varying bathymetry profile. This architecture can be integrated into an adaptive management system for underwater radiated noise, providing real-time end-to-end mapping between near-field ship noise sources and received noise at the marine mammal's location.

The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering. ",

We derive nonlinear equations for the envelope of electrostatic potential at the ion-ion hybrid frequency to describe the interaction of ion-ion hybrid waves with low frequency acoustic-type disturbances. The resulting nonlinear equations also take into account the contribution of second harmonics of the ion-ion hybrid frequency. A nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained and, for a number of particular cases, the modulational instability growth rates are found. By neglecting the contribution of second harmonics, the phenomenon of collapse of ion-ion hybrid waves is predicted. It is shown that taking into account the interaction with the second harmonics results in the existence of a stable two-dimensional soliton. ",

    "abstract": "Cell segmentation is essential in biomedical research for analyzing cellular morphology and behavior. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have revolutionized cell segmentation by extracting intricate features from images. However, the robustness of these methods under microscope optical aberrations remains a critical challenge. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of cell instance segmentation models under simulated aberration conditions using the DynamicNuclearNet (DNN) and LIVECell datasets. Aberrations, including Astigmatism, Coma, Spherical, and Trefoil, were simulated using Zernike polynomial equations. Various segmentation models, such as Mask R-CNN with different network heads (FPN, C3) and backbones (ResNet, VGG19, SwinS), were trained and tested under aberrated conditions. Results indicate that FPN combined with SwinS demonstrates superior robustness in handling simple cell images affected by minor aberrations. Conversely, Cellpose2.0 proves effective for complex cell images under similar conditions. Our findings provide insights into selecting appropriate segmentation models based on cell morphology and aberration severity, enhancing the reliability of cell segmentation in biomedical applications. Further research is warranted to validate these methods with diverse aberration types and emerging segmentation models. Overall, this research aims to guide researchers in effectively utilizing cell segmentation models in the presence of minor optical aberrations. ",

From a technical perspective, we develop and utilize tools for the block encoding of specific matrices as well as their multiplication.
