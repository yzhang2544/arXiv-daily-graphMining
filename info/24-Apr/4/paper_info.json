    "abstract": "What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this paper, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation in the presence of noise in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average, and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the players' behavior in the thermodynamic limit, and we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighboring players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \\textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \\textit{Quantum} and the \\textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this paper demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of the one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.

Instead of simulating the fluid mechanics equations directly, the proposed method uses a lattice Boltzmann model that reproduces the wave equation, together with a kernel interpolation scheme, to compute the first order perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields on the object's surface and, from them, the acoustic radiation force. The procedure reproduces with excellent accuracy the theoretical expressions by Gor'kov and Wei for the sphere and the disk, respectively, even with a modest number of lattice Boltzmann cells.

    "title": "A coarse-grained description of anharmonic lattice environments  affecting the quantum dynamics of charge carriers",
    "abstract": "Lattice softness has a significant impact on charge carrier dynamics in condensed matter systems, contributing to the emergence of various properties and functions. Examples include the remarkable carrier lifetimes and defect tolerances of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Recent studies suggest the contribution of quartic anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations. The quartic anharmonicity can be discussed with a double-well potential, and the transition between the two minima can be coarse-grained as a two-state jump stochastic process. Such a stochastic approach is typically employed to describe dynamic fluctuations introduced into a system by two-state transitions in the surroundings. To investigate charge transport in materials, however, it is crucial to describe not only the fluctuations but also the dynamic lattice distortion associated with charge transport. Therefore, there is a need for a theory to describe the charge carrier dynamics proceeding alongside the lattice distortion dynamics. In this study, we present a theory that describes quantum dynamics under the influence of an environment with two stable states, termed a bistable environment. The theory describes the effects of fluctuations and dissipation induced from the bistable environment in a reasonable manner, and the effects exhibit a different temperature dependence than the widely employed Gaussian environment. The physical implication of this temperature dependence is provided in terms of the environmental dynamics. The results of this study are expected to provide a step forward in describing charge carrier dynamics in materials with lattice softness and pronounced lattice anharmonicity, e.g., hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Moreover, these findings represent an advancement in our understanding of and capacity to predict and control the physical properties and functions of these materials. ",

The group velocity of the topological guided mode hosted in a VPhC heterostructure can be slowed down by shifting the VPhC lattice toward the graphene-like PhC at the domain interfaces. Simultaneously, the mode width of the slow-light topological guided mode can be widened by increasing the size of the graphene-like PhC domain. We found that employing the graphene-like structure at the center domain is crucial for realizing a topological single-guided mode in such heterostructures. Furthermore, the impact of random fluctuations in air-hole size in the graphene-like domain was numerically investigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that the transmittance for the slow-light states can be kept high as far as the size fluctuation is small although it drops faster than that for fast-light states when the disorder level increases. The designed wide-mode-area slow-light waveguides are based on hole-based PhCs, offering novel on-chip applications of topological waveguides. ",

However, direct optical inspection of such integrated chips with densely packed complex and small features remains a missing metrology gap that hinders quick feedback between design and fabrications. Here, we demonstrate that photothermal nonlinear scattering microscopy can be utilized for direct imaging and resolving of integrated optoelectronic chips beyond the diffraction limit. We reveal that the inherent coupling among deep-subwavelength nanostructures supporting leaky resonances allows for the pronounced heating effect to access reversible nonlinear modulations of the confocal reflection intensity, leading to optical resolving power down to 80 nm (~lambda/7). The versatility of this approach has been exemplified by direct imaging of silicon grating couplers and metalens with a minimum critical dimension of 100 nm, as well as central processing unit (CPU) chip with 45 nm technology, unfolding the long-sought possibility of in-situ, non-destructive, high-throughput optical inspection of integrated optoelectronic chips and nanophotonic chips.

We demonstrate the role of the optical penetration depths on the cavity modes and provide practical working equations for its analysis.

Traditionally, acquiring these properties has relied on methods such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or vector network analyzers (VNA), demanding rigorous sample preparation and entailing a significant expenditure of time. However, such measurements are not always feasible, particularly in novel and uncharacterized scenarios. In this work, we propose a new approach for channel modeling that leverages the inherent sensing capabilities of THz channels. By comparing the results obtained through channel sensing with that derived from THz-TDS measurements, we demonstrate the method's ability to yield dependable surface property information. The application of this approach in both a miniaturized cityscape scenario and an indoor environment has shown consistency with experimental measurements, thereby verifying its effectiveness in real-world settings.

The purpose of this work is to develop a thermodynamic theory that takes into account the synergistic action of multiple components. We find that the type of the nonlinearity involved can have important implications in the thermalization process and, hence, can lead to different thermal equilibrium conditions. Importantly, we derive closed-form expressions for the actual optomechanical pressure that is exerted on the system. In particular, the total optomechanical pressure is the sum of the partial pressures due to each component. Our results can be applied to a variety of weakly nonlinear optical settings such as multimode fibers, bulk waveguides, photonic lattices, and coupled microresonators.

This platform supports the scalability of quantum walks to a large number of steps while retaining a significant degree of programmability. More importantly, ultrafast time bins are encoded at the picosecond time scale, far away from mechanical fluctuations. This enables the scalability of our platform to many modes while preserving excellent interferometric phase stability over extremely long periods of time without requiring active phase stabilization.

    "abstract": "Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are designed to act as device 'fingerprints.' Given an input challenge, the PUF circuit should produce an unpredictable response for use in situations such as root-of-trust applications and other hardware-level cybersecurity applications. PUFs are typically subcircuits present within integrated circuits (ICs), and while conventional IC PUFs are well-understood, several implementations have proven vulnerable to malicious exploits, including those perpetrated by machine learning (ML)-based attacks. Such attacks can be difficult to prevent because they are often designed to work even when relatively few challenge-response pairs are known in advance. Hence the need for both more resilient PUF designs and analysis of ML-attack susceptibility. Previous work has developed a PUF for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). A PIC PUF not only produces unpredictable responses given manufacturing-introduced tolerances, but is also less prone to electromagnetic radiation eavesdropping attacks than a purely electronic IC PUF. In this work, we analyze the resilience of the proposed photonic PUF when subjected to ML-based attacks. Specifically, we describe a computational PUF model for producing the large datasets required for training ML attacks; we analyze the quality of the model; and we discuss the modeled PUF's susceptibility to ML-based attacks. We find that the modeled PUF generates distributions that resemble uniform white noise, explaining the exhibited resilience to neural-network-based attacks designed to exploit latent relationships between challenges and responses. Preliminary analysis suggests that the PUF exhibits similar resilience to generative adversarial networks, and continued development will show whether more-sophisticated ML approaches better compromise the PUF and -- if so -- how design modifications might improve resilience.
