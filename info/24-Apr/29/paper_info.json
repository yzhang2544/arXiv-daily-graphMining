    "title": "Rotating spintronic terahertz emitter optimized for microjoule  pump-pulse energies and megahertz repetition rates",
    "abstract": "Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) are powerful sources of ultra-broadband single-cycle terahertz (THz) field transients. They work with any pump wavelength, and their polarity and polarization direction are easily adjustable. However, at high pump powers and high repetition rates, STE operation is hampered by a significant increase in the local temperature. Here, we resolve this issue by rotating the STE at a few 100 Hz, thereby distributing the absorbed pump power over a larger area. Our approach permits stable STE operation at a fluence of ~1 mJ/cm$^2$ with up to 18 W pump power at megahertz repetition rates, corresponding to pump-pulse energies of a few 10 $\\mu$J and a power density far above the melting threshold of metallic films. The rotating STE is of interest for all ultra-broadband high-power THz applications requiring high repetition rates. As an example, we show that THz pulses with peak fields of 10 kV/cm can be coupled to a THz-lightwave-driven scanning tunneling microscope at 1 MHz repetition rate, demonstrating that the rotating STE can compete with standard THz sources such as LiNbO$_3$.

    "abstract": "High-contrast refractive indexes are pivotal in dielectric metasurfaces for inducing various exotic phenomena, such as the bound state in the continuum (BIC) and electric mirror (EM). However, the limitations of high-index materials are adverse to the practical applications, thus low-contrast metasurfaces with comparable performance are highly desired. Here we present a low-contrast dielectric metasurface comprising radially anisotropic cylinders, which are SiO2 cylinders doped with a small amount of WS2. The cylinder exhibits unidirectional forward superscattering originating from the overlapping of the electric and magnetic dipole resonances. When normal illumination by a near-infrared plane wave, the metasurface consisting of the superscattering constituents manifests a polarization-insensitive EM. Conversely, when subjected to an in-plane incoming wave, the metasurface generates a symmetry-protected BIC characterized by an ultrahigh Q factor and nearly negligible out-of-plane energy radiation. Our work highlights the doping approach as an efficient strategy for designing low-contrast functional metasurfaces and sheds new light on the potential applications in photonic integrated circuits and on-chip optical communication.

    "abstract": "In this study, fluid flow inside of an obstructed channel under the influence of magnetic field has been analyzed using physics informed neural networks(PINNs). Governing equations have been utilized in low-order form and the solution has been obtained in dimensionless form. Geometric and physics-related dimensionless parameters have been used as input variables of the neural network in the learning process. The radius and longitudinal position of the obstruction have also been involved in the learning process and the problem has been solved parametrically. In the successive sections of the study, inverse problem has been a matter of interest, particularly in form of obtaining the Hartmann number using the proposed method. The results have indicated that the employed method determined the Hartmann number with great accuracy and entailed proper results. In this study a thorough exploration of effects of physical and geometric parameters on the magnetically influenced flow through a duct has been carried out. The accuracy of the results obtained from the solving method proposed have been compared to results generated by common methods used in computational fluid mechanics. The parametric solution of the problem can serve as a powerful tool in optimization problems. The method was also applicable to cases where the parameters were outside of defined range, indicating it's generalization capabilities. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, all of which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high quality factors and strong near-field enhancement. Here, we quantitatively investigate the mode formation in quasi-BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique. We find that the quasi-BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10 x 10-unit cells much smaller than expected from far-field measurements. Furthermore, we show that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi-BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far-field and near-field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.

Compared to state-of-the-art sensors using room-temperature vapors, cold atoms allow longer interaction times, better isolation from the environment and a reduced Doppler effect. Our approach is particularly simple as the detection relies on fluorescence measurements only. Moreover, our signal is well described by a two-level model across a broad measurement range, allowing in principle to reconstruct the amplitude and the frequency of the microwave field simultaneously without the need for an external reference field. We report on a scale factor linearity at the percent level and no noticeable drifts over two hours, paving the way for new applications of cold Rydberg atoms in metrology such as calibrating blackbody shifts in state-of-the-art optical clocks, monitoring the Earth cryosphere from space, measuring the cosmic microwave background or searching for dark matter.

    "abstract": "Nonlinearity induced nonreciprocity is studied in a system comprising two resonators coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide when the linear system does not exhibit nonreciprocity. The analysis is based on the Hamiltonian of the coupled system and includes the dissipative coupling between the waveguide and resonators, along with the input-output relations. We consider a large number of scenarios which can lead to nonreciprocity. We pay special attention to the case when the linear system does not exhibit nonreciprocal behavior. In this case, we show how very significant nonreciprocal behavior can result from Kerr nonlinearities. We find that the bistability of the nonlinear system can aid in achieving large nonreciprocity. Additionally, We bring out nonreciprocity in the excitation of each resonator, which can be monitored independently. Our results highlight the profound influence of nonlinearity on nonreciprocal behavior, offering a new avenue for controlling light propagation in integrated photonic circuits. Nonlinearity induced nonreciprocity would lead to significant nonreciprocity in quantum fluctuations when our system is treated quantum mechanically. ",
