    "title": "(Pseudo-)Synthetic BRST quantisation of the bosonic string and the  higher quantum origin of dualities",
    "abstract": "In this article I am arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the origin of gauge and string dualities in general can be found in a higher-categorical interpretation of basic quantum mechanics. It is interesting to observe that the Galilei group has a non-trivial cohomology, while the Lorentz/Poincare group has trivial cohomology. When we constructed quantum mechanics, we noticed the non-trivial cohomology structure of the Galilei group and hence, we required for a proper quantisation procedure that would be compatible with the symmetry group of our theory, to go to a central extension of the Galilei group universal covering by co-cycle. This would be the Bargmann group. However, Nature didn't choose this path. Instead in nature, the Galilei group is not realised, while the Lorentz group is. The fact that the Galilei group has topological obstructions leads to a central charge, the mass, and a superselection rule, required to implement the Galilei symmetry, that forbids transitions between states of different mass. The topological structure of the Lorentz group however lacks such an obstruction, and hence allows for transitions between states of different mass. The connectivity structure of the Lorentz group as opposed to that of the Galilei group can be interpreted in the sense of an ER=EPR duality for the topological space associated to group cohomology. In string theory we started with the Witt algebra, and due to similar quantisation issues, we employed the central extension by co-cycle to obtain the Virasoro algebra. This is a unique extension for orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on a circle, but there is no reason to believe that, at the high energy domain in physics where this would apply, we do not have a totally different structure altogether and the degrees of freedom present there would require something vastly more general and global.

TBC degradation, initiated by interfacial defects from the LASAT method, was studied during thermal gradient cycling under fast and slow cooling. In-situ optical and infrared imaging, along with ex-situ SEM cross-sectional analysis, monitored failure mechanisms. The Laser Shock for Damage Monitoring (LASDAM) technique provided insights into gradient and cooling rate impacts on columnar TBC damage. Results showed significant effects of cooling rate on delamination and localized failure at blister sites, with LASDAM revealing significant overheating at damage sites. Analysis included full-field temperature and damage assessment, emphasizing blister-driven delamination under severe thermal gradients. Discussion focused on elastic stored energy effects, noting that fast cooling induced transient conditions where reversed temperature gradients increased damage, limiting TBC lifespan ",

    "abstract": "Optical interferometric imaging enables astronomical observation at extremely high angular resolution. The necessary optical information for imaging, such as the optical path differences and visibilities, is easy to extract from fringes generated by the combination of two beams. With more than two apertures, the image-plane interference pattern becomes an increasingly indistinguishable mixture of fringe spacings and directions. For decades, the state-of-the-art approaches for obtaining two-aperture fringes from an interferometer array composed of many apertures are limited to pairwise combinations using bulk optics. Here, we derive and demonstrate a fringe disentanglement theory that can digitally transform the interference pattern of N apertures to N(N-1)/2 pairwise fringes without any optics, thus providing straightforward methods of information acquisition for interferometers. We demonstrate applications of our technique by both simulation and experiment, showing that this theory can be used for simultaneously sensing pistons and determining the individual visibilities of all combining apertures. Furthermore, we use the proposed theory to phase a 1.5-meter segmented flat telescope, demonstrating its validity for engineering implementation. This theory may not only benefit optical imaging but also interferometry-based measurements, by providing an exceptional capability to simplify the interferometric output generated by a system of many apertures.

    "abstract": "Ultra-high-Q optical resonators have facilitated recent advancements in on-chip photonics by effectively harnessing nonlinear phenomena providing useful functionalities. While these breakthroughs, primarily focused on the near-infrared region, have extended interest to longer wavelengths holding importance for monitoring and manipulating molecules, the absence of ultra-high-Q resonators in this region remains a significant challenge. Here, we have developed on-chip microresonators with a remarkable Q-factor of 38 million, surpassing previous mid-infrared records by over 30 times. Employing innovative fabrication techniques, including the spontaneous formation of light-guiding geometries during material deposition, resonators with internal multilayer structures have been seamlessly created and passivated with chalcogenide glasses within a single chamber. Major loss factors, especially airborne-chemical absorption, were thoroughly investigated and mitigated by extensive optimization of resonator geometries and fabrication procedures. This allowed us to access the fundamental loss performance offered by doubly purified chalcogenide glass sources, as demonstrated in their fiber form. Exploiting this ultra-high-Q resonator, we successfully demonstrated Brillouin lasing on a chip for the first time in the mid-infrared, with a threshold power of 91.9 {\\mu}W and a theoretical Schawlow-Townes linewidth of 83.45 Hz, far surpassing carrier phase noise. Our results showcase the effective integration of cavity-enhanced optical nonlinearities into on-chip mid-infrared photonics. ",

    "abstract": "We report on the modeling and experimental characterization of Si CMOS detectors of terahertz radiation based on antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs). The detectors are manufactured using TSMC's 65-nm technology. We apply two models -- the TSMC RF foundry model and our own ADS-HDM -- to simulate the Si CMOS TeraFET performance and compare their predictions with respective experimental data. Both models are implemented in the commercial circuit simulation software Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS). We find that the compact model TSMC RF is capable to predict the detector responsivity and its dependence on frequency and gate voltage with good accuracy up to the highest frequency of 1.2 THz covered in this study. This frequency is well beyond the tool's intended operation range for 5G communications and 110-GHz millimeter wave applications. We demonstrate that our self-developed physics-based ADS-HDM tool, which relies on an extended one-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model and can be adapted readily to other material technologies, has high predictive qualities comparable to those of the foundry model. We use the ADS-HDM to discuss the contribution of diffusive and plasmonic effects to the THz response of Si CMOS TeraFETs, finding that these effects, while becoming more significant with rising frequency, are never dominant. Finally, we estimate that the electrical NEP (perfect power coupling conditions) is on the order of 5 pW/$\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$ at room-temperature. ",

    "abstract": "The present study explores combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with standard optical diagnostics (such as time--integrated emission spectroscopy and imaging) to accurately predict operating conditions and assess the emission uniformity of a cylindrical surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). It is demonstrated that ML can be complementary with these optical diagnostics and identify peculiarities associated with the discharge emission pattern at different high voltage waveforms (AC and pulsed) and amplitudes. By employing unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks) algorithms, the applied voltage waveform and amplitude are categorised and predicted based on correlations/differences identified within large amounts of corresponding data. PCA allowed us to effectively classify the voltage waveforms and amplitudes applied to the SDBD through a transformation of the spectroscopic/imaging data into principal components (PCs) and their projection to a two-dimensional PC space. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of the voltage amplitude is achieved using the MLP which is trained with PCA--preprocessed data. A particularly interesting aspect of this concept involves examining the uniformity of the emission pattern of the discharge. This is achieved by analysing spectroscopic data recorded at four different regions around the SDBD surface using the two ML--based techniques. These discoveries are instrumental in enhancing plasma--induced processes. They open up new avenues for real--time control, monitoring, and optimization of plasma--based applications across diverse fields such as flow control for the present SDBD. ",

It proves that the mechanical nano-oscillator is an extremely promising candidate for precision pressure sensing applications.

By highlighting the role of the polarization field in reshaping the spin-orbit coupling deduced from the Dirac quantum mechanics, we reveal in this work the characteristics and underlying mechanism in the relatively simpler OEC evolutions within the states S0 - S2 prior to the water oxidation. The characteristic shifts of the density of states (DOS) of the electron donor Mn atom are observed in the vicinity of the Fermi surface to occur with the spin flips of Mn atoms and the change of the Mn oxidation states during the electron transfer. Notably, the spin flips of Mn atoms point to the resulting spin configuration of the next states. It is found that the electron transfer tend to stabilize the catalyst OEC itself, whereas the proton transfer pushes the evolution forward by preparing a new electron donor. Meanwhile, it shows that the Mn-O bonds around the candidate Mn atom of the electron donor undergo characteristic changes in the bond lengths during the electron transfer. These concomitant phenomena uncovered in first-principle calculations characterize the essential equilibrium of the OEC between the state evolution and stability that forms a ground of the dynamic OEC cycles.

In this work, we resolve these issues by demonstrating a photonic next-generation reservoir computer (NG-RC) using a fiber optic platform. Our photonic NG-RC eliminates the need for a cavity by generating feature vectors directly from nonlinear combinations of the input data with varying delays. Our approach uses Rayleigh backscattering to produce output feature vectors by an unconventional nonlinearity resulting from coherent, interferometric mixing followed by a quadratic readout. Performing linear optimization on these feature vectors, our photonic NG-RC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for the observer (cross-prediction) task applied to the R\\\"ossler, Lorenz, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems. In contrast to digital NG-RC implementations, this scheme is easily scalable to high-dimensional systems while maintaining low latency and low power consumption. ",
