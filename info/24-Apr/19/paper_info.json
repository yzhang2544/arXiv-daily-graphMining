    "abstract": "Non-contact measurement of the refractive index and thickness of multilayer biological tissues is of great significance for biomedical applications and can greatly improve medical diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we introduce a theoretical method to simultaneously extract the above information using a Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) system, in which no additional arrangement and prior information about the object is required other than the OCT interference spectrum. The single reflection components can be extracted from the observed spectrum by isolating the primary spikes in the sample reflectance profile, and then the refractive index and thickness can be obtained by fitting the actual and modeled values of the single reflection spectrum. In a two-layer sample example, the simulation results show that our method can reconstruct the results with high accuracy. The relative error is within 0.01%. The complexity of our approach grows linearly with the number of sample layers, making it well-adapted to multilayer situations. Our method takes into account both single and multiple reflections in multilayer samples and is therefore equally applicable to samples with high refractive index contrast. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum chemical simulations can be greatly accelerated by constructing machine learning potentials, which is often done using active learning (AL). The usefulness of the constructed potentials is often limited by the high effort required and their insufficient robustness in the simulations. Here we introduce the end-to-end AL for constructing robust data-efficient potentials with affordable investment of time and resources and minimum human interference. Our AL protocol is based on the physics-informed sampling of training points, automatic selection of initial data, and uncertainty quantification. The versatility of this protocol is shown in our implementation of quasi-classical molecular dynamics for simulating vibrational spectra, conformer search of a key biochemical molecule, and time-resolved mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction. These investigations took us days instead of weeks of pure quantum chemical calculations on a high-performance computing cluster. ",

    "abstract": "Two-color laser induced plasma filamentation in air could serve as tabletop sources of broadband terahertz (THz) pulses. Ubiquitous air in the earth facilitates its widespread utilities, particularly, in wireless communication and remote sensing, exploiting the unique advantage of the air-based scheme that the THz sources can be delivered over standoff distances via the pump laser propagation in air. However, the THz emission pattern inevitably has a conical angular profile with a dip in the propagation axis, therefore, THz energy concentration, propagation directionality, and accuracy of signal demodulation are significantly impaired, greatly limiting its direct applications. Here, we successfully eliminate the unfavorable conical profile by experiments and meanwhile enhance THz directionality and intensity by 17 folds by use of abruptly-autofocusing laser beams. Our theory and simulations show that these observations are attributed to efficient suppression of the dephasing effect appearing in previous investigations with ordinary Gaussian laser beams. This scheme is easily accessible since the abruptly-autofocusing beam can be achieved by imposing a spatial light modulator on the input Gaussian beam. This study solves a long-standing problem in the two-color laser scheme and clarifies the underlying physics of the conical angular profile formation. ",

Here, we apply efficient integrated heaters to tune the idler frequency produced by Kerr optical parametric oscillation in a silicon-nitride microring across a continuous 1.5 terahertz range. Finally, we suppress idler frequency noise between DC and 5 kHz by several orders of magnitude using feedback to the heater drive. ",

Recent experiments (Chem. Eur. J. 2023, e202203513) have revealed oscillatory behavior between PCR efficiency and the concentration of gold nanoparticles in the pM range, potentially linked to the long-range Coulomb interactions among charged colloidal particles and the quantum size effect of nanoparticle electronic states. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that the radial distribution function of gold nanoparticles in solution gradually exhibits peak characteristics with increasing charge, triggering coherent photon behavior in Rayleigh scattering within the solution, thereby influencing the efficiency of reusing released photons in the PCR chain reaction. The study demonstrates that the oscillation period aligns with the wavelength of downstream reaction photons, while their energy matches the width of energy levels near the Fermi level of gold nanoparticles. The latter can absorb and store electron states internally, promoting upstream PCR reactions through subsequent re-release, and compensating for energy deficiencies through the Boltzmann distribution of electrons. This work is poised to advance the application of PCR-specific precise detection methods in the field of quantum biotechnology. ",

    "abstract": "Dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) with few-GHz tooth spacing that provides the optimal trade-off between spectral resolution and refresh rate is a powerful tool for measuring and analyzing rapidly evolving transient events. Despite such an exciting opportunity, existing technologies compromise either the spectral resolution or refresh rate, leaving few-GHz DCS with robust design largely unmet for frontier applications. In this work, we demonstrate a novel GHz DCS by exploring the multimode interference-mediated spectral filtering effect in an all-fiber ultrashort cavity configuration. The GHz single-cavity all-fiber dual-comb source is seeded by a dual-wavelength mode-locked fiber laser operating at fundamental repetition rates of about 1.0 GHz differing by 148 kHz, which has an excellent stability in the free-running state that the Allan deviation is only 101.7 mHz for an average time of 1 second. Thanks to the large repetition rate difference between the asynchronous dichromatic pulse trains, the GHz DCS enables a refresh time as short as 6.75 us, making it promising for studying nonrepeatable transient phenomena in real time. To this end, the practicality of the present GHz DCS is validated by successfully capturing the 'shock waves' of balloon and firecracker explosions outdoors. This GHz single-cavity all-fiber dual-comb system promises a noteworthy improvement in acquisition speed and reliability without sacrificing measurement accuracy, anticipated as a practical tool for high-speed applications.

Compared with electronic technology, photonic solutions are superior in bandwidth, but suffer from flexible and rapid manipulation of chirp shape.

It is realized on a simple fiber-optic platform involving a continuous-wave laser, a phase-modulated optical loop, low-speed electronics at MHz, and an optical coherent receiver. Microwave signals with bandwidths beyond tens of GHz, even up to hundreds of GHz, can be generated, where the chirp shape is identical to the low-frequency driving waveform of the phase-modulated optical loop. Besides, signal parameters, such as bandwidth, center frequency, and temporal duration, can be reconfigured in real time. In the experiment, highly-coherent microwave signals with various customized chirp shapes are generated, where the time resolution for programming the chirp shape is 649 ps. The center frequency and bandwidth tuning ranges exceed 21 GHz, and the temporal duration is tuned in the range of 9 ns to 180 ns. ",

Despite their similarities on account of their relationship with a circular state of polarization, SAM, helicity, and chirality emerge from distinct symmetries, which endows them with different physical meanings, properties, and practical applications. In this work, we investigate the behavior of such quantities in time-varying media (TVM), i.e., how a temporal modulation impacts their symmetries and conservation laws. Our results demonstrate that the SAM is conserved for any time modulation, helicity is only preserved in impedance-matched time modulations, while chirality is not conserved. In addition, the continuity equations highlight the dependence of the chirality with the energy content of the fields. These results provide additional insights into the similarities and differences between SAM, helicity, and chirality, as well as their physical meaning. Furthermore, our theoretical framework provides with a new perspective to analyze polarization-dependent light-matter interactions in TVM. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonics have led to a new generation of high-performance electro-optic devices, including modulators, frequency combs, and microwave-to-optical transducers. However, the broader adoption of TFLN-based devices that rely on all-optical nonlinearities have been limited by the sensitivity of quasi-phase matching (QPM), realized via ferroelectric poling, to fabrication tolerances. Here, we propose a scalable fabrication process aimed at improving the wavelength-accuracy of optical frequency mixers in TFLN. In contrast to the conventional pole-before-etch approach, we first define the waveguide in TFLN and then perform ferroelectric poling. This sequence allows for precise metrology before and after waveguide definition to fully capture the geometry imperfections. Systematic errors can also be calibrated by measuring a subset of devices to fine-tune the QPM design for remaining devices on the wafer. Using this method, we fabricated a large number of second harmonic generation devices aimed at generating 737 nm light, with 73% operating within 5 nm of the target wavelength. Furthermore, we also demonstrate thermo-optic tuning and trimming of the devices via cladding deposition, with the former bringing ~96% of tested devices to the target wavelength. Our technique enables the rapid growth of integrated quantum frequency converters, photon pair sources, and optical parametric amplifiers, thus facilitating the integration of TFLN-based nonlinear frequency mixers into more complex and functional photonic systems.

How to seed a crystalline in time domain is an open question, which is of great significant and may provide an avenue to understand and control time-dependent quantum many-body physics. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce the formation of a discrete time crystal in Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded crystalline order in subspace, which triggers the time-translation symmetry breaking across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent time crystal is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase dependent seeding and corresponding shift in periodicity of the time crystal, leading to embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insights into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding. ",
