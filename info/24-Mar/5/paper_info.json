In this work we develop a formalism to describe the cavity mediated energy exchange between a material and its electromagnetic environment. We show that coplanar cavities can significantly affect the heat load on the sample if the cavity resonance lies within the frequency region where free-space radiative heat dominates, typically the mid-IR at ambient temperature, while spectral filtering is necessary for having an effect with lower frequency cavities.

    "abstract": "Even when the partial differential equation underlying a physical process can be evolved forward in time, the retrospective (backward in time) inverse problem often has its own challenges and applications. Direct Adjoint Looping (DAL) is the defacto approach for solving retrospective inverse problems, but it has not been applied to deterministic retrospective Navier--Stokes inverse problems in 2D or 3D. In this paper, we demonstrate that DAL is ill-suited for solving retrospective 2D Navier--Stokes inverse problems. Alongside DAL, we study two other iterative methods: Simple Backward Integration (SBI) and the Quasi-Reversible Method (QRM). Our iterative SBI approach is novel while iterative QRM has previously been used. Using these three iterative methods, we solve two retrospective inverse problems: 1D Korteweg--de Vries--Burgers (decaying nonlinear wave) and 2D Navier--Stokes (unstratified Kelvin--Helmholtz vortex). In both cases, SBI and QRM reproduce the target final states more accurately and in fewer iterations than DAL. We attribute this performance gap to additional terms present in SBI and QRM's respective backward integrations which are absent in DAL. ",

    "abstract": "The remarkable frequency stability of resonant systems in the optical domain (optical cavities and atomic transitions) can be harnessed at frequency scales accessible by electronics using optical frequency division. This capability is revolutionizing technologies spanning time keeping to high-performance electrical signal sources. A version of the technique called 2-point optical frequency division (2P-OFD) is proving advantageous for application to high-performance signal sources. In 2P-OFD, an optical cavity anchors two spectral endpoints defined by lines of a frequency comb. The comb need not be self-referenced, which greatly simplifies the system architecture and reduces power requirements. Here, a 2P-OFD microwave signal source is demonstrated with record-low phase noise using a microcomb. Key to this advance is a spectral endpoint defined by a frequency agile single-mode dispersive wave that is emitted by the microcomb soliton. Moreover, the system frequency reference is a compact all-solid-state optical cavity with a record Q-factor. The results advance integrable microcomb-based signal sources into the performance realm of much larger microwave sources. ",

Here, we develop a quantum theory for STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects.

    "abstract": "Dissipative Kerr solitons from optical microresonators, commonly referred to as soliton microcombs, have been developed for a broad range of applications, including precision measurement, optical frequency synthesis, and ultra-stable microwave and millimeter wave generation, all on a chip. An important goal for microcombs is self referencing, which requires octave-spanning bandwidths to detect and stabilize the comb carrier envelope offset frequency. Further, detection and locking of the comb spacings are often achieved using frequency division by electro-optic modulation. The thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, with its low loss, strong second-order nonlinearity, and large Pockels effect, is ideally suited for these tasks. However, octave-spanning soliton microcombs are challenging to demonstrate on this platform, largely complicated by strong Raman effects hindering reliable fabrication of soliton devices. Here, we demonstrate entirely connected and octave-spanning soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate. With appropriate control over microresonator free spectral range and dissipation spectrum, we show that soliton-inhibiting Raman effects are suppressed, and soliton devices are fabricated with near-unity yield. Our work offers an unambiguous method for soliton generation on strongly Raman-active materials. Further, it anticipates monolithically integrated, self-referenced frequency standards in conjunction with established technologies, such as periodically poled waveguides and electro-optic modulators, on thin-film lithium niobate.

In contrast, transition-edge sensors (TES) have intrinsic energy sensitivity and so do not require prior filtering to perform energy-resolved measurements. Despite this fundamental advantage, TES electron spectroscopy has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported in the literature. We present the results of a set of proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating TES electron spectroscopy experiments using Mo/Au TESs repurposed for electron calorimetry. Using these detectors, we successfully measured the electron spectrum generated by an electron beam striking a graphite target with energies between 750 and 2000 eV, at a noise-limited energy resolution of 4 eV. Based on the findings of these experiments, we suggest improvements that could be made to TES design to enhance their electron detection capabilities through the use of of a dedicated electron absorber in the device with integrated electron optics.

Therefore, we demonstrate a frequency-stabilized and precisely tunable laser system based on it. In this scheme, the laser frequency locked to the OFC is driven to jump over the ambiguity zones, which blocks the wide tuning of the locked laser, and tuned until the mode hopping happens with the always-activated feedback loop. Meanwhile, we compensate the gap of the frequency jump with a synchronized acoustic optical modulator to ensure the continuity. This scheme is applied to an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) and we achieve tuning at a rate of about 7 GHz/s with some readily available commercial electronics. Furthermore, we tune the frequency-stabilized laser only with the feedback of diode current and its average tuning speed can exceed 100 GHz/s. Due to the resource-efficient configuration and the simplicity of completion, this scheme can be referenced and find wide applications in AMO experiments. ",

The integration of GaSe shifts the dispersion bands of the PC waveguide mode into the bandgap, resulting in localized modes confined by the bare PC waveguides. Thanks to the small contrast of refractive index at the boundaries of microcavity, it is reliably to obtain quality (Q) factors exceeding 10^4. With the enhanced light-GaSe interaction by the microcavity modes and high second-order nonlinearity of GaSe, remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) are achieved. A record-high on-chip SHG conversion efficiency of 131100% W^-1 is obtained, enabling the clear SHG imaging of the resonant modes with the pump of sub-milliwatts continuous-wave (CW) laser. Driven by a pump of on-resonance CW laser, strong SFGs are successfully carried out with the other pump of a CW laser spanning over the broad telecom-band. Broadband frequency conversion of an incoherent superluminescent light-emitting diode with low spectral power density is also realized in the integrated GaSe-PC waveguide.

Imaging the gel through the transparent PDMS with a color camera provides a direct, easy, and contact-free determination of the fluid pressure at the sensing location for pressures as small as \\SI{20}{\\milli\\bar} with a resolution of around \\SI{10}{\\milli\\bar}. The sensitivity and accessible pressure range can be tuned via the mechanical properties \\RE{of the sensing unit}. The photonic gel can also be used to acquire 2D pressure or deformation maps, taking advantage of the fast response time and fine spatial resolution. ",

    "abstract": "These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the \"energy center\" and \"probability center\" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties. ",

    "abstract": "Tailored light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry. While strong light-matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly-excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, due to the lack of pulse shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach unravels the strong-field induced bound-continuum coupling of the electronic states in helium and enables substantial suppression of the ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time ",

    "abstract": "Measuring low light absorption with combined uncertainty < 1 permille is crucial in a wide range of applications. Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultra-high precision, below 0.01 permille, but its accuracy is strongly dependent on the measurement capabilities of the detection system and typically is about 10 permille. Here, we exploit the optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field, not explored in conventional CRDS, for high-fidelity spectroscopy. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. This approach is insensitive to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements and eliminates the problem of detector band nonlinearity, the main cause of measurement error in traditional CRDS. Using the CO and HD line intensities as examples, we demonstrate the sub-permille accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10^(-4) level. Such results have not been achieved in optical spectroscopy before. The high accuracy of the presented method indicates its potential in atmospheric studies, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and the establishment of primary gas standards. ",

    "abstract": "People with injuries to the peripheral nervous system, due to its poor functional regeneration, suffer from paralysis of the facial muscles, fingers and hands, or toes and feet, often for the rest of their lives. Therefore, to improve patients' quality of life, there is an urgent need for conduits that effectively support the healing of large defects in nerve pathways through specific guidance of nerve cells. This paper describes two specific methods for achieving directed growth of Schwann cells, a type of glial cells that can support the regeneration of the nerve pathway by guiding the neuronal axons in the direction of their alignment. One method implies the exposure of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) foil to a KrF* laser beam, that renders a nanorippled surface topography. The other method uses aligned polyamide-6 (PA-6) nanofibers produced via electrospinning on a very fast rotating structured collector, which enables easy nanofiber detachment, without additional effort. Schwann cells growth on these substrates was inspected after one week of cultivation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM). For both methods we show that Schwann cells grow in a certain direction, predetermined by nanoripples and nanofibers orientation. In contrast, cells cultivated onto unstructured surfaces or randomly oriented nanofibers, show an omnidirectional growth behavior. ",

We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source. ",

This paper presents a simple, compact, and cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available. Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects. ",

    "abstract": "Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls. ",

We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, CNN outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification.
