    "title": "Inverse Design of Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers is a Sequence  Modeling Problem",
    "abstract": "Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL)'s inverse design demands expert knowledge in physics, materials science, and quantum mechanics which is prohibitively labor-intensive. Advanced AI technologies, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have emerged as a powerful tool to augment and accelerate this inverse design process. By modeling the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequential decision-making problem, RL approaches can construct a satisfactory PCSEL structure from scratch. However, the data inefficiency resulting from online interactions with precise and expensive simulation environments impedes the broader applicability of RL approaches. Recently, sequential models, especially the Transformer architecture, have exhibited compelling performance in sequential decision-making problems due to their simplicity and scalability to large language models. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework named PCSEL Inverse Design Transformer (PiT) that abstracts the inverse design of PCSEL as a sequence modeling problem. The central part of our PiT is a Transformer-based structure that leverages the past trajectories and current states to predict the current actions. Compared with the traditional RL approaches, PiT can output the optimal actions and achieve target PCSEL designs by leveraging offline data and conditioning on the desired return. Results demonstrate that PiT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines. ",

    "title": "Quantum embedding for molecules using auxiliary particles -- The ghost  Gutzwiller Ansatz",
    "abstract": "Strong/static electronic correlation mediates the emergence of remarkable phases of matter, and underlies the exceptional reactivity properties in transition metal-based catalysts. Modeling strongly correlated molecules and solids calls for multi-reference Ans\\\"atze, which explicitly capture the competition of energy scales characteristic of such systems. With the efficient computational screening of correlated solids in mind, the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) Ansatz has been recently developed. This is a variational Ansatz which can be formulated as a self-consistent embedding approach, describing the system within a non-interacting, quasiparticle model, yet providing with accurate spectra in both low and high energy regimes. Crucially, small fragments of the system are identified as responsible for the strong correlation, and are therefore enhanced by adding a set of auxiliary orbitals, the ghosts. These capture many-body correlations through one-body fluctuations and subsequent out-projection when computing physical observables. gGut has been shown to accurately describe multi-orbital lattice models at modest computational cost. In this work, we extend the gGut framework to strongly correlated molecules. To adapt the gGut Ansatz for molecular calculations, we address the fact that, unlike in the lattice model previously considered, electronic interactions in molecules are not local. Hence, we explore a hierarchy of approximations of increasing accuracy capturing interactions between fragments and environment, and within the environment, and discuss how these affect the embedding description of correlations in the whole molecule. We will compare the accuracy of the gGut model with established methods to capture strong correlation within active space formulations, and assess the realistic use of this novel approximation to the theoretical description of correlated molecular clusters.

    "abstract": "Photonic structures with Weyl points (WPs), including type-I and type-II, promise nontrivial surface modes and intriguing light manipulations for their three-dimensional topological bands. While previous studies mainly focus on exploring WPs in a uniform Weyl structure, here we establish Weyl heterostructures (i.e., a nonuniform Weyl lattice) with different rotational orientations in the synthetic dimension by nanostructured photonic waveguides. In this work, we unveil a transition between bound and extended modes on the interface of type-II Weyl heterostructures by tuning their rotational phases, despite the reversed topological order across the interface. This mode transition is also manifested from the total transmission to total reflection at the interface. All of these unconventional effects are attributed to the tilted dispersion of type-II Weyl band structure that can lead to mismatched bands and gaps across the interface. As a comparison, the type-I Weyl heterostructures lack the phase transition due to the untilted band structure. This work establishes a flexible scheme of artificial Weyl heterostructures that opens a new avenue towards high-dimensional topological effects and significantly enhances our capabilities in on-chip light manipulations.

    "abstract": "The rapid development in Rydberg-atomic detection of microwave fields has paved the way to a new type of intrinsically calibrated RF measurements. The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g.~weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining most of the sensitivity. We tackle the issue of uncorrelated laser phase, emerging in this type of detection, by facilitating separate measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and using the results in post-processing. We report the sensitivity of $176\\ \\mathrm{nV/cm/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\\ \\mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\\ \\mathrm{GHz}$ electric field, while comparing with the state of the art (although not all-optical) method realized in the same setup.

From simulated time-resolved diffraction data, we retrieve the evolving density matrix in a crude diabatic representation basis and reveal the symmetry of the excited pyrrole wavepacket.

We derive algebraic expressions for magnetometry signals based on multipole moments description. Experiments are carried out using a room-temperature paraffin-coated Caesium vapour cell and measuring either the polarization rotation or absorption of the transmitted laser light. A detailed experimental analysis of the resonance spectra is performed to validate the theoretical findings for various input parameters. The results signify the use of a single isotropic relaxation rate thus simplifying the data analysis for optimization of the DRAM. The sensitivity measurements are performed and reveal that the polarization rotation detection mode yields larger signals and better sensitivity than absorption measurement of light. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent of exascale computing, effective load balancing in massively parallel software applications is critically important for leveraging the full potential of high performance computing systems. Load balancing is the distribution of computational work between available processors. Here, we investigate the application of quantum annealing to load balance two paradigmatic algorithms in high performance computing. Namely, adaptive mesh refinement and smoothed particle hydrodynamics are chosen as representative grid and off-grid target applications. While the methodology for obtaining real simulation data to partition is application specific, the proposed balancing protocol itself remains completely general. In a grid based context, quantum annealing is found to outperform classical methods such as the round robin protocol but lacks a decisive advantage over more advanced methods such as steepest descent or simulated annealing despite remaining competitive. The primary obstacle to scalability is found to be limited coupling on current quantum annealing hardware. However, for the more complex particle formulation, approached as a multi-objective optimization, quantum annealing solutions are demonstrably Pareto dominant to state of the art classical methods across both objectives. This signals a noteworthy advancement in solution quality which can have a large impact on effective CPU usage. ",

However, despite many emerging successful applications, the discussion about intrinsic quantum effects has mainly been ignored. In this Perspective, we explore the latest advancements in quantum phenomena within attosecond science, encompassing both experimental and theoretical progress. Specifically, in the context of high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization, we focus on discerning genuinely quantum observations and distinguishing them from classical phenomena. Additionally, we illuminate the often overlooked yet significant role of entanglement in attosecond processes, elucidating its influence on experimental outcomes. ",
