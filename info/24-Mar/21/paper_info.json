    "abstract": "A non-separable wave-like integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the Wigner distribution function in phase space is educed from the corresponding separable kinetic equation. It is shown that it leads to non-local dispersion effects that may involve complex group velocities and also display non-unitary features as entropy production. By employing the quantum hydrodynamical description a non-local evolution wave equation is also derived by synthesizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with that of continuity, which predicts the generation of quadrupole quantum effects in the propagation of the spatial probability density. Extension of the formalism for a boson scalar field is also presented along with a brief commentary on the issue of irreversibility. ",

    "abstract": "Microwave photonic (MWP) signal processors, which process microwave signals based on pho-tonic technologies, bring advantages intrinsic to photonics such as low loss, large processing bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Optical microcombs can offer a large number of wavelength channels and compact device footprints, which make them powerful multi-wavelength sources for MWP signal processors to realize a variety of processing functions. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the capability of microcomb-based MWP signal processors to handle diverse input signal waveforms. In addition, we quantify the processing accuracy for different input signal waveforms, including Gaussian, triangle, parabolic, super Gaussian, and nearly square waveforms. Finally, we analyze the factors contributing to the dif-ference in the processing accuracy among the different input waveforms, and our theoretical analysis well elucidates the experimental results. These results provide a guidance for micro-comb-based MWP signal processors when processing microwave signals of various waveforms. ",

    "abstract": "Development of small pixels for high resolution image sensors implies a lot of challenges. A high level of performance should be guaranteed whereas the overall size must be reduced and so the degree of freedom in design and process. One key parameter of this constant improvement is the knowledge and the control of the crosstalk between pixels. In this paper, we present an advance in crosstalk characterization method based on the design of specific color patterns and the measurement of quantum efficiency. In a first part, we describe the color patterns designed to isolate one pixel or to simulate un-patterned colored pixels. These patterns have been implemented on test-chip and characterized. The second part deals with the characterization setup for quantum efficiency. Indeed, the use of spectral measurements allows us to discriminate pixels based on the color filter placed on top of them and to probe the crosstalk as a function of the depth in silicon, thanks to the photon absorption length variation with the wavelength. In the last part, results are presented showing the impact of color filters patterning, i.e. pixels in a Bayer pattern versus un-patterned pixels. The crosstalk directions and amplitudes are also analyzed in relation to pixel layout. ",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is of great interest in life science studies for visualizing subcellular structures at the nanometer scale. Among various kinds of super-resolution approaches, image scanning microscopy (ISM) offers a doubled resolution enhancement in a simple and straightforward manner, based on the commonly used confocal microscopes. ISM is also suitable to be integrated with multi-photon microscopy techniques, such as two-photon excitation and second-harmonic generation imaging, for deep tissue imaging, but it remains the twofold limited resolution enhancement and requires expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate the super-linear ISM (SL-ISM) to push the resolution enhancement beyond the factor of two, with a single low-power, continuous-wave, and near-infrared laser, by harnessing the emission nonlinearity within the multiphoton excitation process of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Based on a modified confocal microscope, we achieve a resolution of about 120 nm, 1/8th of the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, we demonstrate a parallel detection strategy of SL-ISM with the multifocal structured excitation pattern, to speed up the acquisition frame rate. This method suggests a new perspective for super-resolution imaging or sensing, multi-photon imaging, and deep-tissue imaging with simple, low-cost, and straightforward implementations. ",

In this study, a four-step phase-shifting interferometer is developed to measure the spatio-temporal distribution of acoustic density oscillations of the gas next to a rigid plate. The experimental apparatus consists of a polarizing Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a polarization camera capable of capturing four polarization directions in one shot image and it is used to measure the magnitude and the phase of density fluctuations through a duct of rectangular cross-section connected to a loudspeaker. The results are compared with the well-established thermoacoustic theory describing the thermal coupling between acoustic oscillations and rigid boundaries, and the results show a very good agreement for various ratios of the (frequency-dependent) thermal boundary layer thickness to the plate spacing. This measurement technique could be advantageously employed to analyze more complex heat transfer processes involving the coupling of acoustic oscillations with rigid boundaries. ",

Expressions for the sensitivity of two detection schemes are derived: 1) a dispersive spectrometer, and 2) a direct-conversion/homodyne receiver using detectors as mixing elements. In both cases the semi-classical/Poisson-mixture approach is used to account for quantum effects. Preliminary sensitivity calculations are performed to guide future development work. These suggest the homodyne scheme offers a near-term solution for realising near-quantum-noise limited receivers with improved usability compared with parametric amplifiers. Similarly, they show that the dispersive spectrometer offers a potential way to beat the quantum noise limit, but that significant technological development work is needed to do so. ",

We quantify the entanglement in terms of concurrence. Additionally, we study the radiance behaviour in the presence of an intracavity Kerr-nonlinear medium that leads to two-photon blockade.

    "abstract": "Classically defined optical phase sensitivity is known as the shot-noise limit (SNL) or standard quantum limit originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase resolution (sensitivity) is inversely proportional to the square root N, where N is the number of interfering photons or individually measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous due to the square root N gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In an optical interferometer, however, the phase resolution remains in the N=1 case unless N probe photons are resolved in a detection process, resulting in the diffraction limit of classical optics. Here, a projective measurement is proposed for intensity product-based optical sensing to realize SNL in a typical interferometer commonly used for high-precision metrology. For this, one of the output ports of the interferometer is evenly divided into N ports and measured them for mth-intensity correlations (m is less than or equal to N), where the maximum N is given by the total number of photons of the input laser. The maximum temporal delay among N photons is constrained by the spectral bandwidth of the laser, which is the same as the effective coherence time of the photon ensemble used for coincidence detection-based quantum sensing.

    "abstract": "Integrating light emitters based on III-V materials with silicon-based electronics is crucial for further increase in data transfer rates in communication systems since the indirect bandgap of silicon prevents its direct use as a light source. We investigate here InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown directly on 5{\\deg} off-cut Si substrate and emitting light at 1.5 micrometers, compatible with established telecom platform. Using different dislocation defects filtering layers, exploiting strained superlattices and supplementary QD layers, we mitigate the effects of lattice constant and thermal expansion mismatches between III-V materials and Si during growth. Complementary optical spectroscopy techniques, i.e. photoreflectance and temperature-, time- and polarization- resolved photoluminescence, allow us to determine the optical quality and application potential of the obtained structures by comparing them to a reference sample -- state-of-the-art QDs grown on InP. Experimental findings are supported by calculations of excitonic states and optical transitions by combining multiband k.p and configuration-interaction methods. We show that our design of structures prevents the generation of a considerable density of defects, as intended. The emission of Si-based structures appears to be much broader than for the reference dots, due to the creation of different QD populations which might be a disadvantage in particular laser applications, however, could be favourable for others, e.g. in broadly tunable devices, sensors, or optical amplifiers. Eventually, we identify the overall most promising combination of defect filtering layers, discuss its advantages and limitations, and prospects for further improvements. ",
