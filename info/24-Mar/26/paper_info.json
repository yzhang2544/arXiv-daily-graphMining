    "abstract": "More recently, the ALPHA-g experiment has shown that antiatoms fall in the Earth's gravitational field like ordinary atoms, with the open possibility that antiatoms fall with a slightly lower acceleration. A possible lower acceleration of antiatoms (which could be revealed with two orders of magnitude higher precision measurements) would be an epoch-making discovery and a window to a new physics, suggesting among other things that quarks and antiquarks have gravitational charges of opposite sign. If gravitational charges of opposite sign exist, it implies the existence of virtual gravitational dipoles in the quantum vacuum, and opens up the possibility of including the quantum vacuum as an important source of gravity in the Universe.

    "abstract": "Non-thermal molecular plasmas play a crucial role in numerous industrial processes and hold significant potential for driving essential chemical transformations. Accurate information about the molecular composition of the plasmas and the distribution of populations among quantum states is essential for understanding and optimizing plasma processes. Here, we apply a mid-infrared frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer to measure high-resolution spectra of plasmas containing hydrogen, nitrogen, and a carbon source in the 2800 - 3400 cm$^{-1}$ range. The spectrally broadband and high-resolution capabilities of this technique enable quantum-state-resolved spectroscopy of multiple plasma-generated species simultaneously, including CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, C$_2$H$_6$, NH$_3$, and HCN, providing detailed information beyond the limitations of current methods. Using a line-by-line fitting approach, we analyzed 548 resolved transitions across five vibrational bands of plasma-generated HCN. The results indicate a significant non-thermal distribution of the populations among the quantum states, with distinct temperatures observed for lower and higher rotational quantum numbers, with a temperature difference of about 62 K. Broadband state-resolved-spectroscopy via comb-based methods provides unprecedented fundamental insights into the non-thermal nature of molecular plasmas - a detailed picture that has never been accomplished before for such complex non-thermal environment.

However, state-of-the-art solutions typically present trade-offs in terms of loss, bandwidth, and fabrication robustness, especially when targeting multimode operation. Here, we present a novel multimode 3-dB power splitter based on a symmetric Y-junction assisted by subwavelength grating metamaterials. The inclusion of the metamaterial structure circumvents the practical limitations of conventional Y-junction tips and realizes smooth modal transitions. Simulations for a standard 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator platform predict minimal excess loss (< 0.2 dB) for the fundamental and the first-order transverse-electric modes over an ultra-broad 700 nm bandwidth (1300-2000 nm). For the fundamental transverse-magnetic mode, losses are less than 0.3 dB in the 1300-1800 nm range. Experimental measurements validate these predictions in the 1430-1630 nm wavelength range, demonstrating losses < 0.4 dB for all three modes, even in the presence of fabrication deviations of up to \\pm 10 nm. We believe that this device is suitable for the implementation of advanced photonic systems requiring high-performance distribution of optical signals. ",

    "abstract": "Free electrons are unique tools to probe and manipulate nanoscale optical fields with emerging applications in ultrafast spectromicroscopy and quantum metrology. However, advances in this field are hindered by the small probability associated with the excitation of single optical modes by individual free electrons. Here, we theoretically investigate the scaling properties of the electron-driven excitation probability for a wide variety of optical modes including plasmons in metallic nanostructures and Mie resonances in dielectric cavities, spanning a broad spectral range that extends from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The highest probabilities for the direct generation of three-dimensionally confined modes are observed at low electron and mode energies in small structures, with order-unity ($\\sim100$\\%) coupling demanding the use of $<100$~eV electrons interacting with $<1$~eV polaritons confined down to tens of nm. Electronic transitions in artificial atoms also emerge as practical systems to realize strong coupling to few-eV free electrons. In contrast, conventional dielectric cavities reach a maximum probability in the few-percent range. In addition, we show that waveguide modes can be generated with higher-than-unity efficiency by phase-matched interaction with grazing electrons, suggesting an efficient method to create multiple excitations of a localized optical mode by an individual electron through funneling the so-generated propagating photons into a confining cavity -- an alternative approach to direct electron-cavity interaction. Our work provides a roadmap to optimize electron-photon coupling with potential applications in electron spectromicroscopy as well as nonlinear and quantum optics at the nanoscale. ",

In the frequency domain, the closed-form least square solution matches the optimal time reversal solution for multiple emitter-receiver pairs, optimizing for each frequency independently. This is more efficient than solving in the time domain where the time convolution mixes all the degrees of freedom into a resource-intensive optimization. We illustrate this methodology by optimizing the frequency response of a design for two pairs of emitters-receivers using the Green's functions of disordered media that are measured experimentally. We report strong performance that will be put in perspective in future work, where we will analyze the robustness of the design to noise in the data and design the convolutional filters that match the optimal frequency response for experiment validation of the design.

This phenomenon involves modification of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the laser pulse due to the presence of the magnetized plasma. The discussion reveals how the electric field and electron velocity evolve within the plasma both spatially and temporally. Factors such as absorption, dispersion, collisions, and scattering are taken into account to understand how they influence the evolution of the pulse. The effects of electron density, external magnetic fields, relativistic velocities, and polarization states on pulse compression are examined. The spatial laser profile impact on pulse-shaping and plasma channel formation is also discussed.

    "abstract": "Image-guided navigation of catheter devices to anatomic targets within large 3D cardiac chambers and vessels is challenging in the interventional setting due to the limitations of a conventional 2D x-ray projection format. Scanning-beam digital x-ray (SBDX) is a low-dose inverse geometry x-ray fluoroscopy technology capable of real-time 3D catheter tracking. SBDX performs rapid tomosynthesis using an electronically scanned multisource x-ray tube and photon-counting detector mounted to a C-arm gantry. However, SBDX currently lacks the ability to perform volumetric computed tomography from a rotational C-arm scan. This work develops a novel volumetric CT capability for the SBDX platform, termed C-arm inverse geometry CT, suitable for rotational scans of the beating heart. The work is divided into three tasks: development of image reconstruction algorithms, implementation on the SBDX hardware, and performance assessment for the example task of 3D cardiac chamber mapping. SBDX-CT data acquisition is performed by simultaneous x-ray source scanning at 15 scan/s and C-arm rotation over a 190 degree short-scan arc in 13.4 seconds. An iterative reconstruction method was developed to accommodate fully truncated projections and data inconsistency resulting from cardiac motion during rotation. Hardware implementation included development of a C-arm angle measurement method, development of a geometric calibration method to account for non-ideal C-arm rotations, and detector response nonlinearity correction. The geometric calibration procedure mitigated artifacts from C-arm deflection during rotation. SBDX-CT image quality was evaluated in phantom studies. Feasibility of in-vivo SBDX-CT was demonstrated in a porcine model. ",

These are analogous to arrays of multivariate optical elements that could be used for sensing specific analytes. Spectral tailoring is achieved by engineering the heights of multiple sub-pixel Fabry-Perot resonators that cover each pixel area. We first present a design approach for hyperpixels, based on a matched filter concept and, as an exemplar, design a set of 4 hyperpixels tailored to optimally discriminate between 4 spectral reflectance targets. Next, we fabricate repeating 2x2 pixel filter arrays of these designs, alongside repeating 2x2 arrays of an optimal bandpass filters, perform both spectral and imaging characterization. Experimentally measured hyperpixel transmission spectra show a 2.4x reduction in unmixing matrix condition number (p=0.031) compared to the optimal band-pass set. Imaging experiments using the filter arrays with a monochrome sensor achieve a 3.47x reduction in unmixing matrix condition number (p=0.020) compared to the optimal band-pass set. This demonstrates the utility of the hyperpixel approach and shows its superiority even over the optimal bandpass case. We expect that with further improvements in design and fabrication processes increased performance may be obtained. Because the hyperpixels are straightforward to customize, fabricate and can be placed atop monochrome sensors, this approach is highly versatile and could be adapted to a wide range of real-time imaging applications which are limited by low SNR including micro-endoscopy, capsule endoscopy, industrial inspection and machine vision.

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the developments of self-assembled optical metasurfaces to overcome inherent limitations in polarization density (P) within natural materials, which hinder achieving high refractive indices (n) at optical frequencies. The Maxwellian macroscopic description establishes a link between P and n, revealing a static limit in natural materials, restricting n to approximately 4.0 at optical frequencies. Optical metasurfaces, utilizing metallic colloids on a deep-subwavelength scale, offer a solution by unnaturally enhancing n through electric dipolar (ED) resonances. Self-assembly enables the creation of nanometer-scale metallic gaps between metallic nanoparticles (NPs), paving the way for achieving exceptionally high n at optical frequencies. This study focuses on assembling polyhedral gold (Au) NPs into a closely packed monolayer by rationally designing the polymeric ligand to balance attractive and repulsive forces, in that polymeric brush-mediated self-assembly of the close-packed Au NP monolayer is robustly achieved over a large-area. The resulting monolayer of Au nanospheres (NSs), nanooctahedras (NOs), and nanocubes (NCs) exhibits high macroscopic integrity and crystallinity, sufficiently enough for pushing n to record-high regimes. The study underlies the significance of capacitive coupling in achieving an unnaturally high n and explores fine-tuning Au NC size to optimize this coupling. The achieved n of 10.12 at optical frequencies stands as a benchmark, highlighting the potential of polyhedral Au NPs in advancing optical metasurfaces. ",

Here, we provide a novel sensor design approach that employs metasurfaces to enable multifunctional sensing without requiring an external power source. Importantly, unlike existing metasurface-based sensors, our metasurfaces can sense multiple physical parameters even at a fixed frequency by breaking classic harmonic oscillations in the time domain, making the proposed sensors viable for usage with limited frequency resources. Moreover, we provide a method for predicting physical parameters using the machine learning-based approach of random forest regression. The sensing performance was confirmed by estimating temperature and light intensity, and excellent determination coefficients larger than 0.96 were achieved. Our study affords new opportunities for sensing multiple physical properties without relying on an external power source or needing multiple frequencies, which markedly simplifies and facilitates the design of next-generation wireless communication systems.

We trace this behavior in host-guest 2D silica to an interplay of tensile strain, rattling phonon modes, and redistribution of electrons. We also find that 4ph scatterings play indispensable roles in the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D silica.

We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.
