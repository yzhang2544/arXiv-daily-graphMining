    "title": "Surface variation analysis of freeform optical systems over surface  frequency bands for prescribed wavefront errors",
    "abstract": "The surface errors of freeform surfaces reflect the manufacturing complexities and significantly impact the feasibility of processing designed optical systems. With multiple degrees of freedom, freeform surfaces pose challenges in surface tolerance analysis in the field. Nevertheless, current research has neglected the influence of surface slopes on the directions of ray propagation. A sudden alteration in the surface slope will lead to a corresponding abrupt shift in the wavefront, even when the change in surface sag is minimal. Moreover, within the realm of freeform surface manufacturing, variation in surface slope across different frequency bands may give rise to unique surface variation. Within the context of this study, we propose a tolerance analysis method to analyze surface variation in freeform surfaces considering surface frequency band slopes based on real ray data. This approach utilizes real ray data to rapidly evaluate surface variation within a specified frequency band of surface slopes. Crucially, our proposed method yields the capability to obtain system surface variation with significant wavefront aberration, in contrast to previous methodologies. The feasibility and advantages of this framework are assessed by analyzing a single-mirror system with a single field and an off-axis two-mirror system. We expect to integrate the proposed methodology with freeform surface design and manufacturing, thereby expanding the scope of freeform optics. ",

    "abstract": "We present an overview on the development and characterization of multiscale laser processing optics for versatile material modifications across more than six orders of magnitude. Starting with solutions for micromachining we present high-NA microscope objectives creating sub-wavelength material modifications on macroscopic scales with highest peak intensities. Moving on to the millimeter range, the adaptability and scalability of scanning optics is examined for large-area machining. Finally, we explore line beam optics in the meter range, evaluating their use in uniform material processing using average powers above 100kW. This study provides an insight into the design and performance characteristics of such optics and demonstrates their potential in advanced laser processing. ",

    "title": "Theoretical analysis of chemical reactions using a variational quantum  eigensolver method without specifying molecular charge",
    "abstract": "Quantum chemical calculations have attracted much attention as a practical application of quantum computing. Quantum computers can prepare superpositions of electronic states with various numbers of electrons on qubits. This special feature could be used to construct an efficient method for analyzing the structural variations of molecules and chemical reactions involving changes in molecular charge. The present work demonstrates a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm based on a cost function ($L_{cost}$) having the same form as the grand potential of the grand canonical ensemble of electrons. The chemical potential of the electrons ($w$) is used as an input to these VQE calculations, whereas the molecular charge is not specified in advance but rather is a physical quantity that results from the calculations. Calculations involving model systems are carried out to show the viability of this new approach. Calculations for typical electron-donating and electron-accepting molecules using this technique yielded cationic, neutral or anionic species depending on the value of $w$. Models representing the adsorption of water or ammonia on copper-based catalysts predicted that oxidation would be associated with such adsorption. The molecular structures in which such reactions occurred were found to be dependent on the catalyst model, the adsorbed molecular species, and the value of $w$. These results arise because the electronic state that gives the lowest $L_{cost}$ value depends on the value of $w$ and the molecular structure. This behaviour was successfully simulated by the present VQE calculations. ",

    "abstract": "The physics of waves in time-varying media provides numerous opportunities for wave control that are unattainable with static media. In particular, Floquet systems with a periodic time modulation are currently of considerable interest. Here, we demonstrate how the scattering properties of a finite Floquet medium can be correctly described by a static Floquet scattering matrix, which satisfies a pseudo-unitary relation. This algebraic property is a consequence of the conservation of wave action for which we formulate here a continuity equation. Using this Floquet scattering matrix, we further demonstrate how it can be used to generalize also the seminal Wigner-Smith operator from static to Floquet systems. The eigenstates of the corresponding Floquet Wigner-Smith matrix are shown to be light pulses that are optimally shaped both in their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom for the optical micromanipulation of time-varying media.

    "abstract": "The previous research proves that the random laser emission reflects not only the scattering properties but also the absorption properties. The random laser is therefore considered a potential tool for optical properties sensing. Although the qualitative sensing using the random laser is extensively investigated, a quantitative measurement is still rare. In this study, a generalized mathematical quantitative model using random laser combined with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is proposed for optical sensing in turbid media. This model describes the gain effect of the active medium and the optical properties effect of the passive medium separately. Rhodamine 6G is used as the active medium. Intralipid and ink are employed to demonstrate the effect of the scattering and absorption, respectively. The peak wavelength shift of the random laser is proved to be an ideal sensing parameter for this sensing model. It is also revealed that the scaling parameters in the sensing model are interrelated and can be simplified to one. With this combined model, the direct sensing of optical properties in diverse turbid media is promising. ",

    "abstract": "Within the domain of optical frequency comb systems operating in the mid-infrared, extensive exploration has been undertaken regarding critical parameters such as stabilization, coherence, or spectral tunability. Despite this, certain essential parameters remain inadequately addressed, particularly concerning the light source prerequisites for advanced spectroscopy techniques operating in the 3-5 ${\\mu}$m spectral region. Specifically, the necessity for high simultaneous stability of average power, spectral shape, and temporal properties, alongside requirements for excellent beam quality and high powers of several Watts, emerges for applications like cavity-enhanced Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy. Existing systems fall short of meeting these rigorous criteria. This study delves into the metrology aspects of an optical parametric oscillator system, with a particular emphasis on its suitability for powerhungry metrology applications. Notably, the highest average power reported in the 3-5 ${\\mu}$m region, reaching 10.3W for the idler output at 3.1 ${\\mu}$m, is achieved. Additionally, new aspects, like the analysis of idler phase noise and beam quality and the onset of higher order modes are discussed. These findings represent a significant advancement towards the realization of highly-stable, metrologygrade frequency combs in the mid-infrared, thereby facilitating precision spectroscopy techniques previously constrained by light source average powers and quality limitations.

In centrosymmetric systems, even-order harmonics may arise, e.g., at surfaces but such effects are usually very weak. Here we observe optical harmonics up to 4-th order generated under the normal incidence from centrosymmetric dielectric metasurfaces empowered by resonances. We design silicon metasurfaces supporting optical quasibound states in the continuum and guided-mode resonances, and demonstrate the enhancement of second-harmonic signals by over three orders of magnitude compared to nonresonant thin films. Under the optimal conditions, the brightness of the second harmonic approaches that of the third harmonic, and the 4th-order harmonic becomes detectable. ",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical model of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage from high-power laser interactions with gas jets. As hot electrons are accelerated beyond the laser channel, they produce a positively-charged plasma that expands into the ambient gas until it reaches the gas jet nozzle. A strong plasma potential leads to electrical breakdown that ionises the gas even faster than the expanding plasma ions. When contact is made between the plasma and the conducting nozzle surface, a discharge current propagates to ground and an electromagnetic pulse is radiated via an antenna emission mechanism. Damage to gas jet nozzles is caused by heating from plasma ions rather than Ohmic heating via a discharge current. Our model agrees with experimental data from experiments on proton acceleration in near-critical plasmas at the Vulcan and VEGA-3 lasers. ",

The formalism is applicable to any linear quantum master equation supporting metastability for which absorbing boundary conditions designating the reactant and product states can be applied. We use this formalism to determine the dependence of the quantum transition state on coherences in a polaritonic system and optimize the initialization state of a conical intersection model to control reactive outcomes, achieving yields of the desired state approaching 100%. In addition to providing a practical tool, the quantum committor provides a conceptual framework for understanding reactions in cases when classical intuitions fail. ",

The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross-section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes. ",
