    "abstract": "Quantum computing exposes the brilliance of quantum mechanics through computer science and, as such, gives oneself a marvelous and exhilarating journey to go through. This article leads along that journey with a historical and current outlook on quantum computation that is geared toward computer experts but also to experts from other disciplines as well. It is an article that will bridge the vast gap between classical and quantum computation and open an entering wedge through which one will be able to both bring himself up to speed on quantum computation and, intrinsically, in a straightforward manner, become acquainted with it. We are indeed in luck to be living in an age where computing is being reinvented, and not only seeing history in the making firsthand but, in fact, having the opportunity to be the ones who are reinventing--and that is quite a thought.

The entanglement measure (Schmidt weight) is resolved on a sub-cycle timescale, and its key dependency on the field profile is exposed for the first time by tuning the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) to control the ionization-recollision timing.

A connection is made between the entanglement, the probability current, and the correlation coefficient for the two electron momenta, providing new insights into the nonsequential ionization mechanism.

    "title": "Derivation of Antenna $Q$-factor based on Antenna Scattering-Matrix  Theory",
    "abstract": "A radio antenna is primarily designed to convert electromagnetic waves into electrical current and vice versa. However, a part of the incident wavefield is scattered due to structural effects and reflected power at the antenna's electrical port. Because the latter depends on the load impedance, an antenna can also be referred to as a loaded scatterer. Its interaction with electromagnetic waves is defined by means of absorption and scattering cross-sections (ACS and SCS). When immersed in a diffuse field such as the one generated within a reverberation chamber (RC), the impact of the load antenna results from averaged properties over incident angles. One fundamental quantity is the antenna quality factor (Q-factor) directly related to the averaged ACS. Current formulations of Q-factor are based on different power budget analysis which do not enable the consideration of wave interferences between the ingoing and outgoing fields. Additionally, the structural component is always neglected in the current formulations. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous formulation of the antenna Q-factor which takes into account the aforementioned effects. The antenna is modeled using the scattering-matrix theory which linearly links the ingoing and outgoing waves in terms of spherical harmonics expansion. The derived theory is validated using several numerical simulations based on a Method-of-Moment code. Then, the capability to take advantage of this model to retrieve antenna properties from multiple Q-factor estimations in an RC is demonstrated. All results are compared to the existing Q-factor formulations. ",

    "abstract": "The exchange of energy between electronic and nuclear motion is the origin of non-adiabaticity and plays an important role in many molecular phenomena and processes. Conical intersections (CIs) of different electronic potential energy surfaces lead to the most singular non-adiabaticity and have been intensely investigated. The coupling of light and matter induces conical intersections which are termed light-induced conical intersections (LICIs). There are two kinds of LICIs, those induced by classical (laser) light and those by quantum light like that provided by a cavity. The present work reviews the subject of LICIs, discussing the achievements made so far. Particular attention is paid to comparing classical and quantum LICIs, their similarities and differences and their relationship to naturally occurring CIs. In contrast to natural CIs, the properties of which are dictated by nature, the properties of their light-induced counterparts are controllable by choosing the frequency and intensity (or coupling to the cavity) of the external light source. This opens the door to inducing and manipulating various kinds of non-adiabatic effects. Several examples of diatomic and polyatomic molecules are presented covering both dynamics and spectroscopy. The computational methods employed are discussed as well. To our opinion, the young field of LICIs and their impact shows much future potential. ",

The laser pulse consists of two orthogonally-polarized components with a time delay comparable to the pulse duration, such that the polarization in the middle of the pulse rapidly rotates over 90$^\\circ$ within few optical cycles. Three-dimensional (3D) Particle-in-Cell simulations show that when such a light pulse diffracts at the edge of a plasma foil, a series of isolated relativistic electron bunches are emitted into separated azimuthal angles determined by the varying polarization. In comparison with most other methods that require an ultra-short drive laser, we show the proposed scheme works well with typical multi-cycle ($\\sim 30~$fs) pulses from high-power laser facilities. The generated electron bunches have typical durations of a few hundred attoseconds and charges of tens of picocoulombs. ",

Here, we systematically investigate a general family of photonic circuits for realizing arbitrary unitaries based on a simple architecture that interlaces a fixed intervening layer with programmable phase shifter layers.

We explore this criterion for different photonic components, including photonic waveguide lattices and meshes of directional couplers, which allows the identification of several families of photonic components that can serve as the intervening layers in the interlacing architecture.

    "abstract": "Building upon our previously introduced mechanism for ion trapping based on the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), we propose a novel approach to systematically draw ions closer together, solely via quantum measurements. The proposed method involves repeated measurements of the electromagnetic force exerted by ions on an enclosure of conductor plates to confine the ions within an incrementally smaller spatial region, achieved by exploiting the behaviour of the wavefunction at its boundaries. Taking a two-proton system as a case study, we explore the dynamics between the energy gain of the system, attributed to successive QZE measurements, and the energy expended making such measurements. The results reveal a paradox wherein, under specific circumstances, protons appear to accumulate more energy than is seemingly introduced into the system. This peculiarity aligns with prior studies that highlight challenges in energy conservation within quantum mechanics. To verify these observations, we propose an iterative confinement setup that is feasible with current technological capabilities. Confirmation of these findings could offer new insights for applications in quantum physics, including fusion research. Therefore, the proposed novel method of manipulating ions not only harbours considerable potential for diverse applications but also furnishes an additional tool for probing fundamental questions in the field.

    "title": "Transport of non-classical light mediated by topological domain walls in  a SSH photonic lattice",
    "abstract": "Advancements in photonics technologies have significantly enhanced their capability to facilitate experiments involving quantum light, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge. Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls, facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity, topology-protected quantum communication. ",
