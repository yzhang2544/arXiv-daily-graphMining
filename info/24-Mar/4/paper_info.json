We significantly refine their estimate for the number of holes that were present in the full ring. Our $68\\%$-credible estimate for this number, taking account of all the data, is $355.24^{ +1.39 }_{ -1.36 }$. If holes adjacent to fractures are removed from the analysis, our estimate becomes $354.08^{ +1.47}_{-1.41}$. A ring of 360 holes is strongly disfavoured, and one of 365 holes is not plausible, given our model assumptions. ",

    "title": "Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization  at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves",
    "abstract": "Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and sensing, among others, are set to revolutionize sectors ranging from materials science to drug discovery. Despite their significant potential, the implications for public health have been largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in recognition and preparation. This oversight necessitates immediate action, as public health remains largely unaware of quantum technologies as a tool for advancement. The application of quantum principles to epidemiology and health informatics, termed quantum health epidemiology and quantum health informatics, has the potential to radically transform disease surveillance, prediction, modeling, and analysis of health data. However, there is a notable lack of quantum expertise within the public health workforce and educational pipelines. This gap underscores the urgent need for the development of quantum literacy among public health practitioners, leaders, and students to leverage emerging opportunities while addressing risks and ethical considerations. Innovative teaching methods, such as interactive simulations, games, visual models, and other tailored platforms, offer viable solutions for bridging knowledge gaps without the need for advanced physics or mathematics. However, the opportunity to adapt is fleeting as the quantum era in healthcare looms near. It is imperative that public health urgently focuses on updating its educational approaches, workforce strategies, data governance, and organizational culture to proactively meet the challenges of quantum disruption thereby becoming quantum ready.

In this work, we propose a borophene-based structure capable of converting linearly polarized light into arbitrarily polarized light through the coherent excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in optical communication band. Furthermore, a double-layer borophene structure can be achieved by placing a second borophene array at the top of the first one with a 90{\\deg} relative rotation of their crystalline plane. The rotation direction of the polarization state of the reflected light can be switched by independently controlling the carrier concentration of the two-layer borophene. Finally, a dipole source is used to realize the emission of polarized light, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the emission rate in free space, and the polarization state can be dynamically controlled by manipulating the carrier concentration. Our study is simple and compact, with potential applications in the fields of polarizers, polarization detectors, and quantum emitters. ",

Solving this engineering challenge relies on stringent impedance matching and coupling of the multiple independent local resonators in metasurface absorbers. In this letter, we present an innovative design approach to broaden the sound absorption bandwidth at low-frequency regime. A hybrid metasurface design is proposed where four coupled planar coiled resonators are also coupled to a well designed thin planar cavity. This hybrid metasurface creates a broad sound absorption band (130-200 Hz) that is twice as wide as that of the traditional single layer metasurface utilizing four coiled cavities at a deep sub-wavelength thickness (< {\\lambda}/51). This design strategy open routes towards engineering a class of high performance thin metasurfaces for ultra-broadband sound absorption while keeping the planar size unchanged. ",

By re-framing the function of resonantly shunted piezoelectric transducers as frequency dependent variable stiffness elements, it is of great interest to investigate their capabilities to realize frequency dependent topologies (in the sense of the mechanical connectivity) in the frame of lattice metamaterials, where the load path within a lattice can be interrupted at will for specific frequencies by intercalating null-stiffness components realized with resonantly shunted piezoelectrics.

Similar results with both methods are obtained with differences below $1\\%$ . Nevertheless, important differences are found with respect to the resonant wavelengths computed with a constant index and with a variable index. We compute the free spectral range and the quality factor, and make a comparison between the variable index and the constant index cases.

Moreover, when searching for relativistic or quasi-relativistic beyond-the-Standard-Model particles (i.e., $v/c\\gtrsim 0.01$) that have an enhanced cross section for small energy transfers, a comparatively small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we provide accurate calculations of the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We focus on silicon, although our results can be easily applied to other materials. We consider the full material response, in particular also the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against publicly available electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations of energy loss that are commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, the inclusion of collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and dark-matter particles that are upscattered by cosmic rays or in the Sun. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.

For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of 1.28 x 10^-7 is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons. ",
