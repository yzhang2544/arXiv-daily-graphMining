    "title": "RLC resonator with diode nonlinearity: Bifurcation comparison of  numerical predictions and circuit measurements",
    "abstract": "A nonlinear RLC resonator is investigated experimentally and numerically using bifurcation analysis. The nonlinearity is due to the parallel combination of a semiconductor rectifier diode and a fixed capacitor. The diode's junction capacitance, diffusion capacitance, and DC current-voltage relation each contribute to the nonlinearity. The closely related RL-diode resonator has been of interest for many years since its demonstration of period-doubling cascades to chaos. In this study a direct comparison is made of dynamical regime maps produced from simulations and circuit measurements. The maps show the variety of limit cycles, their bifurcations, and regions of chaos over the 2-d parameter space of the source voltage's frequency and amplitude. The similar structures of the simulated and experimental maps suggests that the diode models commonly used in circuit simulators (e.g., SPICE) work well in bifurcation analyses, successfully predicting complex and chaotic dynamics detected in the circuit. These results may be useful for applications of varactor-loaded split ring resonators. ",

    "abstract": "We propose and demonstrate hybrid all-optical switching devices that combine silicon nanocavities and two-dimensional semiconductor material. By exploiting the refractive index modulation caused by photo-induced carriers in the two-dimensional material instead of the silicon substrate, we overcome the switching performance limitation imposed by the substrate material. Air-mode photonic crystal nanobeam cavities capable of efficient interaction with two-dimensional materials are fabricated, and molybdenum ditelluride, a two-dimensional material with rapid carrier recombination, is transferred onto the cavities. The molybdenum ditelluride flake is excited by an optical pump pulse to shift the resonant wavelength of the cavity for switching operation. We have successfully achieved all-optical switching operations on the time scale of tens of picoseconds while requiring low switching energies of a few hundred femtojoules. ",

    "abstract": "We report the observation of two additional sub-natural line width quantum interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation. Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived quantum memory. ",

The 9 GHz sapphire oscillator was constructed with the SSB phase noise close to -170 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 10 kHz and fractional frequency instability less than 2 10$^{-13}$ for integration times from 5 to 50 s. In this work, we focus on the technique for phase-referencing the microwave sapphire oscillator to a stable radio-frequency source. We also discuss the suppression of the fast phase fluctuations of the microwave signal due to its transmission through the high-Q resonator. ",

We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.

In this article, we propose a new method to compute these parameters. In this method, the attenuation is expressed in function of the refractive index. The theoretical unwrapped angle, which therefore only depends on the refractive index, is then matched to the experimental value. By applying already existing methods for estimating the thickness of an optically thick sample, the dielectric properties of the sample can be deduced. The method is applied both to the transmission and reflection spectroscopy. A demonstration of the method and a comparison with the previous methods are finally shown. ",

    "abstract": "Data acquisition, image processing, and image quality are the long-lasting issues for terahertz (THz) 3D reconstructed imaging. Existing methods are primarily designed for 2D scenarios, given the challenges associated with obtaining super-resolution (SR) data and the absence of an efficient SR 3D reconstruction framework in conventional computed tomography (CT). Here, we demonstrate BLIss, a new approach for THz SR 3D reconstruction with sparse 2D data input. BLIss seamlessly integrates conventional CT techniques and variational framework with the core of the adapted Euler-Elastica-based model. The quantitative 3D image evaluation metrics, including the standard deviation of Gaussian, mean curvatures, and the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), validate the superior smoothness and fidelity achieved with our variational framework approach compared with conventional THz CT modal. Beyond its contributions to advancing THz SR 3D reconstruction, BLIss demonstrates potential applicability in other imaging modalities, such as X-ray and MRI. This suggests extensive impacts on the broader field of imaging applications. ",

    "abstract": "Niobium carbide (NbC) is a high-field Type II superconductor with a critical temperature ($T_C$) of 11.1 K, just above that of pure Nb ($T_C = 9$ K). Downsizing NbC to the nanoparticle scale introduces significant alterations in its critical field and/or the superconducting temperature. Here we report on superconducting NbC nanoparticles with $T_C \\approx$ 10 K synthesized by laser ablation in acetone, using the lens-target distance (laser fluence) and centrifugation as control parameters of the particle size. X-ray diffraction analyses certified the cubic NbC phase and electron microscopy images revealed spherical particles with average size near 8 nm, with no apparent size dependence on fluence. Besides, magnetization curves exhibited magnetic loops featuring a saturation magnetization around $10^{-3} \\mu_B$/molecule along with a small and typical superconducting loop for all investigated samples. We also observed a suppression of the diamagnetic behavior below $T_C$ upon decreasing laser fluence. Moreover, all samples exhibited a weak electron spin resonance (ESR) Curie-like signal at $g\\approx2.0$ probably associated with localized defects in the particle's surface. The intriguing coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in nanoparticles has recently garnered significant research attention. This complex scenario and unique properties are due to the substantial increase of surface-to-volume ratio in these superconducting NbC nanoparticles and further investigation would be crucial to unveil novel material properties and shed new light on our understanding of the superconducting phenomenon in this new morphology.

Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables.
