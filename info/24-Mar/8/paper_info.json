    "title": "Relational Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Relativism, and the Iteration of  Relativity",
    "abstract": "The idea that the dynamical properties of quantum systems are invariably relative to other systems has recently regained currency. Using Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) for a case study, this paper calls attention to a question that has been underappreciated in the debate about quantum relativism: the question of whether relativity iterates. Are there absolute facts about the properties one system possesses relative to a specified reference, or is this again a relative matter, and so on? It is argued that RQM (in its best-known form) is committed to what I call the Unrestricted Iteration Principle (UIP), and thus to an infinite regress of relativisations. This principle plays a crucial role in ensuring the communicability and coherence of interaction outcomes across observers. It is, however, shown to be incompatible with the widespread, conservative reading of RQM in terms of relations, instead necessitating the adoption of the more unorthodox notion of perspectival facts. I conclude with some reflections on the current state of play in perspectivist versions of RQM and quantum relativism more generally, underscoring both the need for further conceptual development and the importance of the iteration principle for an accurate cost-benefit analysis of such interpretations.

    "abstract": "As optical telecommunication networks become more complex, there is an emerging need for systems capable of very complex switching and manipulation of large numbers of optical signals. MEMS enable these systems by combining excellent capabilities and optical properties of macroscopic optomechanics with dense integration of multiple actuators on a single chip. Such optical MEMS present common design and process challenges, such as multiple electrical and optical IO, optical surface quality, optical integration density (fill factor) and actuator performance and reliability. We have used general design approaches such as pure-flexure design, electrostatic actuation and residual stress engineering in addressing these challenges. On several examples in this paper we illustrate these approaches along with underlying design tradeoffs and process requirements. We also describe specific numerical techniques useful for electrostatic actuator optimization and for analyzing the effects of residual stress. ",

    "abstract": "Optically bistable materials respond to a single input with two possible optical outputs, contingent upon excitation history. Such materials would be ideal for optical switching and memory, yet limited understanding of intrinsic optical bistability (IOB) prevents development of nanoscale IOB materials suitable for devices. Here, we demonstrate IOB in Nd3+-doped KPb2Cl5 avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs), which switch with high contrast between luminescent and non-luminescent states, with hysteresis characteristic of bistability. We elucidate a nonthermal mechanism in which IOB originates from suppressed nonradiative relaxation in Nd3+ ions and from the positive feedback of photon avalanching, resulting in extreme, >200th-order optical nonlinearities. Modulation of laser pulsing tunes hysteresis widths, and dual-laser excitation enables transistor-like optical switching. This control over nanoscale IOB establishes ANPs for photonic devices in which light is used to manipulate light. ",

    "abstract": "Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising photonic platform that could allow for light generation, manipulation, and sample interaction all within the same compact device. Integrated sample interaction geometries for on-chip sensors have not yet been well explored in lithium niobate. We use a model thin-film lithium niobate rib waveguide excited with a 406 nm laser diode to spatially resolve the scattering and fluorescence distributions from a 60 nm dye-doped polymer film. We determine that both the quasi-transverse-electric (TE) and quasi-transverse-magnetic (TM) modes have propagation losses dominated by scatter, and that the absorption due to the sample only accounts for approximately 3% of the experiment for both modes. Although the TM mode has better overlap with the sample, the even stronger propagation loss due to scattering in the TM mode (32.5 $\\pm$ 0.3 dB/cm) compared to the TE mode (23.0 $\\pm$ 0.2 dB/cm) reduces how many molecules are excited with a given input power, thus the TE mode could be more appropriate for sensing. Our findings have important implications in compatibility with other integrated components within a practical lithium niobate device and serve to guide future studies into sample integration towards completely on-chip lithium niobate-based sensors.

Our pioneering work introduces a photonic linear processing unit (LPU) that utilizes a cascading modulator structure incorporating micro-rings. This device, elegantly designed with only two thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators coupled with a micro-ring, stands as a paradigm of innovation that merges low-power consumption with formidable computational throughput, achieving 36.7 billion operations per second (GOPs).The crux of our design lies in the ring-modulator's flexible architecture, engineered as a compact and singular unit, which markedly streamlines system complexity while bolstering energy efficiency. It adeptly facilitates large-scale dot-product operations, supporting vector dimensions up to 5832, an impressive feat by current standards. Furthermore, this ring-modulator-based LPU exhibits proficiency in image classification, processing 28*28-pixel resolution imagery post hardware training. As data volume demands surge, our architecture offers a scalable solution through parallel matrix multiplications, which hinge solely on increased modulation rates.

    "abstract": "Many photonic devices, such as photonic crystal slabs, cross gratings, and periodic metasurfaces, are biperiodic structures with two independent periodic directions, and are sandwiched between two homogeneous media. Many applications of these devices are closely related to resonance phenomena. Therefore, efficient computation of resonant modes is crucial in device design and structure analysis. Since resonant modes satisfy outgoing radiation conditions, perfectly matched layers (PMLs) are usually used to truncate the unbounded spatial variable perpendicular to the periodic directions. In this paper, we develop an efficient method without using PMLs to calculate resonant modes in biperiodic structures. We reduce the original eigenvalue problem to a small matrix nonlinear eigenvalue problem which is solved by the contour integral method. Numerical examples show that our method is efficient with respect to memory usage and CPU time, free of spurious solutions, and determines degenerate resonant modes without any difficulty. ",

By an appropriate choice of inhomogeneous magnetic field, one can construct a configuration wherein the same EM wave pulse encounters more than one resonance in the plasma. A 2-D Particle - In - Cell (PIC) simulation using the OSIRIS4.0 platform has been carried out for the case of dual resonance. It is observed that in the presence of dual resonance, there is a significant enhancement in leading to almost complete absorption of laser energy by the plasma in certain cases.

Mixed crystals with arbitrary Nb-Ta ratios provide a new degree of freedom to tune materials properties, such as the birefringence, but also leverage the advantages of the singular compounds, for example, by combining the thermal stability of lithium tantalate with the larger nonlinear or piezoelectric constants of lithium niobate. Periodic poling is the prerequisite for any nonlinear optical application. For mixed crystals this has been challenging so far due to the lack of homogeneous, mono-domain crystals, which severely inhibit domain growth and nucleation. In this work we demonstrate that surface-near ($< 1$~$\\mu$m depth) periodic poling on x-cut lithium niobate tantalate mixed crystals can be achieved via electric field poling and lithographically structured electrodes. We find that naturally occurring head-to-head or tail-to-tail domain walls in the as-grown crystal inhibit domain inversion at a larger scale. However, periodic poling is possible, if the gap size between the poling electrodes is of the same order of magnitude or smaller than the average size of naturally occurring domains. This work provides the basis for the nonlinear optical application of lithium niobate tantalate mixed crystals. ",

In that respect we carried out a set of numerical simulation using AFORS-HET simulation program. Separately, in order to get a better understanding, the optical absorption in individual layers devices were analyzed. Current-voltage characteristic curve of a reference cell (Cell-A) was used as the starting device. The PCE of the reference device was $8.85\\%$ with short circuit current density $J_{sc}$ of 15.43 mA/cm$^{2}$ and fill factor (FF) of $68.3\\%$. However, it was noticed that the reference cell had high parasitic optical absorption at the window layer and the device structure was also not optimized. After suitable optimization the PCE of this device (Cell-B2) improves to $111.59\\%$ ($J_{sc}$ and FF of 13.0 mA/cm$^{2}$ and $87\\%$ respectively). The results show that the effective optical absorption in the active layer can be improved significantly by optimizing the device structure. The short wavelength response can be improved by reducing the parasitic optical absorption by the doped window layer, while its long wavelength response improves by raising effective absorption length of the active layer. Furthermore, its optimum thickness, for the highest possible PCE, is found to be dependent upon the material properties, more importantly on its defect density. ",

STOVs are born from point phase defects on the sides of the pulse nucleated by spatiotemporal phase shear. These defects grow into closed loops of spatiotemporal vorticity that initially exclude the pulse propagation axis, but then reconnect to form a pair of toroidal vortex rings that wrap around it. STOVs constrain the intrapulse flow of electromagnetic energy, controlling the focusing-defocusing cycles and pulse splitting inherent to nonlinear pulse propagation. We illustrate this in two widely studied but very different regimes, relativistic self-focusing in plasma and non-relativistic self-focusing in gas, demonstrating that STOVs mediate nonlinear propagation irrespective of the detailed physics.

Harnessing the pure randomness of quantum vacuum noise, which stems from fluctuating electromagnetic fields, has shown promise for high speed and energy-efficient stochastic photonic elements. Nevertheless, photonic computing hardware which can control these stochastic elements to program probabilistic machine learning algorithms has been limited. Here, we implement a photonic probabilistic computer consisting of a controllable stochastic photonic element - a photonic probabilistic neuron (PPN). Our PPN is implemented in a bistable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with vacuum-level injected bias fields. We then program a measurement-and-feedback loop for time-multiplexed PPNs with electronic processors (FPGA or GPU) to solve certain probabilistic machine learning tasks. We showcase probabilistic inference and image generation of MNIST-handwritten digits, which are representative examples of discriminative and generative models. In both implementations, quantum vacuum noise is used as a random seed to encode classification uncertainty or probabilistic generation of samples. In addition, we propose a path towards an all-optical probabilistic computing platform, with an estimated sampling rate of ~ 1 Gbps and energy consumption of ~ 5 fJ/MAC.

However, the center's low native fraction of coherent photon emission, $\\sim$3\\%, strongly reduces the achievable spin-photon entanglement rates. Here, we couple a nitrogen-vacancy center with a narrow extrinsically broadened linewidth (\\unit[159]{MHz}), hosted in a micron-thin membrane, to the mode of an open optical microcavity. The resulting Purcell factor of $\\sim$1.8 increases the fraction of zero-phonon line photons to above 44\\%, leading to coherent photon emission rates exceeding four times the state of the art under non-resonant excitation. Bolstered by the enhancement provided by the cavity, we for the first time measure resonance fluorescence without any temporal filtering with $>$10 signal-to-laser background ratio. Our microcavity platform would increase spin-spin entanglement success probabilities by more than an order of magnitude compared to existing implementations. Selective enhancement of the center's zero-phonon transitions could furthermore unlock efficient application of quantum optics techniques such as wave-packet shaping or all-optical spin manipulation.

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the impact of weak perturbations of a flat potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. We use a mean-field perturbative treatment of the potential defects and derive their effects at first order in the mean-field stable regime. We first focus on defects containing a single spatial frequency and study the wavevector dependence of the density perturbation. A qualitative modification of the wavenumber dependence with the interaction parameters and a sensitivity in the excitation direction reveal the long-range and anisotropic dipolar effects. These effects are found to be most important at intermediate wavenumbers and can give rise to a local maximum in the density perturbation reminiscent of the roton mode softening and local instabilities. The dependence on the gas and interaction parameters is studied. The case of a flat potential perturbed with white noise on a certain momentum range is then examined. Here it is found that the strength perturbation becomes independent of the mean density when sufficiently large. Our study touches upon experimentally relevant issues, giving hints on how flat a uniform potential should be to achieve uniform quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gases. ",
