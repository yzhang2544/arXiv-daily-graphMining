    "abstract": "Vibrational resonance (VR) is a nonlinear phenomenon in which the system response to a weak signal can be resonantly enhanced by applying a high-frequency modulation signal with an appropriate amplitude. The majority of VR research has focused on amplifying the amplitude or intensity of the system response to a weak signal, whereas the study of the phase information of system responses in VR remains limited. Here, we investigate the VR phenomena in both amplitude and phase quadratures of an optical field in a Kerr nonlinear cavity driven by a near-resonant weak signal and a far-detuned modulation signal. Analytical and numerical results demonstrated that the resonant enhancement in the amplitude and phase quadratures of the system response to a weak signal simultaneously occurs as the amplitude of the modulation signal is varied. There is a linear relation between the amplitude and frequency of the modulation signal for achieving an optimal VR effect. Furthermore, we generalized our study to investigate the quadrature at an arbitrary phase and determined that the VR enhancement sensitively depends on the phase. Our findings not only broaden the scope of VR research by incorporating phase information but also introduces an approach for amplifying an optical field by manipulating another optical field. ",

A 1.618-millimeter-long crystal is initially bent into a hairpin-like bent waveguide. Later, a meticulous mechanophotonic strategy is employed to sculpt the hairpin-like bent waveguide into the Fermat spiral geometry, covering a compact area of 330x238 um2. The optical signal in FSOW survives two sharp 180-degree turns to produce optical output. The remarkably low bending-induced optical loss in FSOW can be ascribed to the smooth-defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The development of such versatile optical components capable of transducing light through sharp bends is pivotal for realizing large-scale all-organic photonic circuits. ",

Here, we report on a miniaturizable spectrometer platform where light throughput onto the detector is instead enhanced as the resolution is increased. This planar, CMOS-compatible platform is based around metasurface encoders designed to exhibit photonic bound states in the continuum9, where operational range can be altered or extended simply through adjusting geometric parameters. This system can enhance photon collection efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude versus conventional designs; we demonstrate this sensitivity advantage through ultra-low-intensity fluorescent and astrophotonic spectroscopy.

A particular feature of such warm dense matter is the complex interplay of strong Coulomb interactions, quantum effects, and thermal excitations, rendering its rigorous theoretical description a formidable challenge. Here, we report a breakthrough in path integral Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to unravel this intricate interplay for light elements without nodal restrictions. This new capability gives us access to electronic correlations previously unattainable. As an example, we apply our method to strongly compressed beryllium to describe x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) data obtained at the National Ignition Facility.

To understand the influence of electron-correlation effects, we have also calculated the singlet-triplet energy gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs. Because of the presence of edge hydrogens, these GQDs are effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, $C_{2v}$, and $C_{2h}$, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations. ",

    "abstract": "This computational research study analyzes the increase of the specific charge capacity that comes with the reduction of the anisotropic volume expansion during lithium ion insertion within silicon nanowires. This research paper is a continuation from previous work that studied the expansion rate and volume increase. It has been determined that when the lithium ion concentration is decreased by regulating the amount of Li ion flux, the lithium ions to silicon atoms ratio, represented by x, decreases within the amorphous lithiated silicon (a-LixSi) material. This results in a decrease in the volumetric strain of the lithiated silicon nanowire as well as a reduction in Maxwell stress that was calculated and Youngs elastic module that was measured experimentally using nanoindentation. The conclusion as will be seen is that as there is a decrease in lithium ion concentration there is a corresponding decrease in anisotropic volume and a resulting increase in specific charge capacity. In fact the amplification of the electromagnetic field due to the electron flux that created detrimental effects for a fully lithiated silicon nanowire at x = 3.75 which resulted in over a 300 percent volume expansion becomes beneficial with the decrease in lithium ion flux as x approaches 0.75, which leads to a marginal volume increase of 25 percent. This could lead to the use of crystalline silicon, c-Si, as an anode material that has been demonstrated in many previous research works to be ten times greater charge capacity than carbon base anode material for lithium ion batteries.

    "abstract": "The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speed up the optimization procedure. ",

Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.

The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit.

This is accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between 700 rubidium atoms in which we harness a pair of momentum states as the effective pseudo spin or qubit degree of freedom. Using this capability we realize for the first time the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model, an iconic XYZ collective spin model that can generate spin-squeezed states that saturate the Heisenberg limit bound. The versatility of our platform to include more than two relevant momentum states, combined with the flexibility of the simulated Hamiltonians by adding cavity tones opens rich opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum sensing in matter-wave interferometers and other quantum sensors such as optical clocks and magnetometers.
