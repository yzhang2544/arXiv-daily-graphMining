    "title": "Stochastic Thermodynamics of a Linear Optical Cavity Driven On Resonance",
    "abstract": "           We present a complete framework of stochastic thermodynamics for a single-mode linear optical cavity driven on resonance. We first show that the steady-state intra-cavity field follows the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The effective temperature is given by the noise variance, and the equilibration rate is the dissipation rate. Next we derive expressions for internal energy, work, heat, and free energy of light in a cavity, and formulate the first and second laws of thermodynamics for this system. We then analyze fluctuations in work and heat, and show that they obey universal statistical relations known as fluctuation theorems. Finite time corrections to the fluctuation theorems are also discussed. Additionally, we show that work fluctuations obey the Crook's Fluctuation theorem which is a paradigm for understanding emergent phenomena and estimating free energy differences. The significance of our results is two-fold. On one hand, our work positions optical cavities as a unique platform for fundamental studies of stochastic thermodynamics. On the other hand, our work paves the way for improving the energy efficiency and information processing capabilities of laser-driven optical resonators using a thermodynamics based prescription.

    "abstract": "           Calibrating the optical properties within the detection medium of a neutrino telescope is crucial for determining its angular resolution and energy scale. For the next generation of neutrino telescopes planned to be constructed in deep water, such as the TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT), there are additional challenges due to the dynamic nature and potential non-uniformity of the water medium. This necessitates a real-time optical calibration system distributed throughout the large detector array. This study introduces a custom-designed CMOS camera system equipped with rapid image processing algorithms, providing a real-time optical calibration method for TRIDENT and other similar projects worldwide. In September 2021, the TRIDENT Pathfinder experiment (TRIDENT Explorer, T-REX for short) successfully deployed this camera system in the West Pacific Ocean at a depth of 3420 meters. Within 30 minutes, about 3000 images of the T-REX light source were captured, allowing for the in-situ measurement of seawater attenuation and absorption lengths under three wavelengths. This deep-sea experiment for the first time showcased a technical demonstration of a functioning camera calibration system in a dynamic neutrino telescope site, solidifying a substantial part of the calibration strategies for the future TRIDENT project.

Here, we demonstrate DOPO within the coupled modes of a silicon nitride triple-state photonic molecule. Our design introduces a distinctive mechanism for spectral engineering, using microheaters to individually tune the resonance spectral positions, thus enabling dynamic local dispersion control within the coupled modes. We successfully generate a DOPO signal with active efficiency control and explore the optical mode spacing in the tens of gigahertz range to use native phase-locked optical pumps driven by a radio-frequency source.

    "abstract": "           We implement a stacking strategy in designing chiral metasurfaces with high rotational symmetry, enabling quasi-bound-in-the-continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances characterized by absolute chirality. The rotational symmetry allows a circularly polarized pump to be converted into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Meanwhile, our bilayered metasurface can be engineered to respond solely to one selected circular polarization. Consequently, integrating resonant chiral response and rotational symmetry endows a unique category of metasurfaces to upconvert any linear or unpolarized pump into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Our results reveal that when such a metasurface is subjected to a linearly polarized pump, the intensity ratio of the resultant circularly polarized signals varies with the order of the nonlinear process. Counterintuitively, this ratio scales as the fourth power of the local field enhancement in the second harmonic process and the second power in the third harmonic process. Our work offers a comprehensive theoretical description of the nonlinear processes in chiral structures with rotation and provides universal guidelines for designing nonlinear all-dielectric metasurfaces with a strong chiral response.

Meanwhile, the qualities of laser-induced color centers are well guaranteed. Femtosecond laser processing suffices for increasing the yield of $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color centers in bulk materials and forms crater-shaped enriched regions on the surface. However, there is a notable absence of existing simulation methods to explain the mechanisms behind laser-assisted $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color center generation. In this work, we design a three-dimensional molecular dynamics (3D-MD) model using an integral hemi-ellipsoidal shell mathematical model to simulate the interaction of Gaussian laser beams with bulk materials. Furthermore, we calculate the transmittance, absorption coefficient, refractive index, and reflectivity of $4H$-SiC. Then, the absorptance of a 1030 nm laser in 350 {\\mu}m-thick $4H$-SiC material is abtained to simulate the energy loss during the actual processing. Finally, the study analyzes the movement trajectories of $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color centers and explains the source of $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ on the surface. This analysis explains the reasons for the enrichment of color centers in the crater-shaped regions formed after laser deposition.

    "abstract": "           Controlling the light emitted by individual molecules is instrumental to a number of novel nanotechnologies ranging from super-resolution bio-imaging and molecular sensing to quantum nanophotonics. Molecular emission can be tailored by modifying the local photonic environment, for example by precisely placing a single molecule inside a plasmonic nanocavity with the help of DNA origami. Here, using this scalable approach, we show that commercial fluorophores experience giant Purcell factors and Lamb shifts, reaching values on par with those recently reported in scanning tip experiments. Engineering of plasmonic modes enables cavity-mediated fluorescence far detuned from the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) - at detunings that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than the fluorescence linewidth of the bare emitter and reach into the near-infrared. Our results evidence a regime where the emission linewidth is dominated by the excited state lifetime, as required for indistinguishable photon emission, baring relevance to the development of nanoscale, ultrafast quantum light sources and to the quest toward single-molecule cavity-QED. In the future, this approach may also allow to design efficient quantum emitters at infrared wavelengths, where standard organic sources have a reduced performance.         ",

This work demonstrates an electro-optic frequency comb with > 120 GHz of bandwidth and a 75 MHz repetition rate. The comb has three cascaded electro-optic modulators driven at sequentially lower harmonics, the last megahertz modulation dictating the repetition rate. This architecture can modulate at any individual harmonic and repetition rate without changes to the components.

In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\\geq 40$~dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2~MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50~MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent years have witnessed the use of pervasive wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, and mmWave) for sensing purposes. Due to its non-intrusive characteristic, wireless sensing plays an important role in various intelligent sensing applications. However, limited by the inherent thermal noise of RF transceivers, the sensing granularity of existing wireless sensing systems are still coarse, limiting their adoption for fine-grained sensing applications. In this paper, we introduce the quantum receiver, which does not contain traditional electronic components such as mixers, amplifiers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to wireless sensing systems, significantly reducing the source of thermal noise. By taking non-intrusive liquid recognition as an application example, we show the superior performance of quantum wireless sensing. By leveraging the unique property of quantum receiver, we propose a novel double-ratio method to address several well-known challenges in liquid recognition, eliminating the effect of liquid volume, device-target distance and container. We implement the quantum sensing prototype and evaluate the liquid recognition performance comprehensively. The results show that our system is able to recognize 17 commonly seen liquids, including very similar ones~(e.g., Pepsi and Coke) at an accuracy higher than 99.9\\%. For milk expiration monitoring, our system is able to achieve an accuracy of 99.0\\% for pH value measurements at a granularity of 0.1, which is much finer than that required for expiration monitoring.

    "abstract": "           While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.

This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.

In this work, we extend our previous studies of materials discovery using classical active learning (AL), which showed remarkable economy of data, to explore the use of quantum algorithms within the AL framework (QAL) as implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses quantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor (QGPR) with various quantum kernels and different feature maps. Data sets include perovskite properties (piezoelectric coefficient, band gap, energy storage) and the structure optimization of a doped nanoparticle (3Al@Si11) chosen to compare with classical AL results. Our results revealed that the QAL method improved the searches in most cases, but not all, seemingly correlated with the roughness of the data. QAL has the potential of finding optimum solutions, within chemical space, in materials science and elsewhere in chemistry.         ",

We support this claim by producing for every knot $K$ in the knot table up to 8 crossings a complex field $\\Psi:\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies the paraxial wave equation and whose zeros have a connected component in the shape of $K$.

Such edge modes are the eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by connecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants, and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of two individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the shared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in order to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite optimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables efficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting symmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological invariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis of the band gap function and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the optimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem efficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in generating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.         ",

Whilst attention has been focused on developing realistic models for the molecular systems, the important role played by the entire photonic mode structure of the optical cavities has been less explored. We show that the effectiveness of molecular strong coupling may be critically dependent on cavity finesse. Specifically we only see emission associated with a dispersive lower polariton for cavities with sufficient finesse. By developing an analytical model of cavity photoluminescence in a multimode structure we clarify the role of finite-finesse in polariton formation, and show that lowering the finesse reduces the extent of the mixing of light and matter in polariton states. We suggest that the detailed nature of the photonic modes supported by a cavity will be as important in developing a coherent framework for molecular strong coupling as the inclusion of realistic molecular models.

The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in combustion.         ",
