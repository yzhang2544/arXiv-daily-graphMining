Beyond data, from our shared personal experiences as female tenured quantum physics professors, we believe that the current model of scientific leadership, funding, and authority fails to represent many of us. It is time for a real change that calls for a different kind of force and for the participation of everyone.

    "title": "Quantum microwave photonic mixer with a large spurious-free dynamic range",
    "abstract": "           As one of the most fundamental functionalities of microwave photonics, microwave frequency mixing plays an essential role in modern radars and wireless communication systems. However, the commonly utilized intensity modulation in the systems often leads to inadequate spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for many sought-after applications. Quantum microwave photonics technique offers a promising solution for improving SFDR in terms of higher-order harmonic distortion. In this paper, we demonstrate two types of quantum microwave photonic mixers based on the configuration of the intensity modulators: cascade-type and parallel-type. Leveraging the nonlocal RF signal encoding capability, both types of quantum microwave photonic mixers not only exhibit the advantage of dual-channel output but also present significant improvement in SFDR. Specifically, the parallel-type quantum microwave photonic mixer achieves a remarkable SFDR value of 113.6 dB.Hz1/2, which is 30 dB better than that of the cascade-type quantum microwave photonic mixer. When compared to the classical microwave photonic mixer, this enhancement reaches a notable 53.6 dB at the expense of 8 dB conversion loss. These results highlight the superiority of quantum microwave photonic mixers in the fields of microwave and millimeter-wave systems. Further applying multi-photon frequency entangled sources as optical carriers, the dual-channel microwave frequency conversion capability endowed by the quantum microwave photonic mixer can be extended to enhance the performance of multiple-paths microwave mixing which is essential for radar net systems.

Vortex-antivortex (VAV) ensembles can be produced, self-organizing into the respective polar lattices. However, these structures are in general highly unstable due to the strong VAV attraction. Here, we demonstrate that multiple optical VAV clusters nested in the propagating coherent field can crystallize into patterns which preserve their lattice structures over distance up to several Rayleigh lengths. To explain this phenomenon, we present a model for effective interactions between the vortices and antivortices at different lattice sites. The observed VAV crystallization is a consequence of the globally balanced VAV couplings. As the crystallization does not require the presence of nonlinearities and appears in free space, it may find applications to high-capacity optical communications and multiparticle manipulations. Our findings suggest possibilities for constructing VAV complexes through the orbit-orbit couplings, which differs from the extensively studied spin-orbit couplings.         ",

However, improving the spatial resolution of instantaneous velocity fields and having access to the velocity field in real time remains a challenge. Optical Flow veolcimetry makes it possible to meet these challenges. In this study, we show that it is possible to access dense velocity fields (1 vector per pixel) in real-time using an appropriate seeding concentration adapted to optical flow algorithms and no longer to cross-correlation PIV algorithms. The influence of concentration on the quality of velocity fields is demonstrated using synthetic images generated for a Rankine vortex. We thus demonstrate that it is possible to precisely measure small vortices using optical flow provided that the seeding is suitable. The notion of \"Active Pixels\" is also introduced in order to define a seeding optimization criterion adapted to experimental measurements. This criterion is finally successfully applied to the flow downstream of a cylinder leading to a spatial resolution down to one vector per pixel.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ultrafast manipulation of optical resonance can establish the time-boundary effect in time-variant media leading to a new degree of freedom for coherent control of electromagnetic waves. Here, we demonstrate that a free-standing all dielectric Huygens metasurface of degenerate electric and magnetic resonances can prompt the broadband near-unity transmission in its static state, whereas it enables wave amplification in the presence of time boundary. The time boundary is realized by femtosecond laser excitations that transiently inject free carriers into the constituent meta-atoms for dynamic removal of a pre-established two-fold degeneracy. We observe that the transmittance in the photo-excited Huygens metasurface can exceed unity transmittance, i.e., THz wave amplification, by a factor over 20% in intensity at frequencies tunable by varying the arrival of time boundary with respect to that of the seed terahertz pulse. By numerical simulations and analysis with time-dependent coupled mode theory, we show that the wave amplification results from the ultrafast Q-switching and shift in resonant frequencies. This work demonstrates a new approach to achieve tunable amplification in an optical microcavity by exploiting the concept of time-variant media and the unique electromagnetic properties of Huygens metasurface.

In this work, Ge QDs, pumped by an above bandgap near infrared wavelength, exhibit THz amplitude modulation in the frequency range of 0.1-1.0 THz. The epitaxial Ge QDs outperform reference SOI substrate in THz amplitude modulation owing to higher carrier generation in weakly confined dots compared to its bulk counterpart. This is further corroborated using theoretical model based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. This model enables the calculation of photo carriers generated (PCG) and their confinement in the Ge QD region. Our model also reroutes the calculation from PCG to corresponding plasma frequency and hence to refractive index and THz photo-conductivity. Moreover, the photo-generated confined holes accumulation at the Ge QDs-Si interface is elevated after optical illumination, leading to a decreased THz photo-conductivity. This augmentation in THz photo-conductivity contributes to a significant enhancement of THz modulation depth ~77% at Ge QDs-Si interfaces compared to bare SOI at 0.1 THz.         ",

However, the challenge of implementing the backpropagation algorithm during training has limited their development. To address this, alternative machine learning schemes, such as extreme learning machines (ELMs), have been proposed. ELMs use a random hidden layer to increase the feature space dimensionality, requiring only the output layer to be trained through linear regression, thus reducing training complexity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a programmable photonic extreme learning machine (PPELM) using a hexagonal waveguide mesh, and which enables to program directly on chip the input feature vector and the random hidden layer. Our system also permits to apply the nonlinearity directly on-chip by using the systems integrated photodetecting elements. Using the PPELM we solved successfully three different complex classification tasks. Additioanlly, we also propose and demonstrate two techniques to increase the accuracy of the models and reduce their variability using an evolutionary algorithm and a wavelength division multiplexing approach, obtaining excellent performance. Our results show that programmable photonic processors may become a feasible way to train competitive machine learning models on a versatile and compact platform.         ",

Leveraging a two-dimensional hexagonal waveguide mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, these systems have demonstrated significant potential in microwave photonics applications. Additionally, they are a promising platform for creating unitary linear transformations, which are key elements in quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, a general procedure for implementing these transformations on such systems has not been established yet. This work demonstrates the programming of universal unitary transformations on a general-purpose programmable photonic circuit with a hexagonal topology. We detail the steps to split the light on-chip, demonstrate that an equivalent structure to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one internal and one external phase shifter can be built in the hexagonal mesh, and program both the triangular and rectangular architectures for matrix multiplication. We recalibrate the system to account for passive phase deviations. Experimental programming of 3x3 and 4x4 random unitary matrices yields fidelities > 98% and bit precisions over 5 bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that random unitary matrices are demonstrated on a general-purpose photonic processor and pave the way for the implementation of programmable photonic circuits in optical computing and signal processing systems.

This work aims to enhance temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an improved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. These data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In 2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43 degree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree centigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately 10%.

The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition.

Additionally, we recalculate bandgaps of these structures employing the HSE06 functional. 22 silicon allotropes are identified as potential photovoltaic materials. Among them, the energy per atom of Si22-Pm, which has a direct bandgap of 1.27 eV, is 0.026 eV/atom higher than diamond silicon. Si18-C2/m, which has a direct bandgap of 0.796 eV, exhibits the highest TDM among identified structures. Si16-P21/c, which has a direct bandgap of 0.907 eV, has the mass density of 2.316 g/cm3, which is the highest among identified structures and higher than that of diamond silicon. The structure Si12-P1, which possesses a direct bandgap of 1.69 eV, exhibits the highest spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) among identified structures at 32.28%, surpassing that of diamond silicon. This study offers insights into properties of silicon crystals while presenting a systematic high-throughput method for material discovery.         ",

    "title": "Active Polar Ring Polymer in Shear Flow -- An Analytical Study",
    "abstract": "           We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.

We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz, presenting an up to $\\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further display the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits coherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques based on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic response in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry breaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can be adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits, expanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising on-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.

    "abstract": "           Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter \\cite{altman2023quantum}, fundamental high-energy processes \\cite{bauer2023highenergy}, quantum metrology \\cite{degen2017sensing, li2023scrambling}, and quantum algorithms \\cite{ebadi2022quantum}. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains~\\cite{Samajdar2024}. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode \\cite{pekker2015amplitude}. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.         ",

    "abstract": "           One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they are highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and they have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as simplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because most real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.         ",

We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers.

This is accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between 700 rubidium atoms in which we harness a pair of momentum states as the effective pseudo spin or qubit degree of freedom. Using this capability we realize for the first time the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model at the mean-field level.
