    "abstract": "           We investigate the formation of particular patterns when light passes through glass. Experimentally, we use various glass plates, registering each reflected and transmitted outcome. Thus, we find the condition to form a common pattern, namely, randomly scratched plates produce the halos. We engineer other optical patterns by means of the specular holography method. Using the Defocusing Microscopy technique, we study the geometric properties of the glass, establishing the physical and mathematical model for a simulation. Our computational results agree well with the experimental ones, leading us to conclude that the pattern formation is governed by specular reflection on various points along the scratches. Our findings give an initial explanation for the pattern formation on glass, in particular for the halo design.         ",

This paper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic panel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The 0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For incident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our thermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of electrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.

    "abstract": "           Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (<-24dB) or pass (>-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nonvolatile photonic integrated circuits employing phase change materials have relied either on optical switching mechanisms with precise multi-level control but poor scalability or electrical switching with seamless integration and scalability but mostly limited to a binary response. Recent works have demonstrated electrical multi-level switching; however, they relied on the stochastic nucleation process to achieve partial crystallization with low demonstrated repeatability and cyclability. Here, we re-engineer waveguide-integrated microheaters to achieve precise spatial control of the temperature profile (i.e., hotspot) and, thus, switch deterministic areas of an embedded phase change material cell. We experimentally demonstrate this concept using a variety of foundry-processed doped-silicon microheaters on a silicon-on-insulator platform to trigger multi-step amorphization and reversible switching of Sb$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Se$_{4}$Te alloys. We further characterize the response of our microheaters using Transient Thermoreflectance Imaging. Our approach combines the deterministic control resulting from a spatially resolved glassy-crystalline distribution with the scalability of electro-thermal switching devices, thus paving the way to reliable multi-level switching towards robust reprogrammable phase-change photonic devices for analog processing and computing.

We demonstrate its ability to map mechanical modes and investigate mechanical damping effects in a capacitive coupling scheme, based on its spatial resolution. We also manipulate the energy transfer coherently between the mode of the scanning tip and the underlying silicon nitride membrane, via parametric coupling. Typical features of optomechanics, such as anti-damping and electromechanically induced transparency, have been observed. Since the microwave optomechanical technology is fully compatible with quantum electronics and very low temperature conditions, it should provide a powerful tool for studying phonon tunnelling between two spatially separated vibrating elements, which could potentially be applied to quantum sensing.

    "abstract": "           Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for the realization of high-performance chip-scale optical systems, spanning a range of applications from optical communications to microwave photonics. Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz, while long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 46 hours of mode-hop-free operation. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.         ",

However, many students regard quantum mechanics as a particularly challenging subject, in part because it is considered very mathematical and abstract. One potential way to help students understand and contextualize unintuitive quantum ideas is to provide them opportunities to work with physical apparatus demonstrating these phenomena. In order to understand how working with quantum experiments affects students' reasoning, we performed think-aloud lab sessions of two pairs of students as they worked through a sequence of quantum optics experiments that demonstrated particle-wave duality of photons. Analyzing the in-the-moment student thinking allowed us to identify the resources students activated while reasoning through the experimental evidence of single-photon interference, as well as student ideas about what parts of the experiments were quantum versus classical. This work will aid instructors in helping their students construct an understanding of these topics from their own ideas and motivate future investigations into the use of hands-on opportunities to facilitate student learning about quantum mechanics.

At the heart of chemical and physical sciences is the accurate ab initio calculation of many-body wavefunction, which has become one of the most notable examples to demonstrate the power of deep learning in science. In particular, the introduction of deep learning into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has significantly advanced the frontier of ab initio calculation, offering a universal tool to solve the electronic structure of materials and molecules. Deep learning QMC architectures were initial designed and tested on small molecules, focusing on comparisons with other state-of-the-art ab initio methods.

This review covers the theoretical foundation of deep learning QMC for solids, the neural network wavefunction ansatz, and various of other methodological developments. Applications on computing energy, electron density, electric polarization, force and stress of real solids are also reviewed. The methods have also been extended to other periodic systems and finite temperature calculations.

    "abstract": "           An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg to tens of mg per second, corresponding to boron flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the boron powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The powder particle size (5-250 $\\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving boron deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the carbon environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.         ",

In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM) caused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is supposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.

Methods: The proposed patch antenna array utilizes the MRI bore's RF shield as a functional component to enhance the RF magnetic field ($B_1^+$) distribution. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the performance of the patch antenna array to bore-integrated stripline and local dipole arrays. A decoupling structure was implemented to minimize coupling between adjacent patch antennas. The performance of the patch array was evaluated experimentally. Results: The proposed patch array provides 3.9 times higher averaged transmit (Tx) efficiency in the CP mode and 3.0 times higher for the phase shimming regime versus the bore-integrated stripline array. Conclusion: Compared to the stripline array, the bore-integrated patch antenna array offers significant improvements in Tx efficiency for whole-body UHF MRI. Significance: The findings support the feasibility of integrating arrays into the RF shield of MRI scanners. This could broaden the clinical use of UHF body MRI technology.         ",

    "abstract": "           We perform spin noise spectroscopy close to resonance in a 1-mm-thick cell containing a dense Rubidium vapor. A laser is used to excite optical dipoles in the vapor while probing the Faraday rotation noise. We report unusual lineshapes of the spin noise spectra with a strong density dependence, which we attribute to interactions arising between particles in the system. Introducing a two-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark of a strong dipole-dipole interaction between binaries within the ensemble. A precise fit of the experimental spectra allows to extract the strength and the duration of the dipole-dipole interaction. We unveil its impact on the spin noise frequency and investigate the role of the atomic motion in the unexpected lineshapes. This work demonstrates the potential of spin noise spectroscopy to observe and quantify strong interactions occurring within a particle ensemble.         ",

    "abstract": "           We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.         ",

Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.         ",

In phononics and spintronics, magnetoelastic coupling between Rayleigh-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) and spin wave (SW) has recently attracted much attention. Quantitatively evaluating and comparing the coupled system are essential to develop the study of the magnetoelastic SAW-SW coupling. So far, previous studies of SAW-SW coupling have employed a quantity called coupling strength. However, it is still challenging to compare the coupling strength values among studies fairly because the quantity depends on the device geometry and the applied magnetic field angle, which are not unified among the previous studies. Here, we focus on a practical constant composed of a magnetoelastic constant and a strain amplitude that depends only on the material properties. We demonstrate a versatile evaluation technique to evaluate the practical constant by combining electrical measurements and optical imaging. An essential part of the technique is an analysis that can be used under off-resonance conditions where SAW and SW resonance frequencies do not match. Existing analysis can only handle the case under on-resonance conditions. Our analysis makes it possible to observe the magnetoelastic couplings between SAW with resonance frequencies that can be imaged optically and SW with resonance frequencies in the gigahertz range. Our demonstrated technique, which uses electrical and optical measurements under off-resonance conditions, can significantly advance research on SAW-SW coupled systems.         ",

To make the system non-Hermitian, we use a traveling field directly interacting with magnons generating gain to the system. We start by illustrating PT-configuration of the system, which contains two PT broken region around exceptional point and PT protected region along the axis of exceptional point. Late, we discover that the numbers of cavity photons and magnons show bistable behavior depending upon the PT configuration, which becomes more significant as the values of the magnon-photon coupling and traveling field strength increases. We illustrate that steady-state photon only shows bistable behavior when the system in in lossy PT broken configuration, means strength of traveling field is less than the magnon-photon coupling. Otherwise, it will just contain a single stable state because of bistability suppression with gain in the system, which is unlike with any other investigation in this direction. Further, a larger magnon-photon coupling increases photon intensity and decreases magnon intensity, because of photon and magnon energy exchange, leading to enhanced photon bistablity and decreased magnon bistability. However, in case of increasing strength of traveling field, both photon as well as magnon bistability is appeared to be decreasing. We also study the steady-state effective potential of the system and illustrate the occurrence of bistability with nonlinear interactions between contour trajectories, which similarly depends on the PT broken configuration of the system.

The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.

    "abstract": "           Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing.

To this end, we first developed a four-level rate equation model that simulates the optical pumping of Rf$^+$ from its ground state, $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), to the metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) state via laser resonant excitation of the intermediate $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^1$7p$^1$) state prior to electronic state chromatography. This model predicts a 93% pumping efficiency that suffices to enable efficient laser resonance chromatography of this ion. We then performed accurate relativistic Multi-Reference Configuration-Interaction (MRCI) calculations to model the interaction of Rf$^+$ with He in the ground $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), low-lying $^2$D$_{5/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), and metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) states. These ion-atom interaction potentials were used to calculate the state-specific ion mobilities. For gas temperatures above 100 K and small applied electric fields, the reduced ion mobilities of the ground and metastable states differ significantly. In particular, at room temperature the difference between the reduced ion mobilities of these states is larger than 11%, and as such sufficiently large to ensure LRC of this ion.         ",

To address this issue, here we report a biofluid mimetic that can be leveraged to specifically study competitive displacement of oligonucleotides from NBEs, a critical sensor degradation pathway. Using this mimetic, we demonstrate three strategies that drastically mitigate competitive displacement and improve sensor stability in vitro. A combination of these strategies also improves sensor stability in vivo, demonstrated here via sensors emplaced in the brain cortex of live rats.         ",

    "abstract": "           The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz is a promising tool for achieving high-precision results using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the NISQ era. However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.         ",

    "abstract": "           Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.         ",

    "abstract": "           Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present the basic design of a large, light weight, spaceborne antenna for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (space-VLBI) mission, achieving high efficiency operation at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. An introductory overview of the mission and its science background are provided. The BHEX mission targets fundamental black hole physics enabled by the detection of the finely structured image feature around black holes known as the photon ring, theoretically expected due to light orbiting the black hole before reaching the observer. Interferometer baselines much longer than an earth diameter are necessary to attain the spatial resolution required to detect the photon ring, leading to a space component. The science goals require high sensitivity observations at mm/sub-mm wavelengths, placing stringent constraints on antenna performance. The design approach described, seeks to balance the antenna aperture, volume and mass constraints of the NASA Explorers mission opportunity profile and the desired high performance. A 3.5 m aperture with a 40 $\\mu$m surface rms is targeted. Currently, a symmetric, dual reflector, axially displaced ellipse (Gregorian ring focus) optical design and metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction have been chosen to deliver high efficiency and light weight. Further exploration of design choices and parameter space and reflector shaping studies are in progress         ",
