    "abstract": "           In order to investigate whether the radical pair mechanism (RPM) can explain the effects of telecommunication frequency radiation on reactive oxygen species production, we modelled the effects of oscillating magnetic fields on radical pair systems. Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the biological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due to negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental setups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require hyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that far exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude that some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of telecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Pockels effect is essential for controlling optical signals at the highest speeds. We present the first measurements of the Pockels coefficients and permittivity in lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) over a continuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO ($\\varepsilon$ = 1136, $r_{42}$ = 481 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 125 pm/V at 100 MHz, $\\varepsilon$ = 453, $r_{42}$ = 191 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 60 pm/V at 330 GHz) has remarkably large electro-optic properties compared to LN ($\\varepsilon$ = 27, $r_{42}$ = 15 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 27 pm/V). Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work is foundational to designing high-speed BTO devices and to developing new electro-optic materials.         ",

    "abstract": "           The contribution of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) to the properties of various hydrogen-bound systems, including biomolecules, is increasingly recognized. Despite the development of many acceleration techniques, the computational overhead of incorporating NQEs in complex systems is sizable, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we leverage deep learning and multiscale coarse-graining techniques to mitigate the computational burden of path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Specifically, we employ a machine-learned potential to accurately represent corrections to classical potentials, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost of simulating NQEs. We validate our approach using four distinct systems: Morse potential, Zundel cation, single water molecule, and bulk water. Our framework allows us to accurately compute position-dependent static properties, as demonstrated by the excellent agreement obtained between the machine-learned potential and computationally intensive PIMD calculations, even in the presence of strong NQEs. This approach opens the way to the development of transferable machine-learned potentials capable of accurately reproducing NQEs in a wide range of molecular systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Plasmonic nanoantennas with suitable far-field characteristics are of huge interest for utilization in optical wireless links, inter-/intra-chip communications, LiDARs, and photonic integrated circuits due to their exceptional modal confinement. Despite its success in shaping robust antenna design theories in radio frequency and millimeter-wave regimes, conventional transmission line theory finds its validity diminished in the optical frequencies, leading to a noticeable void in a generalized theory for antenna design in the optical domain. By utilizing neural networks and through a one-time training of the network, one can transform the plasmonic nanoantennas design into an automated, data-driven task. In this work, we have developed a multi-head deep convolutional neural network serving as an efficient inverse-design framework for plasmonic patch nanoantennas. Our framework is designed with the main goal of determining the optimal geometries of nanoantennas to achieve the desired (inquired by the designer) S 11 and radiation pattern simultaneously. The proposed approach preserves the one-to-many mappings, enabling us to generate diverse designs. In addition, apart from the primary fabrication limitations that were considered while generating the dataset, further design and fabrication constraints can also be applied after the training process. In addition to possessing an exceptionally rapid surrogate solver capable of predicting S 11 and radiation patterns throughout the entire design frequency spectrum, we are introducing what we believe to be the pioneering inverse design network.

However, the intricate relationship between surface error and imaging quality poses significant challenges, necessitating dense sampling of featured rays during the computation process to ensure an accurate tolerance for different fields of view (FOVs). Here, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy called \"Critical Ray Aiming\" for surface tolerance analysis. By identifying the most sensitive ray to wave aberration at each surface point, our methodology facilitates flexible sampling of the FOVs and entrance pupil (EP), achieving computational efficiency without compromising accuracy in determining tolerable surface error.

We report the measurement and characterization of the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two CRAs, individually trapped in optical tweezers, and find excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate a dynamic control over the strength of the interaction by tuning the orientation of an electric field. We use the interaction between the CRAs as a meter for the interatomic distance, and record the relative motion between two atoms in their traps. This motion, that we induce through the interaction between Rydberg levels with permanent electric dipoles, transiently populated during the preparation of the circular states, is a signature of spin-motion coupling.

Here, we study the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and Lorentzian medium-based dispersive photonic time crystals (PTCs). We demonstrate that a stationary charge embedded in the PTCs can excite these longitudinal modes through the conversion of the static polarization field induced by the charge. Furthermore, the PTCs can develop a momentum bandgap across the entire wave vector space to amplify the longitudinal modes. Remarkably, this infinite momentum bandgap can be established with minimal temporal modulation of the refractive index when creating the PTCs. Our approach expands the range of waves that can be manipulated in PTCs and shows potential for observing momentum bandgap phenomenon in realistic optical experiments, where the modulation depth of the refractive index is severely constrained.

The propagation direction of each CZM is determined by both the applied magnetic field and the topological charge of the singularity point. While counter-propagating CZMs have been observed in 2D and 3D systems, the realization of co-propagating CZMs has remained elusive. Here we present the first experimental observation of co-propagating CZMs in magnetic photonic crystals hosting a single pair of ideal Weyl points WPs. By manipulating the crystal's structural configuration, we spatially alter the locations of the WPs, creating pseudo-magnetic fields in opposite directions between them. This arrangement results in a pair of CZMs that possess the same group velocity and co-propagate.

For a closed system dynamics, we confirmed the equivalence of the dynamics in the Hilbert space and the Liouville space numerically. We also conducted open system quantum dynamics calculation by generalizing the ME to the non-Hermitian dynamics in the Liouville space for the case where the effects of photonic bath are represented by Lindblad operators. In both cases, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was assessed. We found significant errors of RWA during initial stages of the dynamics for representative cases where electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population trapping can be observed. The presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics reduces the errors of RWA, but significant errors for off-diagonal elements of the density operator can still be seen. We also found that approaches to steady state limits of exact dynamics are slower than those for RWA. These results demonstrate the utility of the ME as a general and reliable tool for closed and open system quantum dynamics for time dependent Hamiltonians, and expose potential issues of drawing conclusions based solely on RWA.

    "title": "Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and higher-order counter-propagating SPDC",
    "abstract": "           Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the wavelengths which are inter-converted. Here we investigate the noise spectrum of a frequency converter pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a monolithic bulk pump enhancement cavity made from a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal - quasi-phase-matched for the conversion of 637 nm to 1587 nm. In the range from 1140 nm to 1330 nm (up to 60 THz from the pump) Stokes-Raman resonances can be identified as the dominant noise source while the noise in the range from 1330 nm to 1650 nm can be attributed mainly to parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Further, a succession of narrow-band peaks is observed in the spectrum originating from higher-order counter-propagating SPDC. Both types of counter-propagation, where either the lower-energy idler photon or the higher-energy signal photon counter-propagate relative to the pump beam, are observed, with narrow-band peaks corresponding to 10th to 44th order quasi-phase-matching.

    "abstract": "           Optical quantum communication technologies are making the prospect of unconditionally secure and efficient information transfer a reality. The possibility of generating and reliably detecting quantum states of light, with the further need of increasing the private data-rate is where most research efforts are focusing. The physical concept of entanglement is a solution guaranteeing the highest degree of security in device-independent schemes, yet its implementation and preservation over long communication links is hard to achieve. Lithium niobate-on-insulator has emerged as a revolutionising platform for high-speed classical telecommunication and is equally suited for quantum information applications owing to the large second-order nonlinearities that can efficiently produce entangled photon pairs. In this work, we generate maximally entangled quantum states in the time-bin basis using lithium niobate-on-insulator photonics at the fibre optics telecommunication wavelength, and reconstruct the density matrix by quantum tomography on a single photonic integrated circuit. We use on-chip periodically-poled lithium niobate as source of entangled qubits with a brightness of 242 MHz/mW and perform quantum tomography with a fidelity of 91.9+-1.0 %. Our results, combined with the established large electro-optic bandwidth of lithium niobate, showcase the platform as perfect candidate to realise fibre-coupled, high-speed time-bin quantum communication modules that exploit entanglement to achieve information security.

    "abstract": "           Modern quantum technologies using matter are designed as closed quantum systems to isolate them from interactions with the environment. This design paradigm greatly constrains the scalability and limits practical implementation of such systems. Here, we introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Deepening the understanding of interface-type Resistive Switching (RS) in metal/oxide heterojunctions is a key step for the development of high-performance memristors and Schottky rectifiers. In this study, we address the role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Ultrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal (001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by conventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly reversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization. Room-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier height $\\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and ideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains almost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping and of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient air exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial homogeneity of $\\phi_B$(<50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO mixed termination (|$\\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|<35meV). Experimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD metallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This occurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to the creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas species affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows to rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure to ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper it is shown that the correct mathematical framework of combined polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent losses (combined PMD-PDL effects or impairments) in optical fibers is the irreducible spinor representation of the extended Lorentz Group. Combined PMD-PDL effects are shown to be formally identical to Lorentz Transformations acting on spin 1/2 zero mass particles. Since there are two different irreducible spinor representations of the restricted Lorentz Group, there must also exist two kinds of states of polarizations (SOPs) that are relevant in the description of PMD-PDL effects. The optical process that allows to convert one kind into the other is identified as optical phase conjugation. Optical phase conjugation plays the same role as the time inversion operator in the Lorentz Group representation theory. A practical and extremely important example of utility of these ideas, a technique that significantly reduces the PMD-PDL induced impairments, is presented. This technique allows to cancel the PDL part of the combined PMD-PDL impairments in a very simple and straightforward way.         ",

Then it points out that bivalent semantics for quantum logic - compatible with realism about quantum mechanics - can be maintained, albeit at the price of truth-functionality. Finally, but more importantly, the paper significantly improves on Hellman's argument (1980) that this lack of truth-functionality entails a change of meaning between classical and quantum connectives.

    "abstract": "           We demonstrate how to measure in situ for heading errors of optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in the challenging parameter regime of compact vapor cells with imperfect optical pumping and high buffer gas pressure. For this, we utilize microwave-driven Ramsey and Rabi frequency spectroscopy (FS) to independently characterize scalar heading errors in free induction decay (FID) signals. Both of these approaches suppress 5-nT inaccuracies in geomagnetic fields caused by nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) shifts in FID measurements to below 0.6 nT. For Ramsey FS, we implement short periods of microwave interrogation within a $\\pi/2-t_R-3\\pi/2$ Ramsey interferometry sequence, effectively circumventing systematic errors from off-resonant driving. Conversely, Rabi FS leverages an atom-microwave Hamiltonian for accurate modeling of Rabi oscillation frequencies, achieving a measurement precision down to 80 pT$/ \\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ that is limited primarily by technical microwave noise. We show that the fundamental sensitivity of Rabi FS is 30 pT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ with our vapor cell parameters through a Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis. This work paves the way for future investigations into the accuracy of hyperfine structure (HFS) magnetometry and contributes to the broader applicability of OPMs in fields ranging from navigation and geophysics to space exploration and unexploded ordinance detection, where heading error mitigation is essential.

    "title": "Explicit Abnormality Extraction for Unsupervised Motion Artifact Reduction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging",
    "abstract": "           Motion artifacts compromise the quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pose challenges to achieving diagnostic outcomes and image-guided therapies. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches have emerged as successful solutions for motion artifact reduction (MAR). One disadvantage of these methods is their dependency on acquiring paired sets of motion artifact-corrupted (MA-corrupted) and motion artifact-free (MA-free) MR images for training purposes. Obtaining such image pairs is difficult and therefore limits the application of supervised training. In this paper, we propose a novel UNsupervised Abnormality Extraction Network (UNAEN) to alleviate this problem. Our network is capable of working with unpaired MA-corrupted and MA-free images. It converts the MA-corrupted images to MA-reduced images by extracting abnormalities from the MA-corrupted images using a proposed artifact extractor, which intercepts the residual artifact maps from the MA-corrupted MR images explicitly, and a reconstructor to restore the original input from the MA-reduced images. The performance of UNAEN was assessed by experimenting with various publicly available MRI datasets and comparing them with state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of UNAEN over alternative MAR methods and visually exhibits fewer residual artifacts. Our results substantiate the potential of UNAEN as a promising solution applicable in real-world clinical environments, with the capability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate image-guided therapies.

We propose a scenario in which the second order intra-band process is nonzero while the inter-band process is zero. This occurs for a band structure with momentum asymmetry in the Brillouin zone. Very low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model. We confirm that the Kramers-Kronig relations break down for the limit case of ($\\omega$, $-\\omega$) in the nonlinear optical conductivity. Finally, we calculate the superconducting transition temperature of NbN and the dielectric function of AlN, and the resistance of the NbN/AlN junction. The natural non-linearity of the Josephson junction brings a Josephson plasma with frequency in the Terahertz region.         ",

    "abstract": "           On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 1 m, entering the atmosphere at 40.4 km$\\,$s$^{-1}$ with an average slope of 8.5$^\\circ$. The luminous phase started at 133 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit had an inclination of 16.4$^\\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.952, a semi-major axis of 2.4 au, and a short perihelion distance of 0.12 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) and the European Space Agency (ESA), as well as by the U.S. Government (USG) sensors from space. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 0.56$^\\circ$ and 0.1 km$\\,$s$^{-1}$, respectively. The presence of detached fragments in the lower part of the luminous trajectory suggests that the meteoroid was a polymict carbonaceous chondrite, containing higher-strength macroscopic particles in its interior due to collisional gardening, or a thermally processed C-type asteroid. The orbital elements indicate that the most likely source is the Jupiter-Family Comet (JFC) region, aligning with the SOHO comet family, as its sunskirting orbit is decoupled from Jupiter. This event provides important information to characterize the disruption mechanism of near-Sun objects.         ",
