    "abstract": "           The increasing velocity and frequency of space missions necessitate advancements in spacecraft protection technologies to ensure mission success and the safety of onboard systems and personnel. Existing shielding solutions, including electromagnetic shields, plasma shields, and speculative force fields, each offer distinct protective capabilities but are limited when used independently. This study proposes an integrated deflector shield system that combines the strengths of these technologies to provide comprehensive protection against a wide range of spaceborne threats, including charged particles, micrometeoroids, and high-energy radiation. By leveraging fusion energy as a primary power source, we aim to sustain a high-energy shield capable of dynamically adjusting to varying threat levels. Extensive theoretical modeling, simulations, and analytical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of this integrated approach, highlighting significant improvements in energy efficiency and scalability. The implementation of this multi-layered shield system marks a pivotal advancement in spacecraft protection, paving the way for safer and more reliable space exploration missions.         ",

    "abstract": "           We consider the design of cascaded diffractive optical elements (DOEs) for generating specified intensity distributions for several incident beams with different wavelengths. For each incident beam with a given wavelength, the cascaded DOE forms a different specified intensity distribution. The problem of DOE design is formulated as the problem of minimizing a functional that depends on the functions of diffractive microrelief height of the cascaded DOE and represents the deviations of the intensity distributions generated at the operating wavelengths from the specified ones. Explicit expressions are obtained for the derivatives of the functional, and on this basis, a gradient method for calculating a cascaded DOE is formulated. The proposed gradient method is used for the calculation of cascaded DOEs focusing radiation of three different wavelengths into different areas. In particular, the calculation of a cascaded DOE generating a complex color image of parrots is considered. The presented numerical simulation results demonstrate high performance of the proposed method.         ",

They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.

Here, we report the generation of light-induced quantum tunnelling current in graphene phototransistors by ultrafast laser pulses in an ambient environment. This tunnelling effect provides access to the instantaneous field-driven current to demonstrate the current switching (ON and OFF) on a 630 attosecond (1.6 petahertz speed).

Furthermore, we exploited this capability to demonstrate various logic gates. The demonstrated light-induced tunnelling current and ultrafast switching were attained under standard room temperature and pressure conditions. Therefore, the presented scientific advancement in this work is at the technology readiness level suitable for its immediate integration into the development of ultrafast, nearly six orders of magnitude faster, optical transistors, lightwave electronics, and optical quantum computers.

    "abstract": "           Microwave electric (MW) field measurements utilizing Rydberg atoms have witnessed significant advancements, achieving remarkable sensitivity, albeit limited to discrete MW frequencies resonant with Rydberg states. Recently, various continuous-frequency measurement schemes have emerged. However, when the MW detuning surpasses 1 GHz, the sensitivity degrades by over an order of magnitude compared to resonant measurements. In this paper, we successfully extend the response frequency range by harnessing a controlled driving field in conjunction with a quantum mixer and heterodyne technology, theoretically enabling infinite scalability. Notably, second-order effects stemming from quantum mixing necessitate careful consideration to ensure accurate electric field measurements. In addition, compared to resonant measurements, the sensitivity decline for far-detuned MW fields exceeding 1 GHz is less than twice, representing a significant improvement of several orders of magnitude over alternative schemes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of far-detuned MW fields can be efficiently enhanced by augmenting the intensity and frequency of the controlled field. For detunings ranging from 100 MHz to 2 GHz, we present optimal sensitivity values and the corresponding methods to achieve them. Our findings pave the way for Rydberg atom-based MW receivers characterized by both high sensitivity and an exceptionally broad bandwidth.         ",

Phase modulation of the two photons reveals nonlocal correlations in excellent agreement with theory: in-phase modulation produces additional sidebands in the joint spectral intensity, while out-of-phase modulation is nonlocally canceled.

In the absence of linear coupling, the relative pump phase does not affect counterpropagating intraresonator intensities, and two asymmetric states arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrariwise, in the presence of weak linear intermode coupling, the asymmetry of the states is deterministically controlled via changes in phase (for all phases except 0 and $\\pi$). Spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero phase is suppressed when the linear intermode coupling is increased, while for the $\\pi$ phase it can be enhanced, so that the overall threshold for the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be significantly lower for nonzero linear coupling. These results are important for fundamental understanding of the processes in Kerr resonators and other systems with Kerr-like nonlinearities and linear intermode coupling and have high prospects for the development of photonic devices such as ultrasensitive sensors.

This means that when using a standard microscope, any minor movement of the object along the optical axis can cause the image to become blurry. To address this issue, we exploit inverse design techniques to optimise a phase mask which, when inserted into a standard microscope, extends the depth of field by a factor of approximately four without compromising the microscope's resolution. Differentiable Fourier optics simulations allow us to rapidly iterate towards an optimised design in a hybrid fashion, starting with gradient-free Bayesian optimisation and proceeding to a local gradient-based optimisation. To fabricate the device, a commercial two-photon 3D laser nanoprinter is used, in combination with a two-step pre-compensation routine, providing high fabrication speed and much better than subwavelength accuracy. We find excellent agreement between our numerical predictions and the measurements upon integrating the phase mask into a microscope and optically characterising selected samples. The phase mask enables us to conduct simultaneous multiplane imaging of objects separated by distances that cannot be achieved with the original microscope.         ",

This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\\sim 250$ long-slit grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor). This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| < 3 uT.         ",

Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\u00f6dinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.         ",
