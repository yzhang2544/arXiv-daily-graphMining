    "abstract": "           The terahertz (THz) frequency range, bridging the gap between microwave and infrared frequencies, presents unparalleled opportunities for advanced imaging, sensing, communications, and spectroscopy applications. Terahertz photonics, in analogy with microwave photonics, is a promising solution to address the critical challenges in THz technologies through optical methods. Despite its vast potential, key technical challenges remain in effectively interfacing THz signals with the optical domain, especially THz-optic modulation and optical generation of THz waves. Here, we address these challenges using a monolithic integrated photonic chip designed to support efficient bidirectional interaction between THz and optical waves. Leveraging the significant second-order optical nonlinearity and strong optical and THz confinement in a thin-film lithium niobate on quartz platform, the chip supports both efficient THz-optic modulation and continuous THz wave generation at up to 500 GHz. The THz-optic modulator features a radio frequency (RF) half-wave voltage of 8V at 500 GHz, representing more than an order of magnitude reduction in modulation power consumption from previous works. The measured continuous wave THz generation efficiency of 4.8*10-6 /W at 500 GHz also marks a tenfold improvement over existing tunable THz generation devices based on lithium niobate. We further leverage the coherent nature of the optical THz generation process and mature optical modulation techniques to realize high-speed electro-THz modulation at frequencies up to 35 GHz. The chip-scale THz-photonic platform paves the way for more compact, efficient, and cost-effective THz systems with potential applications in THz communications, remote sensing, and spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "           Due to its exceptional dimensional stability in harsh thermal conditions and excellent mechanical and optical properties, Corning ultra-low expansion (ULE) glass is the material of choice in many high-demanding fields such as aerospace, astronomy, and advanced optics. This material has recently attracted renewed attention with the advent of femtosecond laser technology, with a particular focus on the interaction of ultrafast pulses and the material itself. Phenomena like the formation of self-assembled nanogratings and their thermal stability as well as the darkening of laser-affected zones have then been characterized. This paper presents how to exploit femtosecond selective laser etching (SLE) techniques to manufacture truly three-dimensional (3D) components. To demonstrate the micron-scale accuracy and repeatability of this process from the mm- to the cm-size range, various devices are designed and fabricated: fiber hole arrays with different hole densities, sizes, orientations, and shapes; and fiber V-groove arrays. Additionally, a mechanical flexural fiber mount is presented as an example of how multiple functionalities can be monolithically integrated into a single piece of glass through SLE technology. An example of a passive alignment substrate for optical components is also shown. SLE technique represents a new advancement in the field of microscale manufacturing, enabling the scalable production of custom-designed ULE glass structures with unprecedented precision and complexity, paving the way for the miniaturized integration of highly stable components.

We address this device variability by fabricating PhCCs as releasable pixels that can be transferred from their native substrate to a receiver where ordered micro-assembly can overcome the inherent fabrication variance. We demonstrate the measurement, binning and transfer of 119 PhCCs in a single session, producing spatially ordered arrays of PhCCs, sorted by resonant wavelength. Furthermore, the rapid in-situ measurement of the devices enables measurements of the PhCCs dynamic response to the print process for the first time, showing plastic and elastic effects in the seconds to hours range.

    "abstract": "           Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. However, closing these gaps via a strong ``counterfactual'' reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of each of quantum incompleteness, determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Consequences for quantum interpretations are briefly discussed.         ",

One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.         ",

The Al substrates were either wrought or cold sprayed, to comprehend their prospective influence on the Fe coatings build-up. SAM was then used to assess morphological properties of the materials from the cross-view and top-view directions. The microstructure below the surface of the studied samples was visualized by measuring the amplitudes of the reflection echoes and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The SAM analysis revealed that the regions of coating imperfections around the grooves are larger than what is suggested by standard scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Furthermore, we found that the seemingly non-influenced coating regions that appear perfectly homogeneous and dense in SEM do, in fact, possess heterogeneous microstructure associated with the individual CS nozzle passes.

However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           The application of quantum algorithms to classical problems is generally accompanied by significant bottlenecks when transferring data between quantum and classical states, often negating any intrinsic quantum advantage. Here we address this challenge for a well-known algorithm for linear systems of equations, originally proposed by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL), by adapting it into a predictor-corrector instead of a direct solver. Rather than seeking the solution at the next time step, the goal now becomes determining the change between time steps. This strategy enables the intelligent omission of computationally costly steps commonly found in many classical algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the notorious readout problems associated with extracting solutions from a quantum state. Random or regularly performed skips instead lead to simulation failure. We demonstrate that our methodology secures a useful polynomial advantage over a conventional application of the HHL algorithm. The practicality and versatility of the approach are illustrated through applications in various fields such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, plasma simulations, and reactive flow configurations. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is well suited to run asynchronously on future heterogeneous hardware infrastructures and can effectively leverage the synergistic strengths of classical as well as quantum compute resources.

    "abstract": "           Optical tweezers revolutionized the manipulation of nanoscale objects. Typically, tunable manipulations of optical tweezers rely on adjusting either the trapping laser beams or the optical environment surrounding the nanoparticles. We present a novel approach to achieve tunable and switchable trapping using nanoparticles made of a phase-change material (vanadium dioxide or VO$_2$). By varying the intensity of the trapping beam, we induce transitions of the VO$_2$ between monoclinic and rutile phases. Depending on the nanoparticles' sizes, they exhibit one of three behaviours: small nanoparticles (in our settings, radius $<0.12$ wavelength $\\lambda$) remain always attracted by the laser beam in both material phases, large nanoparticles ($>0.22 \\lambda$) remain always repelled. However, within the size range of $0.12$-$0.22 \\lambda$, the phase transition of the VO$_2$ switches optical forces between attractive and repulsive, thereby pulling/pushing them towards/away from the beam centre. The effect is reversible, allowing the same particle to be attracted and repelled repeatedly. The phenomenon is governed by Mie resonances supported by the nanoparticle and their alterations during the phase transition of the VO$_2$. This work provides an alternative solution for dynamic optical tweezers and paves a way to new possibilities, including optical sorting, light-driven optomechanics and single-molecule biophysics.

Here, we robustly estimate the free Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic excitations in a superconducting-qubit analog quantum simulator from measured time-series of single-mode canonical coordinates. We achieve high levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian parameters by exploiting a priori knowledge, making it robust against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Importantly, we are also able to obtain tomographic information about those SPAM errors from the same data, crucial for the experimental applicability of Hamiltonian learning in dynamical quantum-quench experiments. Our learning algorithm is scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique coined tensorESPRIT for frequency extraction from matrix time-series. The algorithm then combines tensorESPRIT with constrained manifold optimization for the eigenspace reconstruction with pre- and post-processing stages. For up to 14 coupled superconducting qubits on two Sycamore processors, we identify the Hamiltonian parameters -- verifying the implementation on one of them up to sub-MHz precision -- and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits.

Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O($3$) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.
