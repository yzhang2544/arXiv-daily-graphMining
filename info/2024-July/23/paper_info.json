    "abstract": "           We propose a heuristic model of the universe as a growing quasicrystal projected from a higher-dimensional lattice. By extending the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle in a box with time-dependent boundaries, we derive an equation that resembles the Friedmann equation, addressing the Hubble tension. This model incorporates phonons and phasons, providing insights into cosmic-scale dynamics and the universe's expansion. We outline a pre-inflation tiling space phase with quantum error correction, a radiation phase dominated by quasiparticles, and a post-radiation phase with the emergence of matter. Our hypothesis, which posits that the universe is a growing quasicrystal, suggests that the necessity for an inflationary period may be obviated. Furthermore, phonon arising from this quasicrystalline structure could act as dark matter, influencing the dynamics of ordinary matter while remaining mostly undetectable by electromagnetic interactions. This hypothesis draws parallels with other crystalline matter at atomic scales that are fundamentally quantum in nature. We also explore how the notion of tiling space can support continuous symmetry atop a discrete structure, providing a novel framework for understanding the universe's expansion and underlying structure. Consequently, it is logical to start with quantum mechanics as the foundation of our model. Further development could enhance our understanding of cosmic expansion and the underlying structure of the universe.         ",

Summarizing all possible trajectories in conventional path integral quantum mechanics can be transformed into the summation of all possible spacetime metrics. We emphasize that in conventional quantum gravity, it is possible that the classical matter fields correspond to the quantum spacetime.

The ultimate goal of encompassing atomistic to mesoscopic length scales in the same nonequilibrium device simulation approach has traditionally been challenging due to the computational cost of high-fidelity coupled multiphysics and multiscale requirements. In this work, we present ELEQTRONeX (ELEctrostatic Quantum TRansport modeling Of Nanomaterials at eXascale), a massively-parallel GPU-accelerated framework for self-consistently solving the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and electrostatics in complex device geometries. By customizing algorithms for GPU multithreading, we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in computational time, and excellent scaling on up to 512 GPUs and billions of spatial grid cells. We validate our code by computing band structures, current-voltage characteristics, conductance, and drain-induced barrier lowering for various 3D configurations of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors. We also demonstrate that ELEQTRONeX is suitable for complex device/material geometries where periodic approaches are not feasible, such as modeling of arrays of misaligned carbon nanotubes requiring fully 3D simulations.

However, little research has been done on the design and impact on participants of workforce preparation efforts outside of R1 contexts. In order to begin to answer the question of how program design can or should attend to the needs and interests of diverse groups of students, we performed interviews with students from two Colorado-based quantum education/workforce development programs, one in an undergraduate R1 setting and one in a distributed community setting and serving students largely from two-year colleges. Through analysis of these interviews, we were able to highlight differences between the student populations in the two programs in terms of participation goals, prior and general awareness of quantum science, and career interest and framing of career trajectories. While both groups of students reported benefits from program participation, we highlight the ways in which students' different needs and contexts have informed divergent development of the two programs, framing contextual design of quantum education and workforce efforts as an issue of equity and representation for the burgeoning quantum workforce.

    "abstract": "           A fundamental challenge in endoscopy is how to fabricate a small fiber-optic probe that can achieve comparable function to probes with large, complicated optics (e.g., high resolution and extended depth of focus). To achieve high resolution over an extended depth of focus (DOF), the application of needle-like beams has been proposed. However, existing methods using miniaturized needle beam designs fail to adequately correct astigmatism and other monochromatic aberrations, limiting the resolution of at least one axis. Here, we describe a novel approach to realize freeform beam-shaping endoscopic probes via two-photon direct laser writing, also known as micro 3D-printing. We present a design achieving approximately 8-micron resolution with a DOF of >0.8 mm at a central wavelength of 1310 nm. The probe has a diameter of 0.25 mm (without the catheter sheaths) and is fabricated using a single printing step directly on the optical fiber. We demonstrate our device in intravascular imaging of living atherosclerotic pigs at multiple time points, as well as human arteries with plaques ex vivo. This is the first step to enable beam-tailoring endoscopic probes which achieve diffraction-limited resolution over a large DOF.         ",

    "abstract": "           Materials with electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in the terahertz (THz) regime, while minimizing the quantity used, are highly demanded for future information communication, healthcare and mineral resource exploration applications. Currently, there is often a trade-off between the amount of material used and the absolute EMI shielding effectiveness (EESt) for the EMI shielding materials. Here, we address this trade-off by harnessing the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) beta12-borophene (beta12-Br) nanosheets. Leveraging beta12-Br's light weight and exceptional electron mobility characteristics, which represent among the highest reported values to date, we simultaneously achieve a THz EMI shield effectiveness (SE) of 70 dB and an EESt of 4.8E5 dB cm^2/g (@0.87 THz) using a beta12-Br polymer composite. This surpasses the values of previously reported THz shielding materials with an EESt less than 3E5 dB cm^2/g and a SE smaller than 60 dB, while only needs 0.1 wt.% of these materials to realize the same SE value. Furthermore, by capitalizing on the composite's superior mechanical properties, with 158% tensile strain at a Young's modulus of 33 MPa, we demonstrate the high-efficiency shielding performances of conformably coated surfaces based on beta12-Br nanosheets, suggesting their great potential in EMI shielding area.

    "abstract": "           Laser synchronization is a technique that locks the wavelength of a free-running laser to that of the reference laser, thereby enabling synchronous changes in the wavelengths of the two lasers. This technique is of crucial importance in both scientific and industrial applications. Conventional synchronization systems, whether digital or analog, have intrinsic limitations in terms of accuracy or bandwidth. The hybrid \"digital + analog\" system can address this shortcoming. However, all above systems face the challenge of achieving an both high locking accuracy and low structural complexity simultaneously. This paper presents a hybrid \"digital + analog\" laser synchronization system with low-complexity and high-performance. In the digital part, we proposed a electric intensity locking method based on a band-pass filter, which realizes the fluctuation of frequency offset between a single frequency laser (SFL) and a mode-locked laser (MLL) less than 350 kHz in 24 hours. Following the incorporation of the analog control component, frequency fluctuation is less than 2.5 Hz in 24 hours. By synchronizing two SFLs to a repetition-frequency locked MLL, we achieve indirect synchronization between SFLs with a frequency offset of 10.6 GHz and fluctuation less than 5 Hz in 24 hours, demonstrating robust long- and short-term stability. Since the MLL is employed as a reference, the system can be utilized for cross-band indirect synchronization of multiple lasers. Based on the synchronization system, we propose a photonic-assisted microwave frequency identification scheme, which has detection error of less than 0.6 MHz. The high performance of the synchronization system enables the proposed frequency identification scheme to achieve high measurement accuracy and a theoretically large frequency range.         ",

BOCDR achieves spatial resolution through frequency modulation of the laser output, and this modulation frequency determines the measurement position, necessitating accurate association of modulation frequencies with positions on the FUT. However, a practical method to precisely correlate modulation frequency values with FUT positions has not yet been proposed.

The narrow linewidth lasing is achieved with an extended cavity consisting of a resonator-based Vernier mirror and a phase shifter. Utilizing synchronous tuning of the integrated heaters, we show mode-hop-free wavelength tuning over a range larger than 100 GHz (200 pm). To demonstrate the potential of the device, we investigate two illustrative applications: (i) the linear characterization of a silicon nitride microresonator designed for entangled-photon pair generation, and (ii) the absorption spectroscopy and locking to the D1 and D2 transition lines of 87-Rb.

These gravitational quantum states (GQS) were so far only observed with neutrons. However, the existence of GQS is predicted also for atoms.

This endeavor is motivated by the higher densities, which can be expected from hydrogen compared to neutrons, the easier access, the fact, that GQS were never observed with atoms and the accessibility to hypothetical short range interactions. In addition to enabling gravitational quantum spectroscopy, such a cryogenic hydrogen beam with very low vertical velocity components - a few cm s$^{-1}$, can be used for precision optical and microwave spectroscopy. In this article, we report on our methods developed to reduce background and to detect atoms with a low horizontal velocity, which are needed for such an experiment. Our recent measurement results on the collimation of the hydrogen beam to 2 mm, the reduction of background and improvement of signal-to-noise and finally our first detection of atoms with velocities < 72 m s$^{-1}$ are presented.

However, a thorough analysis on the historical development of QM attributes the origin of quantum statistics, in particular, Bose-Einstein statistics, to a lack of statistical independence of the micro-states of identical quantum entities. We have recently identified Bose-Einstein statistics in the combination of words in large texts, as a consequence of the entanglement created by the meaning carried by words when they combine in human language. Relying on this investigation, we put forward the hypothesis that entanglement, hence the lack of statistical independence, is due to a mechanism of contextual updating, which provides deeper reasons for the appearance of Bose-Einstein statistics in human language. However, this investigation also contributes to a better understanding of the origin of quantum mechanical statistics in physics.

This was achieved via optical-IR spectroscopy of a laser-produced Au plasma, with an Au target of high purity (99.95 %) and a low vacuum pressure to remove any air contamination from the experimental spectra. Our data were recorded with a spectrometer of 750 mm focal length and 1200 lines mm-1 grating, yielding a resolution of 0.04 nm. We find 54 lines not previously identified and which are not due to the impurities (principally copper (Cu) and silver (Ag)) in our Au sample. Of these 54 lines, we provisionally match 21 strong transitions to theoretical results from collisional-radiative models that include energy levels derived from atomic structure calculations up to the 6s level. Some of the remaining 33 unidentified lines in our spectra are also strong and may be due to transitions involving energy levels which are higher-lying than those in our plasma models. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that laser-produced plasmas are well suited to the identification of transitions in r-process elements, with the method applicable to spectra ranging from UV to IR wavelengths.

    "abstract": "           Li-containing argyrodites represent a promising family of Li-ion conductors with several derived compounds exhibiting room-temperature ionic conductivity > 1 mS/cm and making them attractive as potential candidates as electrolytes in solid-state Li-ion batteries. Starting from the parent phase Li7PS6, several cation and anion substitution strategies have been attempted to increase the conductivity of Li ions. Nonetheless, a detailed understanding of the thermodynamics of native defects and doping of Li argyrodite and their effect on the ionic conductivity of Li is missing. Here, we report a comprehensive computational study of defect chemistry of the parent phase Li7PS6 in both intrinsic and extrinsic regimes, using a newly developed workflow to automate the computations of several defect formation energies in a thermodynamically consistent framework. Our findings agree with known experimental findings, rule out several unfavorable aliovalent dopants, narrowing down the potential promising candidates that can be tested experimentally. We also find that cation-anion co-doping can provide a powerful strategy to further optimize the composition of argyrodite. In particular, Si-F co-doping is predicted to be thermodynamically favorable; this could lead to the synthesis of the first F-doped Li-containing argyrodite. Finally, using DeePMD neural networks, we have mapped the ionic conductivity landscape as function of the concentration of the most promising cation and anion dopants identified from the defect calculations, and identified the most promising region in the compositional space with high Li conductivity that can be explored experimentally.

The stability of system distribution is largely affected by the system--bath interaction strength. We propose that the quantum system exhibits a stable distribution only when its system response function in the frequency domain satisfies $\\tilde\\chi(\\omega = 0+)>0$.

    "abstract": "           Aspera is a NASA Astrophysics Pioneers SmallSat mission designed to study diffuse OVI emission from the warm-hot phase gas in the halos of nearby galaxies. Its payload consists of two identical Rowland Circle-type long-slit spectrographs, sharing a single MicroChannel plate detector. Each spectrograph channel consists of an off-axis parabola primary mirror and a toroidal diffraction grating optimized for the 1013-1057 Angstroms bandpass. Despite the simple configuration, the optical alignment/integration process for Aspera is challenging due to tight optical alignment tolerances, driven by the compact form factor, and the contamination sensitivity of the Far-Ultraviolet optics and detectors. In this paper, we discuss implementing a novel multi-phase approach to meet these requirements using state-of-the-art optical metrology tools. For coarsely positioning the optics we use a blue-laser 3D scanner while the fine alignment is done with a Zygo interferometer and a custom computer-generated hologram. The detector focus requires iterative in-vacuum alignment using a Vacuum UV collimator. The alignment is done in a controlled cleanroom facility at the University of Arizona.         ",

In this paper, we provide an overview of our detector noise characterization test bench that uses delta-doped, photon counting, Electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs) to understand the fundamental noise properties relevant to all silicon CCDs and CMOS arrays. This work attempts to identify the source of the dark current plateau that has been previously measured with photon-counting EMCCDs and is known to be prevalent in other silicon-based arrays. It is suspected that the plateau could be due to a combination of detectable photons in the tail of blackbody radiation of the ambient instrument, low-level light leaks, and a non-temperature-dependent component that varies with substrate voltage. Our innovative test setup delineates the effect of the ambient environment during dark measurements by independently controlling the temperature of the detector and surrounding environment.

    "title": "Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited",
    "abstract": "           F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.         ",

    "abstract": "           Since its invention by Arthur Ashkin and colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1970s, optical micromanipulation, also known as optical tweezers or laser tweezers, has evolved remarkably to become one of the most convenient and versatile tools for studying soft materials, including biological systems. Arthur Ashkin received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for enabling these extraordinary scientific advancements. Essentially, a focused laser beam is used to apply and measure minuscule forces from a few piconewtons to femtonewtons by utilizing light-matter interaction at mesoscopic length scales. Combined with advanced microscopy and position-sensing techniques, optical micromanipulations enable us to investigate diverse aspects of functional soft materials. These include studying mechanical responses through force-elongation measurements, examining the structural properties of complex fluids employing microrheology, analyzing chemical compositions using spectroscopy, and sorting cells through single-cell analysis. Furthermore, it is utilized in various soft-matter-based devices, such as laser scissors and optical motors in microfluidic channels. This chapter presents an overview of optical micromanipulation techniques by describing fundamental theories and explaining the design considerations of conventional single-trap and dual-trap setups as well as recent improvisations. We further discuss their capabilities and applications in probing exotic soft-matter systems and in developing widely utilized devices and technologies based on functional soft materials.         ",

The one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array are then tuned up and its charge configurations are fully mapped out with the two charge sensors. The energy level of each dot in the array can be controlled individually by using a compensated gate architecture (i.e., \"virtual gate\"). After that, four dots in the array are selected to form two double quantum dots and ultra strong inter-double-dot interaction is obtained. A theoretical simulation based on a 4-dimensional Hamiltonian confirms the strong coupling strength between the two double quantum dots.

Currently, physical machine vision schemes detect features linearly, then employ separate digital systems for subsequent nonlinear activation. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using a semiconductor network laser. The system hosts many spatially-overlapping lasing modes which detect multiple image features in parallel via their lasing amplitude. Integrated nonlinearity is provided by antagonistic competition for gain between modes - a photonic analogue of the lateral inhibition in retinal cells. Detected feature maps are fed back through the system, providing multi-layer image classification with intrinsic nonlinear processing.

    "abstract": "           A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \\to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \\to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$, $3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \\to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ and $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \\to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$ transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.

Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.

    "title": "Suppression of noise in separation estimation of optical sources with spatial-mode demultiplexing",
    "abstract": "           Spatial mode demultiplexing was proved to be a successful tool for estimation of the separation between incoherent sources, allowing for sensitivity much below the Rayleigh limit. However, with the presence of measurement's noise, superresolution brought by this technique deteriorates rapidly. On a formal ground, this can be seen in terms of, so called, Rayleigh curse known from direct imaging, which while being absent for ideal spatial mode demultiplexing, goes back in a noisy scenario. In this article, we develop a formal procedure to suppress the destructive effect of the noise, proposing a procedure effectively working as an error correction. For noise models given by a random unitary channel generated by a polynomial of creation and annihilation operators, we demonstrate that perfect noise decoupling can be reached by repeating the mode demultiplexers and intervening them by a group of rotations, in the limit of a large number of repetitions and small noise strength. For a special case of displacement noise, our solution is simplified: by using the demultiplexer twice, and interlacing it by a parity operator, given that the noise configuration is frozen between the first and the second step, a perfect decoupling can be achieved. This allows for a recovery of superresolution for a special class of noise generated by displacement operators. Furthermore, for a strong noise correlation between these two steps, our protocol provides an improved measurement resolution.         ",

    "title": "Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance",
    "abstract": "           We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.         ",

    "abstract": "           Single-pixel cameras are effective solution for imaging outside the visible spectrum where traditional CMOS/CCD cameras have challenges. Combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel visualization can potentially be accelerated using quantum machine learning, thereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work we simulated a single-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images based on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed accuracies of 96% and 95% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite competitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity index measure values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.

    "abstract": "           Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.         ",
