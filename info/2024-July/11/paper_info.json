    "abstract": "           The paper discusses Carnap's claim that a proper philosophical analysis of quantum mechanics, including a determination of whether its logic has to be revised, requires a rational reconstruction of the theory. Several articulations of the notion of rational reconstruction are recalled, followed by a brief analysis of two standard criticisms of Carnap's claim. The paper suggests that adopting inferentialism overcomes both criticisms, and then considers the possibility of formulating quantum mechanics as a Carnapian language with an inferentialist semantics.

    "abstract": "           We create a one-dimensional photonic crystal with strong polarization dependence and tunable by an applied electric field. We accomplish this in a planar microcavity by embedding a cholesteric liquid crystal (LC), which spontaneously forms a uniform lying helix (ULH). The applied voltage controls the orientation of the LC molecules and, consequently, the strength of a polarization-dependent periodic potential. It leads to opening or closing of photonic band gaps in the dispersion of the massive photons in the microcavity. In addition, when the ULH structure possesses a molecular tilt, it induces a spin-orbit coupling between the lattice bands of different parity. This interband spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) is analogous to optical activity and can be treated as a synthetic non-Abelian gauge potential. Finally, we show that doping the LC with dyes allows us to achieve lasing that inherits all the above-mentioned tunable properties of LC microcavity, including dual and circularly-polarized lasing.

    "abstract": "           This paper presents numerical investigations of flow-acoustic resonances in deep and inclined cavities using wall-resolved large eddy simulations. The study focuses on cavity configurations with an aspect ratio of $D/L = 2.632$, subjected to two Mach numbers of $0.2$ and $0.3$ at three different inclination angles ($\\alpha=30^{\\circ}$, $60^{\\circ}$, and $90^{\\circ}$). Fully turbulent boundary layers generated from independent precursor simulations are employed upstream of the cavities. Initial results highlight distinct aeroacoustic responses between inclined and orthogonal cavities, particularly at $M_{\\infty}=0.3$, where inclined cavities exhibit stronger resonances at a lower peak frequency ($St\\approx 0.27$) compared to the orthogonal cavity. Further analysis reveals that this lower Strouhal number corresponds to a reduced vortex convection speed linked to large shear-layer oscillations. Additionally, the acoustic input-output analysis indicates that the inclined cavities amplify acoustic responses more effectively and exhibit weaker source-sink cancellations compared to the orthogonal cavity. These mechanisms are identified as the primary contributors to the enhanced aeroacoustic responses in the inclined cavities. Finally, this paper proposes that the ratio between acoustic particle displacement and momentum thickness may be used as a criterion to predict the onset of the distinctive resonance at $St\\approx 0.27$. It is suggested that the amplified resonances may be linked to a nonlinear mode shift of the first hydrodynamic mode through enhanced shear-layer oscillation taking place when the proposed criterion is met.

However, the sub-wavelength regime of such devices has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we propose the advanced waveguide superlattices leveraging the artificial gauge field mechanism. This approach achieves remarkable -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broadband bandwidth, experimentally demonstrated over 500 nm, in silicon nitride waveguides. Moreover, the 112 Gbit/s signal encoded per channel of ultra-compact circuits with a bit error rate below the 7% forward error correction limit verified the capability for high-speed on-chip transmission. This design is compatible with metal back end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes and can be readily transferred to other platforms. Thus it holds great promise for significant reduction in on-chip footprint and cost in large-scale integrated photonics, and salient enhancement in the performance of a wide range of active and passive photonic devices and systems.

Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in topological one-dimensional photonic crystal concepts have enabled the development of robust light-emitting devices by incorporating a topological interface state (TIS) at the cavity center. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a one-dimensional TIS-extended photonic crystal (1D-TISE-PC) structure. By integrating a linearly dispersive zero-index one-dimensional photonic crystal structure with a four-phase shift sampled grating, photons propagate along the cavity without phase differences, enhancing the robustness to material variations and extending the TIS. Our findings indicate that extending the TIS promotes a more uniform photon distribution along the laser cavity and mitigates the spatial hole burning (SHB) effect. We fabricated and characterized a 1550 nm sidewall 1D-TISE-PC semiconductor laser, achieving stable single-mode operation across a wide current range from 60 to 420 mA, with a side-mode suppression ratio of 50 dB. The 1D-TISE-PC structure exhibited a linewidth narrowing effect to approximately 150 kHz Lorentzian linewidth. Utilizing reconstruction equivalent-chirp technology for the 4PS sampled grating enabled precise wavelength control in 1D-TISE-PC laser arrays, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.796 nm +- 0.003 nm. We show that the TIS still exists in the TISE cavity and topological protection is preserved. Its mode extension characteristics mitigate the SHB so narrows the linewidth. We argue that the design simplicity and improvement of the fabrication tolerance make this architecture suitable for high-power and narrow-linewidth semiconductor lasers development.         ",

    "abstract": "           We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that linear coupling due to the backscattering between two counterpropagating modes in a Kerr microresonator leads to extreme sensitivity of the intensity asymmetry of nonlinear light states to the relative phase between the bidirectional pumps of equal power. In the absence of linear coupling, the relative pump phase does not affect counterpropagating intraresonator intensities, and two asymmetric states arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Contrariwise, in the presence of weak linear intermode coupling, the asymmetry of the states is deterministically controlled via changes in phase (for all phases except 0 and $\\pi$). Spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero phase is suppressed when the linear intermode coupling is increased, while for the $\\pi$ phase it can be enhanced, so that the overall threshold for the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be significantly lower for nonzero linear coupling. These results are important for fundamental understanding of the processes in Kerr resonators and other systems with Kerr-like nonlinearities and linear intermode coupling and have high prospects for the development of photonic devices such as ultrasensitive sensors.

Metal gratings were also used for GaSb lasers but they introduce additional absorption loss that limits device efficiency and output power. In this paper, we introduce a novel laterally coupled dielectric Bragg grating structure, which enables highly controllable, deterministic, and stable coupling between the grating and the optical mode. Our device demonstrates a continuous-wave output power of 47.02 mW at room temperature, exhibiting stable single-mode operation from 300-1000 mA and achieving a maximum side mode suppression ratio of 46.7 dB.

    "abstract": "           The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.

This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs.

We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale.

The angular displacement, $\\theta$, obeys the dynamics $\\Ddot{\\theta} + \\omega^{2} \\sin{\\theta} = H\\cos{\\omega t}$. The linearized approximation gives a divergent response (at long times) but the nonlinear terms make the response finite. We address the nonlinearity-induced finiteness in two ways by separately treating the short and long time scales. At long times, we use the traditional perturbative techniques to extract two drive dependent behaviours - one, the amplitude of oscillation scales as $(H/\\omega^{2})^{1/3}$ and, two, the time period of the slow mode varies as $(H/\\omega^{2})^{-2/3}$. For the early time behaviour, on the other hand, we devise an alternate perturbative expansion where the successive terms get larger with the order of evaluation but have alternating signs. The alternating signs (phase differences) between these terms leads to adestructive interference like effect. A careful consideration of this destructive interference like effect between successive terms leads to a finite response which describes the initial behaviour of the amplitude of the response reasonably correctly. We further note that for larger drive values, the system seems to undergo a first order transitional behaviour with a sudden jump in the largest Lyapunov exponent.         ",

Our method is able to infer the strength of couplings and fields, but also the time required by the couplings to completely transfer information among the units. We demonstrate the validity of our approach providing excellent results on synthetic datasets of non-Markovian trajectories generated by the Heisenberg-Kuramoto and Vicsek models equipped with delayed interactions.

As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.

    "title": "Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current",
    "abstract": "           In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\\eta_{Kerr}=\\pm \\pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.
