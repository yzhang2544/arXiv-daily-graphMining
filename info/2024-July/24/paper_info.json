    "abstract": "           Quantum mechanics is an integral course for physics students. An understanding of quantum concepts is imperative for enrollment in physics graduate programs, participating in research within physics-fields, and employment at companies developing quantum technologies. This study analyzes 188 US research intensive institutions' course catalogs to determine the role and volume of quantum mechanics in their undergraduate physics programs. All of the institutions required one course on quantum concepts, 92% required two courses, and half required three. For institutions with complete class data (n=56), the quantum curriculum was analyzed using course syllabi. The mean number of classroom hours spent on quantum concepts was found to be 63.5 hours with a standard deviation of 28.1 hours. The most commonly taught themes in the quantum curriculum were the Schr{\u00f6}dinger equation and three-dimensional quantum mechanics. However, the Stern-Gerlach Experiment was only included in 28% of the course outlines. Despite current efforts to promote a spin-first approach, this study found the traditional position-first approaches were still more common as they were used by 73.7% of instructors.         ",

Conversely, optomechanics serves as a crucial domain for theoretical exploration into concepts such as chirality, duality, and parity concerning optical forces. In this paper, we elucidate a method to amalgamate chirality through broken axial parity into optobots, thereby augmenting their versatility. Specifically, we illustrate how this integration allows for out-of-plane rotation which helps in their utilization as optical drills under unidirectional excitation achieved through repetitive stimulation of three focal regions: two traps and one chiral rotational site. We fabricate the microrobots employing two-photon lithography, and note a highly satisfactory correspondence between finite element calculations and experimental observations.         ",

Here, we demonstrate a highly-tunable metasurface device that combines electrical and optical switching in a broadband frequency conversion process. Our device employs electrically tunable hybrid graphene-gold plasmons to convert mid-infrared pulses into visible light by optical gating. A strong electrical modulation of the generated visible light is attained for a broad range of mid-infrared input frequencies, and this modulation is up to 3.5x stronger for the metasurface than for plain graphene.

However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.         ",

    "abstract": "           The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s, while exhibiting a lower bias drift compared to LiNbO3. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Backward stimulated Raman scattering is a three-wave coupling instability requiring the matching of an incoming pump light wave to a scattered light wave and electron plasma wave. It can be harmful to laser-driven inertial confinement fusion because of the reflection of a part of incident laser flux and the generation of suprathermal electrons that preheat the fuel. It is believed that by increasing the laser bandwidth one can suppress the excitation of Raman scattering and mitigate its detrimental effects. It is demonstrated in this paper that using a broad bandwidth laser has little effect on stimulated Raman scattering in the kinetic inflation regime where Landau damping dominates, as the additional bandwidth allows the electron plasma wave to match a wider range of laser frequencies. As a result, plasma wave saturation and Raman backscattering levels remain high even when the laser bandwidth is much larger than the effective instability growth rate.         ",

As an example of a layered structure performing this operation, we propose a three-layer metal-dielectric-metal (MDM) structure. We show that by choosing the parameters of the MDM structure, it is possible to achieve the so-called isotropic vectorial differentiation, for which the intensity of the reflected optical beam (squared electric field magnitude) is proportional to the squared absolute value of the gradient of the incident linearly polarized beam. The presented numerical simulation results demonstrate high-quality vectorial differentiation and confirm the developed theoretical description.         ",

Previous studies focused on the linewidth of alkali metal atoms within the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime near zero magnetic field and in strong magnetic fields where Zeeman resonances are well resolved due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. However, the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime, which is prevalent in various magnetometer and comagnetometer applications, is not well understood. To address this, we developed a theoretical framework based on the master equation for alkali metal atoms and solved it under the rotating wave approximation and weak driving conditions. Our numerical calculations and analytical expressions reveal that the light-narrowing effect occurs only when the ratio of the spin exchange rate to the spin destruction rate exceeds a critical value. Additionally, we show that the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime is significantly influenced by the mutual coupling of quantum coherence between different Zeeman sublevels. These findings provide a theoretical tool for understanding spin relaxation in alkali-metal atoms and optimizing the performance of atomic magnetometers and comagnetometers operating in this regime.

Here, we propose a power-efficient and tunable-bias all-optical nonlinear activation function using vanadium dioxide (VO2) for WDM photonic neural networks. We engineered a SiN/BTO waveguide with a VO2 patch to exploit the phase-change material's reversible insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) for nonlinear activation. We conducted numerical simulations to optimize the waveguide geometry and VO2 parameters, minimizing propagation and coupling losses while achieving a strong nonlinear response and low-threshold activation power. Our proposed device features a sub-milliwatt threshold power, a footprint of 5 $\\mu$m, and an ELU-like activation function. Temporal dynamics show a rise time as low as 5 $\\mu$s. Moreover, the bias of our device could be thermally tuned, improving the speed and power efficiency. On the other hand, performance evaluations using the CIFAR-10 dataset confirmed the device's potential for convolutional neural networks (CNN).

    "abstract": "           We have developed a rectangular loop interferometer (RLI) that confines light in a rectangular path and facilitates various interesting applications. Such a device can yield the sum of numerous geometric series converging to different values between zero and one by the use of simple intra-cavity beam splitters - both polarization-independent and dependent. Losses - principally due to alignment issues of the beam in the RLI - limit the average accuracy of the series sum value to be between 90 - 98\\% with the computation speed determined by the bandwidth of the detectors. In addition, with a circularly polarized input Gaussian beam, and a combination of half-wave plate and q-plate inserted into the interferometer path, the device can generate a vortex beam that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM) of all orders of topological charge. The OAM is generated due to the spin-orbit interaction of light, and the topological charge increases with each successive pass of the beam inside the interferometer. However, experimentally, only the third order of OAM could be measured since projecting out individual orders entailed a slight misalignment of the interferometer, which caused higher orders to go out of resonance. Furthermore, with input linear polarization, the device can generate a vector beam bearing a superposition of polarization states resembling the multipole expansion of a charge distribution. Even here, experimentally, we were able to quantify the polarization distribution up to the third order using a Stokes vector analysis of the vector beam, with the size of the polarization singularity region increasing as the polarization states evolve inside the interferometer. Our work demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of loop interferometers in modifying the scalar and vector properties of light to generate simple mathematical results and other complex but useful applications.

A fundamental question emerges: what role, if any, do quantum coherences between molecular electron states play in photochemical reactions? Answering this question necessitates quantum tomography: the determination of the electronic density matrix from experimental data, where the off-diagonal elements represent these coherences. The Maximal Entropy (MaxEnt) based Quantum State Tomography (QST) approach offers unique advantages in studying molecular dynamics, particularly with partial tomographic data. Here, we explore the application of MaxEnt-based QST on photoexcited ammonia, necessitating the operator form of observables specific to the performed measurements. We present two methodologies for constructing these operators: one leveraging Molecular Angular Distribution Moments (MADMs) which accurately capture the orientation-dependent vibronic dynamics of molecules; and another utilizing Angular Momentum Coherence Operators to construct measurement operators for the full rovibronic density matrix in the symmetric top basis. A key revelation of our study is the direct link between Lagrange multipliers in the MaxEnt formalism and the unique set of MADMs. Furthermore, we achieve a groundbreaking milestone by constructing, for the first time, the entanglement entropy of the electronic subsystem: a metric that was previously inaccessible. The entropy vividly reveals and quantifies the effects of coupling between the excited electron and nuclear degrees of freedom.

    "abstract": "           The recent laser excitation of the low-lying Th-229 isomer transition is starting a revolution in ultralight dark matter searches. The enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the large class of dark matter models dominantly coupling to quarks and gluons will ultimately allow us to probe coupling strengths eight orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds from optical atomic clocks, which are mainly sensitive to dark matter couplings to electrons and photons. We argue that, with increasing precision, observations of the Th-229 excitation spectrum will soon give world-leading constraints. Using data from the pioneering laser excitation of Th-229 by Tiedau et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 182501 (2024)], we present a first dark matter search in the excitation spectrum. While the exclusion limits of our detailed study of the lineshape are still below the sensitivity of currently operating clock experiments, we project the measurement of Zhang et al.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Precise phase control of microwaves and millimeter waves is critical for today's wireless communication and signal processing electronics. For decades, achieving even modest phase-shifting resolution has demanded a complex mix of transistor switches and passive electromagnetic structures. These true-phase delay, true-time-delay or quasi-true-time-delay circuits operate near resonances that heavily attenuate and distort signals, limiting transmission bandwidth. Despite numerous attempts, passive phase shifters have remained lossy and incompatible with high-channel-capacity beamforming, irrespective of the semiconductor fabrication process. In this article, we introduce a mechanism whereby waveguide reflectors based on coupled resonances can be reprogrammed to evade loss. Central to their operation is that loss from internal resonances is confined to low frequencies, while at high frequencies, their reflectivity is maximized and broadband phase variations, induced by those resonances, still persist. Since performance in the low-loss post-resonance spectrum is largely agnostic to the number of switches, ultra-fine digital tuning is possible. This breaks the historical tradeoff between loss and precision to achieve resolution surpassing state-of-the-art integrated circuits by over three orders (bits) of magnitude. The device does not distort the transmitted signal and consumes no power. Moreover, the chip occupies a sub-wavelength footprint in a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor platform. This makes it an optimal candidate for seamless integration in on-chip multi-gigabit data links, radio astronomy transceivers and control hardware for millimeter-wave qubits.         ",

The variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm is a particularly promising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For its experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the advantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can lead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the nitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue of a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques.

    "abstract": "           Stroke poses a significant global health threat, with millions affected annually, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Current stroke risk assessment for the general population relies on markers such as demographics, blood tests, and comorbidities. A minimally invasive, clinically scalable, and cost-effective way to directly measure cerebral blood flow presents an opportunity. This opportunity has potential to positively impact effective stroke risk assessment prevention and intervention. Physiological changes in the cerebral vascular system, particularly in response to carbon dioxide level changes and oxygen deprivation, such as during breath-holding, can offer insights into stroke risk assessment. However, existing methods for measuring cerebral perfusion reserve, such as blood flow and blood volume changes, are limited by either invasiveness or impracticality. Here, we propose a transcranial approach using speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) to non-invasively monitor regional changes in brain blood flow and volume during breath-holding. Our study, conducted on 50 individuals classified into two groups (low-risk and higher-risk for stroke), shows significant differences in blood dynamic changes during breath-holding between the two groups, providing physiological insights for stroke risk assessment using a non-invasive quantification paradigm. Given its cost-effectiveness, scalability, portability, and simplicity, this laser-centric tool has significant potential in enhancing the pre-screening of stroke and mitigating strokes in the general population through early diagnosis and intervention.

Our results show that performance comparable to femtosecond pulses can be obtained with picosecond pulses only by reducing the pulse repetition rate and that such pulses are significantly less prone to the effect of chromatic dispersion.

Regarding the permanents of random Gaussian matrices, the additive error estimation is closely linked to boson sampling, and achieving multiplicative error estimation requires exponentially many samplings. Our newly developed formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size $N$, the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than $\\epsilon(\\sqrt{\\mathrm{e}N})^{N}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In contrast, Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm has an estimation error of $\\epsilon(2\\sqrt{N})^{N}$, which is exponentially larger ($1.2^{N}$) than the quantum method. As expected, the quantum additive error bound fails to reach the multiplicative error bound of $(2\\pi N)^{1/4}\\epsilon(\\sqrt{N/\\mathrm{e}})^{N}$.

Here, the formation of differently shaped gold nanostructures using the direct laser writing method on Au layers of different thicknesses is presented. The resonance peak is demonstrated to be highly dependent on the shape of the structures in the array, thus its position in the spectra, as well as the quality, can be additionally modulated by changing the morphology. The shape of the structure and the resonance itself pertain not only on the laser pulse energy but also on the grating period. This overlapping effect occurring at distances smaller than the diameter of the focused laser beam is studied in detail. By taking advantage of the highly controllable plasmonic resonance, the fabricated gratings open up new opportunities for applications in sensing.         ",

    "title": "MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics",
    "abstract": "           The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.         ",

    "title": "Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited",
    "abstract": "           F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.         ",
