    "abstract": "           From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a platform-crossing toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of such interactions is determined by the product of the single-pass atomic absorption and the number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting nearly 1-million optical roundtrips at the expense of severely limited optical material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. The single-pass absorption probability can be increased through the use of near-concentric, fiber or nanophotonic cavities, which reduce the mode waists at the expense of constrained optical access and exposure to surface fields. Here we present a new high numerical-aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom-single-photon absorption probability per round trip close to its fundamental limit by reducing the mode size at the atom below a micron while keeping the atom mm-to-cm away from all optics. This resonator provides strong light-matter coupling in a cavity where the light circulates only ~ 10 times. We load a single 87Rb atom into such a cavity, observe strong coupling, demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with imaging fidelity of 99.55(6) percent and survival probability of 99.89(4) percent in 130 microseconds, and leverage this new platform for a time-resolved exploration of cavity cooling. The resonator's loss-resilience paves the way to coupling of atoms to nonlinear and adaptive optical elements and provides a minimally invasive route to readout of defect centers. Introduction of intra-cavity imaging systems will enable the creation of cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, vastly expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.

Integrated photonics has enabled chip-scale sources using nonlinear processes, producing high-rate entanglement with sub-100 microwatt power at telecom wavelengths. Many quantum systems operate in the visible or near-infrared ranges, necessitating broadband visible-telecom entangled-pair sources for connecting remote systems via entanglement swapping and teleportation. This study evaluates broadband entanglement generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in various nonlinear integrated photonic materials, including silicon nitride, lithium niobate, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and gallium nitride. We demonstrate how geometric dispersion engineering facilitates phase-matching for each platform and reveals unexpected results, such as robust designs to fabrication variations and a Type-1 cross-polarized phase-matching condition for III-V materials that expands the operational bandwidth. With experimentally attainable parameters, integrated photonic microresonators with optimized designs can achieve pair generation rates greater than ~1 THz/mW$^2$.         ",

For a broad class of lattices, such as honeycomb ones, these points and associated Dirac cones generally appear in non-equivalent pairs. Simultaneous breakup of the time-reversal and inversion symmetry in systems based on such lattices may result in the formation of the unpaired Dirac cones in bulk spectrum, but the existence of topologically protected edge states in such structures remains an open problem. Here photonic Floquet insulator on honeycomb lattice with unpaired Dirac cones in its spectrum is introduced that can support unidirectional edge states appearing at the edge between two regions with opposite sublattice detuning. Topological properties of this system are characterized by the nonzero valley Chern number. Remarkably, edge states in this system can circumvent sharp corners without inter-valley scattering even though there is no total forbidden gap in the spectrum. Our results reveal unusual interplay between two different physical mechanisms of creation of topological edge states based on simultaneous breakup of different symmetries of the system.         ",

It has been demonstrated that such a structure is useful for investigating topological edge solitons, and more specifically, for mimicking the Kline tunneling. However, it is still not clear what the interplay between type-II Dirac cones and the non-Hermiticity mechanism will result in. Here, this question is addressed; in particular, we report the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric photonic lattices with type-II Dirac cones for the first time. We identify a slope-exceptional ring and name it the type-II exceptional ring. We display the restoration of the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the lattice by reducing the separation between the sites in the unit cell. Curiously, the amplitude of the beam during propagation in the non-Hermitian lattice with $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry only decays because of diffraction, whereas in the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken lattice it will be amplified, even though the beam still diffracts.

In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.         ",

However, in nearly all existing lithium niobate electromechanical devices, the configuration is such that the electrodes are in direct contact with the mechanical resonator. This configuration introduces an undesirable mass-loading effect, giving rise to spurious modes and additional damping. Here, we present an electromechanical platform that mitigates this challenge by leveraging a flip-chip bonding technique to separate the electrodes from the mechanical resonator.

    "abstract": "           In the case of single-digit picosecond bunch length, synchrotron light sources produce intense coherent radiation up to the THz range. The reduction of the bunch length by lowering the momentum compaction factor (low-$\\alpha$) gives rise to the micro-bunching instability, which is on one hand a crucial roadblock in the X-ray range during to the resulting effective bunch lengthening but on the other hand also an opportunity for the generation of intense THz radiation if it can be controlled appropriately. In the KIT storage ring KARA (Karlsruhe Research Accelerator), two parallel plates with periodic rectangular corrugations are planned to be installed in an electron storage ring. These plates create an additional longitudinal impedance based on their geometry, which can affect the beam dynamics. The resulting impedance manipulation will be used to study and control the longitudinal electron beam dynamics and the emitted coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). This paper presents the results of systematic studies in simulation of the impact of additional corrugated plate impedances on the longitudinal beam dynamics using the example of the KARA storage ring. If the periodicity of the wake function of the corrugated plates matches the size of the substructures in the longitudinal bunch profile, the instability threshold can be effectively manipulated.

Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable.

Recently TMDs in their quasi-bulk form have started to show considerable promise for nanophotonics thanks to their high refractive indices, large optical anisotropy, wide transparency windows reaching to the visible, and robust room temperature excitons promising for nonlinear optics. Adherence of TMD layers to any substrate via van der Waals forces is a further key enabler for nanofabrication of sophisticated photonic structures requiring heterointegration. Here, we capitalize on these attractive properties and realize topological spin-Hall photonic lattices made of arrays of triangular nanoholes in 50 to 100 nm thick WS$_2$ flakes exfoliated on SiO$_2$/Si substrates. High quality structures are achieved taking advantage of anisotropic dry etching dictated by the crystal axes of WS$_2$.

We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\u00e4nchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\\eta_{Kerr}=\\pm \\pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.

    "abstract": "           Control of microscopic physical systems is a prerequisite for experimental quantum science and its applications. Neutral atomic and molecular systems can be controlled using tunable scattering resonances. However, the resonant control of effective interactions has so far been limited to the ultracold regime, where quantum effects become manifest. Ultracold temperatures are still out of reach for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems, a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we show that magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances can be used to control inelastic collisions between a single trapped Sr${}^+$ ion and Rb atoms high above the ultracold regime. We measure inelastic collision probabilities and use the results to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. The observed collision dynamics show signatures of quantum interference, resulting in the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates in the multiple-partial-wave regime. With our model, we discover multiple measurable Feshbach resonances for magnetic fields from 0 to 400 G, which allow significant enhancement of spin-exchange rates at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of the predicted resonances should allow precise calibration and control of the short-range dynamics in the ${\\text{Sr}^++\\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.

    "abstract": "           We studied the frequency and quality factor of mechanical plasmonic nanoresonators as a function of temperature, ranging from ambient to 4 K. Our investigation focused on individual gold nanorods and nanodisks of various sizes. We observed that oscillation frequencies increase linearly as temperature decreases until saturation is reached at cryogenic temperatures. This behavior is explained by the temperature dependence of the elastic modulus, with a Debye temperature compatible with reported bulk values for gold. To describe the behavior of the quality factor, we developed a model considering the nanostructures as anelastic solids, identifying a dissipation peak around 150 K due to a thermally activated process, likely of the Niblett-Wilks mechanism type. Importantly, our findings suggest that external dissipation factors are more critical to improving quality factors than internal friction, which can be increased by modifying the nanoresonator's environment. Our results enable the design of structures with high vibration frequencies and quality factors by effectively controlling external losses.         ",

The solver is based on a hybrid optoelectronic scheme including a photonic chip and the corresponding electronic driving circuit. The photonic chip is fabricated on silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate and integrates high-speed electro-optic modulators, thermo-optic phase shifters and photodetectors to conduct the 16-dimensional optical vector-matrix multiplication (OVMM). Due to the parallel and low latency propagation of lightwave, the calculation of the QUBO cost function can be accelerated. Besides, the electronic processor is employed to run the heuristic algorithm to search the optimal solution. In the experiment, two 16-dimensional randomly generated QUBO problems are solved with high successful probabilities. To our knowledge, it is the largest scale of programmable and on-chip photonic solver ever reported. Moreover, the computing speed of the OVMM on photonic chip is ~2 TFLOP/s. It shows the potential of fast solving such optimization problems with integrated photonic systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Artificial intelligence (AI) systems of autonomous systems such as drones, robots and self-driving cars may consume up to 50% of total power available onboard, thereby limiting the vehicle's range of functions and considerably reducing the distance the vehicle can travel on a single charge. Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect and process even larger amounts of data in real time. This problem cannot be solved using the traditional computing devices since they become more and more power-consuming. In this review article, we discuss the perspectives of development of onboard neuromorphic computers that mimic the operation of a biological brain using nonlinear-dynamical properties of natural physical environments surrounding autonomous vehicles. Previous research also demonstrated that quantum neuromorphic processors (QNPs) can conduct computations with the efficiency of a standard computer while consuming less than 1% of the onboard battery power. Since QNPs is a semi-classical technology, their technical simplicity and low, compared with quantum computers, cost make them ideally suitable for application in autonomous AI system. Providing a perspective view on the future progress in unconventional physical reservoir computing and surveying the outcomes of more than 200 interdisciplinary research works, this article will be of interest to a broad readership, including both students and experts in the fields of physics, engineering, quantum technologies and computing.

The implant is optically powered and controlled using safe illumination at near-infrared wavelengths. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hosting a digital control unit is used to control the implant's electrodes. The ASIC is powered using an advanced photovoltaic (PV) cell and programmed using a single photodiode. Diamond packaging technology is utilized to achieve high-density integration of the implant optoelectronic circuitry, as well as individual connections between a stimulator chip and 256 electrodes, within a 4.6 mm x 3.7 mm x 0.9 mm implant package. An ultrahigh efficiency PV cell with a monochromatic power conversion efficiency of 55% is used to power the implant. On-board photodetection circuity with a bandwidth of 3.7 MHz is used for forward data telemetry of stimulation parameters. In comparison to implants which utilize inductively coupled coils, laser power delivery enables a high degree of miniaturization and lower surgical complexity. The device presented combines the benefits of implant miniaturization and a flexible stimulation strategy provided by a dedicated stimulator chip.

These interferometers do not rely on the ubiquitous light-pulses of traditional atom sensors, but are instead built from an innovative design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice formed by interfering laser beams. Through time-dependent control of the position of the lattice in three-dimensional space, we realize simultaneous Bloch oscillations in two dimensions, and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of $2g$ along two axes, where $g$ is the average gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for selected examples of two-axis accelerations. We demonstrate the resulting accuracy and sensitivity for vector parameter estimation. Our acceleration can be measured from a single experimental run and does not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. We find the performance of our device to be near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms. We discuss the reconfigurability of the vector accelerometer and the pathway toward further sensitivity.         ",

However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles typically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic field confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of molecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It remains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual physical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic semiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles in realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a vacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient metric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode situations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with photonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These vacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of light-matter coherence that the system can sustain.         ",

The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time.

To achieve error-resistant quantum memory, one would like to store the information in a quantum superposition of degenerate states engineered in such a way that local sources of noise cannot change one state into another, thus preventing quantum decoherence. One promising concept is that of fracton order -- a phase of matter with a large ground state degeneracy that grows subextensively with the system size. Unfortunately, the models realizing fractons are not friendly to experimental implementations as they require unnatural interactions between a substantial number (of the order of ten) of qubits. We demonstrate how this limitation can be circumvented by leveraging the long-range quantum entanglement created using only pairwise interactions between the code and ancilla qubits, realizable in programmable tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms. We show that this platform also allows to detect and correct certain types of errors en route to the goal of true error-resistant quantum memory.         ",

Employing a simple fabrication process, we demonstrate plasmonic cavities that support a nanoscale mode volume and exhibit an increase in the spontaneous emission rate with a measured Purcell factor of up to 48. In addition to investigating the optical resonance modes, we demonstrate that an improvement in the optical stability of the spin-preserving resonant optical transitions relative to the radiation-limited value. The results highlight the potential of nanophotonic structures for advancing quantum networking technologies and emphasizes the importance of optimizing emitter-cavity interactions for efficient quantum photonic applications.

We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.

Classically, the beam is excited with an RF field comprising a frequency band around one of the betatron sidebands. This article demonstrates that the third-integer resonance commonly used for the slow extraction induces nonlinear motion, resulting in the appearance of additional sidebands of higher order at multiples of the betatron tune. Measured and simulated beam spectra are presented, revealing these sidebands and the beam's response to being excited at first and second order sidebands. The feasibility of using a second order sideband for the purpose of slow extraction is demonstrated. This results in a significant improvement in the temporal structure (spill quality) of the extracted beam, but at the cost of higher excitation power requirements. This is observed both experimentally and in tracking simulations. The mechanism behind the observed improvement is explained using beam dynamics simulations.         ",

We considered only nearest neighbor interaction between the waveguides. We found that in the case of low Kerr nonlinearity, evolution of optical power shows synchronization behavior. But when we increased the strength of Kerr nonlinearity, we discovered that spatial evolution of optical power in all waveguides shows independent characteristics. On the other hand, we have studied the impact of the coupling constant on the synchronization dynamics of our system. Our findings showed us that strong coupling can strengthen the collective dynamics in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. From our results, we can conclude that Kerr nonlinearity in our system plays the role of disorder parameter that destroys as well as alters the synchronization behavior of evolution of optical power in the waveguides and coupling constant plays the role of an antagonist and restores synchronization in the model.

    "abstract": "           Terahertz (THz) imaging is one of the hotspots in the field of optics, where the depth information retrieval is a key factor to restore the three-dimensional appearance of objects. Impressive results for depth extraction in visible and infrared wave range have been demonstrated through deep learning (DL). Among them, most DL methods are merely data-driven, lacking relevant physical priors, which thus request for a large amount of experimental data to train the DL models.However, large training data acquirement in the THz domain is challenging due to the requirements of environmental and system stability, as well as the time-consuming data acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, this paper incorporates a complete physical model representing the THz image formation process into traditional DL networks to retrieve the depth information of objects. The most significant advantage is the ability to use it without pre-training, thereby eliminating the need for tens of thousands of labeled data. Through experiments validation, we demonstrate that by providing diffraction patterns of planar objects with their upper and lower halves individually masked, the proposed physics-informed neural network (NN) can automatically optimize and, ultimately, reconstruct the depth of the object through interaction between the NN and a physical model. The obtained results represent the initial steps towards achieving fast holographic THz imaging using reference-free beams and low-cost power detection.         ",

    "abstract": "           Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (<-24dB) or pass (>-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.         ",

Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz. Long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 58 hours of mode-hop-free operation, with a trend in the frequency drift of only 4.4 MHz/h. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.         ",

As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.
