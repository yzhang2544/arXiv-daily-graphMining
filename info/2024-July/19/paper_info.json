A comprehensive characterization of the thermal profile in the hot zone of the filament splicer was conducted using a fiber Bragg grating, providing valuable insights into its stability and overall performance. Results demonstrate mechanically strong joints and suggest a very narrow temperature window to achieve strong connection between the two materials. Moreover, we characterize the surface composition of the ZrF4 fiber using energy dispersive spectroscopy following splicing at ideal temperatures, as well as at higher and lower temperatures. This work paves the way towards future implementation of silica and fluoride fibers splicing using alternative splicing solutions such as CO2 laser system while raising interesting facts for further studies in the specific field.

    "abstract": "           A quadrature lattice is a coupled array of squeezed vacuum field quadratures that offers new avenues in shaping the quantum properties of multimode light [1-3]. Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \\chi(2) and \\chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.

The output ultraviolet pulse has a tunable wavelength ranging from 250 nm to 430 nm and an energy level up to sub-mJ. An octave-spanning ultraviolet supercontinuum with a flatness better than 3 dB can also be obtained via longitudinally modulated dispersion.

    "abstract": "           We report on the theoretical analysis as well as the numerical simulations about the nonlinear dynamics of cavity solitons in a passive Kerr resonator operating in the multistable regime under the condition of a sufficiently strong pump. In this regime, the adjacent tilted cavity resonances might overlap, thus leading to the co-existence of combinatory states of temporal cavity solitons and the extended modulation instability patterns. Very interestingly, the cavity in the regime of multistablity may sustain distinct families of cavity solitons, vividly termed as super cavity solitons with much higher intensity and broader spectra if compared with those in the conventional bi-stable regime. The description of such complex cavity dynamics in the multstable regime requires either the infinite-dimensional Ikeda map, or the derived mean-field coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations by involving the contributing cavity resonances. With the latter model, for the first time, we revealed the existence of different orders of super cavity solitons, whose stationary solutions were obtained by using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Along this line, with the continuation calculation, we have plotted the Hopf / saddle-node bifurcation curves, thus identifying the existing map of the stable and breathing (super) cavity solitons. With this defined parameter space, we have proposed an efficient method to excite and switch the super cavity solitons by adding an appropriate intensity (or phase) perturbation on the pump. Such deterministic cavity soliton manipulation technique is demonstrated to underpin the multi-level coding, which may enable the large capacity all-optical buffering based on the passive fiber ring cavities.

We find that double precision affords an unnecessarily high level of precision, leading to optimization opportunities. We show how an approximation built from an error-free matrix multiplication transformation can be used to potentially accelerate this kernel on future hardware.

Herein, we present comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of the photon-mediated hybridization of magnons and phonons in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate the intriguing concept of composite states formed by distinct electric and magnetic quasiparticles strongly coupled to the same optical cavity modes. Specifically, we explore magnons excited in a slab of an antiferromagnetic crystal and phonons excited in a distinct specimen of an insulating material. The crystal slabs form an optical cavity with Fabry-P\u00e9rot oscillations in the THz range. We demonstrate hybridized phonon-magnon polariton modes and their tunability by adjusting the distance between the slabs, showing that hybridization persists even at separations up to several millimeters. The experimental results are interpreted using both classical and quantum electrodynamical models. The quantum description allows us to quantify the degree of hybridization that is linked to a topological behavior of the electric field phasor, in agreement with the classical electrodynamics expectations. Importantly, the presented results refer to temperature conditions and cavities of millimeter size, paving the way for engineering realistic, frequency-tunable THz devices through the hybridization of electric (phononics) and magnetic (spintronics) elementary excitations of matter.

    "abstract": "           Monitoring the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) is of paramount importance for experiments involving few cycle intense laser fields. Common measurement techniques include f-2f interferometry or stereo-ATI setups. These approaches are adequate, but are challenging to implement on demand, at different locations as additional metrology tools, in intense few cycle laser-matter interaction experiments, such as those prevalent in sophisticated user beamlines. In addition there are inherent difficulties for CEP measured at non-conventional laser wavelengths (like e.g. mid infrared) and measurements above 10 kHz laser repetition rates, on single shot basis. Here we demonstrate both by simulations and by experiments a machine learning (ML) driven method for CEP estimation in the mid infrared, which is readily generalizable for any laser wavelength and possibly up to MHz repetition rates. The concept relies on the observation of the spectrum of high harmonic generation (HHG) in bulk material and the use of ML techniques to estimate the CEP of the laser. Once the ML model is trained, the method provides a way for cheap and compact real-time CEP tagging. This technique can complement the otherwise sophisticated monitoring of CEP, and is able to capture the complex correlation between the CEP and the observable HHG spectra.         ",

However, the design of a new electromagnetic energy harvester with a deep-subwavelength thickness (~ 0.004{\\lambda}) is the major concern of this work. The proposed structure shows an enhanced level of absorption. Decreasing the thickness of metasurface as a new classification of energy harvester, we have managed to demonstrate the stability of the efficiency.

    "abstract": "           Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20\u00b0. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25\u00b0. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, while the HPBW remains below 20\u00b0 across the operational frequency range.

Numerical simulations show that the relative phase of the two input fields plays an important role in controlling the appearance of chaotic motion and, more importantly, the threshold power of chaos is reduced by 6 orders of magnitude from watts to microwatts.

QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we aim at developing QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, i.e. that use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated by means of simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods first yield the following results. Just running them with standard PC and software already makes it possible to evaluate their performance for up to 13 qubits, i.e. with state space dimensions up to a few thousands. This shows their attractiveness in terms of accuracy and proves that they solve the core of the dense QPT problem in a very limited time frame. For other test results, see the paper.         ",

This combination allows not only to compensate for the non-instantaneous response of the laser to an input modulation, but also to correct in real time the stochastic frequency fluctuations. We implement this multi-stage architecture on a commercial DBR laser and verify its efficiency, first with monochromatic operation and second with highly demanding frequency excursions. We demonstrate that our multi-stage correction not only enables a strong reduction of the laser linewidth, but also allows steep frequency excursions with a relative RMS frequency error well below $1$%, and a laser spectral purity consistently better than $100$~kHz even in the midst of GHz-scale frequency excursions.

We revealed a non-adiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay becomes a heating source of muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch that directly results in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states dd$\\mu^\\ast$ and dt$\\mu^\\ast$ are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the $\\mu$CF cycle which skips a slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the $\\mu$CF cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of $1.5$--$1.997$ keV, which is close to the K$\\alpha$ x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic deuterium atoms, state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.

    "title": "Is the dynamical quantum Cheshire cat detectable?",
    "abstract": "           We explore how one might detect the dynamical quantum Cheshire cat proposed by Aharonov et al. We show that, in practice, we need to bias the initial state by adding/subtracting a small probability amplitude (`field') of the orthogonal state, which travels with the disembodied property, to make the effect detectable (i.e. if our initial state is $|\\uparrow_z\\rangle$, we need to bias this with some small amount $\\delta$ of state $|\\downarrow_z\\rangle$). This biasing, which can be done either directly or via weakly entangling the state with a pointer, effectively provides a phase reference with which we can measure the evolution of the state. The outcome can then be measured as a small probability difference in detections in a mutually unbiased basis, proportional to this biasing $\\delta$. We show this is different from counterfactual communication, which provably does not require any probe field to travel between sender Bob and receiver Alice for communication. We further suggest an optical polarisation experiment where these phenomena might be demonstrated in a laboratory.         ",

    "title": "Real-time Dynamics of the Schwinger Model as an Open Quantum System with Neural Density Operators",
    "abstract": "           Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.         ",
