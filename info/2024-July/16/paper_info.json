    "title": "Real and imaginary part symmetries (RIPS) and artifacts removal in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy without water suppression",
    "abstract": "           Purpose: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) without water suppression (WS) possess some distinct advantages over the conventionally used 1H MRSI with WS. However, the sideband artifacts in the non-water suppressed spectra hinder the applications of the 1H MRSI without WS. Although many hardware or software techniques to tackle the sidebands have been developed, they suffer from various shortcomings, such as the prolonged data acquisition time, insufficient elimination of the sidebands, or loss of some spectral information. Here, we present a software method that allows the elimination of sideband artifacts from 1H MRSI data acquired without WS. Methods The presented method is based on the following observations: (1) the real part of the sidebands is anti-symmetric, and the imaginary part of sidebands is symmetric about the unsuppressed water signal, which is at the center of the spectrum, and (2) there is no observable metabolite resonances in the downfield region spectrum acquired with conventional MRSI pulse sequences. We model the complex sidebands in the downfield region using a singular value decomposition-based method, reconstruct from them the upfield sidebands according to the symmetry features of the sidebands, and subtract the sidebands from the spectrum. We demonstrate the method using phantom and in vivo data. Results The method can remarkably reduce sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. In both phantom data and high-quality in vivo data, the residual sidebands are smaller than those in the WS spectra. Conclusion The method allows to remove sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. The performance of the method on phantom data and high-quality in vivo data outperforms on poor quality in vivo data.         ",

    "abstract": "           Thick metamorphic buffers are perceived to be indispensable for the heteroepitaxial integration of III-V semiconductors on silicon substrates with large thermal expansion and lattice mismatches. However, III-nitride buffers in conventional GaN-on-Si high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) heterostructures impose a substantial thermal resistance, throttling heat extraction, which reduces device efficiency and lifetime. Herein, bypassing the buffer, we demonstrate the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on silicon by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). By varying reactor pressure, we modulate the growth stress in the submicron epilayers and realise threading dislocation densities similar to that in thick buffered structures. We achieve a GaN-to-substrate thermal resistance of (11(+/-)4) ((m^2)K(GW^-1)), an order of magnitude reduction over conventional designs on silicon and one of the lowest on any non-native substrate. AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this platform show a characteristic 2D electron gas (2DEG), the room-temperature Hall-effect mobility of which, at over 2000 (cm^2/(V-s)), rivals the best-reported values. The low-temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime > 0.180 ps, and tell-tale signatures of spin-splitting. These results may establish a new paradigm for nitride HEMTs, potentially accelerating applications from energy-efficient transistors to fundamental investigations on electron dynamics in this 2D wide-bandgap system.

    "abstract": "           We have measured the spontaneous and photo-induced decays of anionic gold clusters, Au$_N^-$, with sizes ranging from $N = 2$ to 13, and 15. After production in a sputter ion source, the size-selected clusters were stored in the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE and their neutralization decays were measured for storage times between 0.1 and 100 s. The dimer was observed to decay by electron emission in parallel to neutral atom emission at long times, analogously to the behavior of copper and silver dimers, implying a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Radiative cooling is observed for all cluster sizes except for the dimer. The decay rates of clusters $N=3,6,8-13,15$ show only a single radiative cooling time. For $N=6-13$ the cooling times have a strong odd-even oscillation with an amplitude that decrease with cluster size, and with the even $N$ having the fast cooling. We compare our results with previous measurements of radiative cooling rates of the corresponding cationic gold clusters, Au$_N^+$, which also show an odd-even effect with a similar oscillation amplitude but at orders of magnitude shorter time scales, and out of phase with the anions.

By analyzing an oscillator model describing the electron motions in the fiber medium, we can obtain the third-order susceptibility in the presence of the magnetic field. According to the Maxwell's equations and the minimal coupling principle in the metric expression of the curved space, we derive the propagation equations of light in a helically wound optical fiber.

    "abstract": "           We present the results of an extensive evaluation of strip and pixel AC-LGAD sensors tested with a 120 GeV proton beam, focusing on the influence of design parameters on the sensor temporal and spatial resolutions. Results show that reducing the thickness of pixel sensors significantly enhances their time resolution, with 20 $\\mu$m-thick sensors achieving around 20 ps. Uniform performance is attainable with optimized sheet resistance, making these sensors ideal for future timing detectors. Conversely, 20 $\\mu$m-thick strip sensors exhibit higher jitter than similar pixel sensors, negatively impacting time resolution, despite reduced Landau fluctuations with respect to the 50 $\\mu$m-thick versions. Additionally, it is observed that a low resistivity in strip sensors limits signal size and time resolution, whereas higher resistivity improves performance. This study highlights the importance of tuning the n$^{+}$ sheet resistance and suggests that further improvements should target specific applications like the Electron-Ion Collider or other future collider experiments. In addition, the detailed performance of four AC-LGADs sensor designs is reported as examples of possible candidates for specific detector applications. These advancements position AC-LGADs as promising candidates for future 4D tracking systems, pending the development of specialized readout electronics.         ",

These observations reveal characteristic sequences of narrow-band, high-frequency bursts exceeding 100 Hz embedded into a slower evolution around 1 Hz, persisting for several hours. To explore the potential role of the ion-acoustic instability (IAI) in these phenomena, we begin by reviewing classical findings on the IAI within the framework of linear kinetic theory. Focusing on proton distributions comprising both a core and a beam component, we analyze the IAI instability range and growth rates within the parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. Our findings indicate that the IAI can indeed occur in this regime, albeit requiring electron-to-core and beam-to-core temperature ratios slightly different from reported values during electrostatic burst detection. Furthermore, employing 1D kinetic plasma simulations, we validate the growth rates predicted by linear theory and observe the saturation behavior of the instability. The resultant nonlinear structures exhibit trapped proton beam populations and oscillatory signatures comparable to those observed, both in terms of time scales and amplitude.         ",

Here, we demonstrate a non-reciprocal magneto-optic response by integrating multilayer 2D CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) onto silicon micro ring resonators (MRRs).Under an applied magnetic field, the CCPS intralayer ferromagnetic ordering, characterized by easy-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy, induces asymmetrical modal responses in the clockwise (CW)and counterclockwise (CCW) light propagation directions. The proposed configuration achieves a low insertion loss of 0.15 dB and a high isolation ratio of 28 dB at 1550 nm. Notably, it exhibits a significant resonance wavelength splitting of 0.4 nm between the counter propagation directions, supporting a 50 GHz optical bandwidth. Operating directly in the transverse electric (TE) mode, it aligns with the main polarization used in silicon photonics circuit, eliminating the need for additional polarization management. The device is ultra-compact, with 2D flake interaction length ranging from 22 um to 55 um and a thickness between 39 nm and 62 nm. Its operation range covers the entire C-band with a bandwidth of up to 100 nm.

In this theoretical article, we go beyond the simple model used in the previous study to address more phenomena, such as the appearance of bunching shoulders in the second-order correlation function, Rabi splitting in the steady-state spectrum, and population dynamics on excited Dicke states, which for moderate pumping explains the observed collective effects. Overall, our results can guide further experiments with NV centers, and they are also relevant for other solid-state color centers, such as silicon-vacancy centers in diamond and silicon carbide, boron-vacancy centers and carbon-related centers in hexagonal boron-nitride.

Beyond the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, perfect photon blockade with vanishing $g^{(2)}(0)$ is achievable in two-photon interference.

    "abstract": "           The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm H_4$, and $\\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.         ",

Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters.

    "abstract": "           Photon-mediated interaction can be used for simulating complex many-body phenomena with ultracold atoms coupled to electromagnetic modes of an optical resonator. We theoretically study a method of producing controllable interatomic interaction mediated by forward-diffracted photons circulating inside a ring cavity. One example of such a system is the three-mode cavity, where an on-axis mode can coexist with two diffracted sidebands. We demonstrate how the self-organized stripe states of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) occurring in this cavity geometry can exhibit supersolid properties, due to spontaneous breaking of the Hamiltonian's continuous translational symmetry. A numerical study of the collective excitation spectrum of these states demonstrates the existence of massles and finite-gap excitations, which are identified as phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) atomic density modes. We further demonstrate how judicious Fourier filtering of intracavity light can be used to engineer the effective atom-atom interaction profile for many cavity modes. The numerical results in this configuration show the existence of droplet array and single droplet BEC states for commensurate and incommensurate cavity modes, respectively. Diffractive coupling in a cavity is thereby introduced as a novel route towards tailoring the photon-mediated interaction of ultracold atoms. Spatial features of the self-organized optical potentials can here be tuned to scales several times larger than the pump laser wavelength, such that the corresponding atomic density distributions could be imaged and manipulated using low numerical aperture optics. These calculations and insights pave the way towards quantum simulation of exotic nonequilibrium many-body physics with condensates in a cavity.         ",

Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit.         ",

Besides TOF mass measurements, the detector system will also be used for heavy ion beam trajectory monitoring or momentum measurements for both beam-line and in-ring at the Rare-RI Ring. The position and timing measurements of heavy ions are performed by detecting the secondary electrons (SEs) emitted from a conversion foil during the passage of the ion.

In order to connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we have synthesised this educational research into a decision-tree based theoretical model for the transformation of QIST curricula, intended to provide a didactical perspective for practitioners. The Quantum Curriculum Transformation Framework (QCTF) consists of four steps: 1. choose a topic, 2. choose one or more targeted skills, 3. choose a learning goal and 4. choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way, educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and with future testing and refinement it will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST.         ",

Here, we introduce an effective method which can greatly enhance its high-frequency performance. The idea is to recycle the residual PDH signal of a laser locked to a cavity, by feedforwarding it directly to the laser output field after a delay fiber. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrate a phase noise suppression capability about 4 orders of magnitude better than just using usual PDH feedback for phase noise around a few MHz. We further find that this method exhibits noise suppression performance equivalent to cavity filtering. The new method holds great promise for applications demanding highly stable lasers with diminished phase noise up to tens of MHz, e.g. precise and high-speed control of atomic and molecular quantum states.

    "abstract": "           To derive the best oscillator phase noise when implementing a high-Q resonator, the spectral line-shape must have high contrast and symmetry. Ideally, this line-shape is Lorentzian, however, in a high mode density spectral region, low-Q background spurious modes interact and distort the resonance. For a sapphire-loaded cavity resonator operating with whispering gallery modes we show that this high contrast and symmetry can be achieved by changing the dimensions of the surrounding cavity shield to tune the background low-Q structures into anti-resonance. This works because the high-Q resonances are primarily defined by the sapphire while the background modes are defined by the cavity shield. Alternatively, it was shown that a similar result can be achieved by exciting the high-Q resonator with a balanced microwave dipole probe in a Mach Zehnder interferometric configuration. The probe was constructed from two separate coaxial electric field probes symmetrically inserted into a cylindrical cavity resonator, from opposite sides with a small gap between them, so they can behave like an active wire dipole antenna. The power into the two separate probes may be matched with an external variable attenuator in one of the arms of the interferometer. Conversely, the phase between the two electric field probes may be changed with an external variable phase shifter, which changes the nature of the field components the probe couples to. The probe couples to the high-Q resonant modes as well as low-Q background modes, which can be made resonant or anti-resonant for the high-Q modes by changing this external phase. When the background modes are in anti-resonance the line shape of the high-Q mode can be made symmetric and with higher contrast. This technique was applied to both whispering gallery sapphire modes, as well as hollow cavity resonators, without changing the dimensions of the cavity.         ",

    "abstract": "           Performing noise characterizations of lasers and optical frequency combs on sampled data offers numerous advantages compared to analog measurement techniques. One of the main advantages is that the measurement setup is greatly simplified. Only a balanced detector followed by an analog-to-digital converter is needed, allowing all the complexity to be moved to the digital domain. Secondly, near-optimal phase estimators are efficiently implementable, providing accurate phase noise estimation in the presence of the measurement noise. Finally, joint processing of multiple comb lines is feasible, enabling computation of phase noise correlation matrix, which includes all information about the phase noise of the optical frequency comb. This tutorial introduces a framework based on digital signal processing for phase noise characterization of lasers and optical frequency combs. The framework is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and automatic differentiation. The EKF is a near-optimal estimator of the optical phase in the presence of measurement noise, making it very suitable for phase noise measurements. Automatic differentiation is key to efficiently optimizing many parameters entering the EKF framework. More specifically, the combination of EKF and automatic differentiation enables the efficient optimization of phase noise measurement for optical frequency combs with arbitrarily complex noise dynamics that may include many free parameters. We show the framework's efficacy through simulations and experimental data, showcasing its application across various comb types and in dual-comb measurements, highlighting its accuracy and versatility. Finally, we discuss its capability for digital phase noise compensation, which is highly relevant to free-running dual-comb spectroscopy applications.         ",

The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.

    "abstract": "           In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.         ",

    "abstract": "           Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.

    "abstract": "           Finding the distribution of the velocities and pressures of a fluid by solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a principal task in the chemical, energy, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in mechanical engineering and the design of pipeline systems. With existing solvers, such as OpenFOAM and Ansys, simulations of fluid dynamics in intricate geometries are computationally expensive and require re-simulation whenever the geometric parameters or the initial and boundary conditions are altered. Physics-informed neural networks are a promising tool for simulating fluid flows in complex geometries, as they can adapt to changes in the geometry and mesh definitions, allowing for generalization across fluid parameters and transfer learning across different shapes. We present a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network that simulates laminar fluid flows in 3D Y-shaped mixers. Our approach combines the expressive power of a quantum model with the flexibility of a physics-informed neural network, resulting in a 21% higher accuracy compared to a purely classical neural network. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning approaches, and in particular hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network, for complex shape optimization tasks in computational fluid dynamics. By improving the accuracy of fluid simulations in complex geometries, our research using hybrid quantum models contributes to the development of more efficient and reliable fluid dynamics solvers.

Here we provide a microscopic understanding of this unexpected stability and dynamics in atom-molecule superfluids; we show one essential element behind these phenomena is an extremely narrow Feshbach resonance in $^{133}$Cs at 19.849G. Comparing theory and experiment we demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\\textit{i.e.}, Bose enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the formation of Cooper-like pairs of bosonic atoms that have opposite momenta. Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.

    "abstract": "           Emergent collective modes in lattices give birth to many intriguing physical phenomena in condensed matter physics. Among these collective modes, large-area modes typically feature small-level spacings, while a mode with stable frequency tends to be spatially tightly confined. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a spectral-isolated photonic topological corner mode with a tunable mode area and stable frequency in a two-dimensional photonic crystal. This mode emerges from hybridizing the large-area homogeneous mode and in-gap topological corner modes. Remarkably, this large-area homogeneous mode possesses unique chirality and has a tunable mode area under the change of the mass term of the inner topological non-trivial lattice. We experimentally observe such topological large-area corner modes(TLCM) in a 2D photonic system and demonstrate the robustness by introducing disorders in the structure. Our findings have propelled the forefront of higher-order topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to multi-lattice systems. They may support promising potential applications, particularly in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.         ",

In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path.

This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures.

In light of recent advances in photonic quantum technology, it is natural to utilize quantum exponential speedup to scale photonic neural network capabilities. Here we show a combination of classical network layers with trainable continuous variable quantum circuits yields hybrid networks with improved trainability and accuracy. On a classification task, hybrid networks achieve the same performance when benchmarked against fully classical networks that are twice the size. When the bit precision of the optimized networks is reduced through added noise, the hybrid networks still achieve greater accuracy when evaluated at state of the art bit precision.
