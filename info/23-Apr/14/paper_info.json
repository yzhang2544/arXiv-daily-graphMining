    "abstract": "Large-scale low-background detectors are increasingly used in rare-event searches as experimental collaborations push for enhanced sensitivity. However, building such detectors, in practice, creates an abundance of radioassay data especially during the conceptual phase of an experiment when hundreds of materials are screened for radiopurity. A tool is needed to manage and make use of the radioassay screening data to quantitatively assess detector design options. We have developed a Materials Database Application for the nEXO experiment to serve this purpose. This paper describes this database, explains how it functions, and discusses how it streamlines the design of the experiment. ",

To counter these fluctuations, we demonstrate a dynamic feedback system implemented by the locking of a microwave drive to the noisy cavity. A homodyne interferometer scheme monitors the cavity resonance fluctuations due to low-frequency noise, which is mitigated by frequency-modulating (FM) the microwave generator. The feedback has a bandwidth of $400$ Hz, with a reduction of cavity fluctuations by $84\\%$ integrating up to a bandwidth of $2$ kHz. Moreover, the cavity resonance frequency fluctuations are reduced by $73\\%$. This scheme can be scaled to enable multi-tone experiments locked to the same feedback signal. As a demonstration, we apply the feedback to an optomechanical experiment and implement a cavity-locked, multi-tone mechanical measurement. As low-frequency cavity frequency noise can be a limiting factor in many experiments, the multi-tone microwave locking technique presented here is expected to be relevant for a wide range of fields of research.

Assuming a quantum superposition of dimers in microtubules we have separately presented two types of interaction with its environment. For interaction with bosonic environment we have shown that the decoherence time scale depends on a constant factor which depends on the interaction coefficients and amplitude of spectral density.

They are characterized by a non-zero Berry phase, which is a topological invariant defined on a closed path in atomic coordinate space, taking the value $\\pi$ when the path encircles the intersection manifold. In this work, we show that for real molecular Hamiltonians, the Berry phase can be obtained by tracing a local optimum of a variational ansatz along the chosen path and estimating the overlap between the initial and final state with a control-free Hadamard test. Moreover, by discretizing the path into $N$ points, we can use $N$ single Newton-Raphson steps to update our state non-variationally. Finally, since the Berry phase can only take two discrete values (0 or $\\pi$), our procedure succeeds even for a cumulative error bounded by a constant; this allows us to bound the total sampling cost and to readily verify the success of the procedure. We demonstrate numerically the application of our algorithm on small toy models of the formaldimine molecule (\\ce{H2C=NH}). ",

Here, we make progress in this direction and introduce a numerical method for open quantum systems, based on tree tensor networks. Such a structure is expected to improve the encoding of many-body correlations and we adopt an integration scheme suited for long-range interactions and applications to dissipative dynamics. We test the method using a dissipative Ising model with power-law decaying interactions and observe signatures of a first-order phase transition for power-law exponents smaller than one. ",

The computational bottleneck of the classical algorithm -- symmetric matrix inversion -- is addressed here using the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), a recently developed noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. We apply our algorithm to single and multichannel quantum scattering problems, obtaining accurate vibrational relaxation probabilities in collinear atom-molecule collisions. We also show how the algorithm could be scaled up to simulate collisions of large polyatomic molecules. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to calculate scattering cross sections and rates for complex molecular collisions on NISQ quantum processors, opening up the possibility of scalable digital quantum computation of gas-phase bimolecular collisions and reactions of relevance to astrochemistry and ultracold chemistry.

Pursuing the characterization of such solitons, here we found soliton solutions of a distributed model for mode-locked lasers in the presence of group velocity and fourth order dispersions (GVD and 4OD respectively), for two saturable absorber saturation powers. We found that the energy of the pulses follows an inverse relation with the width, with most cases following a different trend than the one found for conservative quartic solitons.

For quantum systems of increasing Hilbert space size, this imposes a significant bottleneck. We revisit the strategy of hard-coding gradients in a scheme that fully avoids propagator storage and significantly reduces memory requirements. Separately, we present improvements to numerical state propagation to enhance runtime performance.

Such descriptions rely on a set of topological invariants, generally referred to as topological charges, which form a characteristic class in the mathematical structure of fiber bundles associated with the Bloch wavefunctions. For example, the celebrated Chern number and its variants belong to the Chern class, characterizing topological charges for complex Bloch wavefunctions. Nevertheless, under the space-time inversion symmetry, Bloch wavefunctions can be purely real in the entire momentum space; consequently, their topological classification does not fall into the Chern class, but requires another characteristic class known as the Stiefel-Whitney class. Here, in a three-dimensional acoustic crystal, we demonstrate a topological nodal-line semimetal that is characterized by a doublet of topological charges, the first and second Stiefel-Whitney numbers, simultaneously. Such a doubly charged nodal line gives rise to a doubled bulk-boundary correspondence: while the first Stiefel-Whitney number induces ordinary drumhead states of the nodal line, the second Stiefel-Whitney number supports hinge Fermi arc states at odd inversion-related pairs of hinges. These results establish the Stiefel-Whitney topological charges as intrinsic topological invariants for topological materials, with their unique bulk-boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework of topological band theory.

    "abstract": "Controlling the charge density in low-dimensional materials with an electrostatic potential is a powerful tool to explore and influence their electronic and optical properties. Conventional solid gates impose strict geometrical constraints to the devices and often absorb electromagnetic radiation in the infrared (IR) region. A powerful alternative is ionic liquid (IL) gating. This technique only needs a metallic electrode in contact with the IL and the highest achievable electric field is limited by the electrochemical interactions of the IL with the environment. Despite the excellent gating properties, a large number of ILs is hardly exploitable for optical experiments in the mid-IR region, because they typically suffer from low optical transparency and degradation in ambient conditions. Here, we report the realization of two electrolytes based on bromide ILs dissolved in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). We demonstrate that such electrolytes can induce state-of-the-art charge densities as high as $20\\times10^{15}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Thanks to the low water absorption of PMMA, they work both in vacuum and in ambient atmosphere after a simple vacuum curing. Furthermore, our electrolytes can be spin coated into flat thin films with optical transparency in the range from 600 cm$^{-1}$ to 4000 cm$^{-1}$. Thanks to these properties, the electrolytes are excellent candidates to fill the gap as versatile gating layers for electronic and mid-IR optoelectronic devices. ",

Here, we successfully prepared semiconducting copper selenide (CuSe) confined quantum dots with abundant vacancies and systematically investigated their photoelectrochemical characteristics. Photoluminescence characterizations reveal that the presence of vacancies reduces the emission intensity dramatically, indicating a low recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers due to the self-introduced trapping states within the bandgap. In addition, the ultra-low charge transfer resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy implies the efficient charge transfer of CuSe semiconducting quantum dots-based photoelectrocatalysts, which is guaranteed by the high conductivity of their confined structure as revealed by room-temperature electrical transport measurements. Such high conductivity and low photogenerated charge carriers recombination rate, combined with high-density active sites and confined structure, guaranteeing the remarkable photoelectrocatalytic performance and stability as manifested by photoelectrocatalysis characterizations.

Examples range from quantum communication, sensing and computation, including optical neural networks, optical reservoir computing or simulation of complex physical systems. The realization of such routines requires high levels of control and tunability of the parameters that define the operations carried out by the device. This requirement becomes particularly crucial in light of recent technological improvements in integrated photonic technologies, which enable the implementation of progressively larger circuits embedding a considerable amount of tunable parameters. In this work, we formulate efficient procedures for the characterization of optical circuits in the presence of imperfections that typically occur in physical experiments, such as unbalanced losses and phase instabilities in the input and output collection stages. The algorithm aims at reconstructing the transfer matrix that represents the optical interferometer without making any strong assumptions about its internal structure and encoding. We show the viability of this approach in an experimentally relevant scenario, defined by a tunable integrated photonic circuit, and we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Our findings can find application in a wide range of optical setups, based both on bulk and integrated configurations. ",

    "abstract": "The concept of soliton gas was introduced in 1971 by V. Zakharov as an infinite collection of weakly interacting solitons in the framework of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. In this theoretical construction of a diluted soliton gas, solitons with random parameters are almost non-overlapping. More recently, the concept has been extended to dense gases in which solitons strongly and continuously interact. The notion of soliton gas is inherently associated with integrable wave systems described by nonlinear partial differential equations like the KdV equation or the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation that can be solved using the inverse scattering transform. Over the last few years, the field of soliton gases has received a rapidly growing interest from both the theoretical and experimental points of view. In particular, it has been realized that the soliton gas dynamics underlies some fundamental nonlinear wave phenomena such as spontaneous modulation instability and the formation of rogue waves. The recently discovered deep connections of soliton gas theory with generalized hydrodynamics have broadened the field and opened new fundamental questions related to the soliton gas statistics and thermodynamics. We review the main recent theoretical and experimental results in the field of soliton gas. The key conceptual tools of the field, such as the inverse scattering transform, the thermodynamic limit of finite-gap potentials and the Generalized Gibbs Ensembles are introduced and various open questions and future challenges are discussed.
