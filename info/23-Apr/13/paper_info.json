    "abstract": "Background: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that combines principles of physics, math, and engineering to look inside humans and animals, hence delivering a lifesaving technology. However, resource-poor regions aiming to expand access to MRI suffer from a lack of imaging expertise. Education of a new generation of MRI technicians and researchers in these regions is needed to make this technology more equitable and sustainable around the world. Results: We developed Virtual Scanner Games, an open-source web application that allows students to explore fundamental concepts in MRI. Four modules illustrated imaging basics, imaging biology, imaging physics, and imaging design. Feedback was collected from high school and early college students along with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and doctoral students working in the field of MRI. Conclusions: We have shown a collection of games that can be used independently by high school students and people with no imaging background; they could also be used as demonstration tools in formal courses. Further assessment of their educational value through longer term usage is needed. ",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces have extensive potential in acoustic cloaking, optical scattering, and electromagnetic antenna due to their unprecedented properties and the ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metasurfaces have attracted significant research attention because of their on-demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. They normally achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which often lead to changes in overall dimensions. This also demands the corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, which could be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area-preserving active metasurfaces with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, we present magneto-mechanical bilayer metasurfaces that demonstrate area density tunability with area-preserving capability. The bilayer metasurfaces primarily consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under an external magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metasurface to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and thus significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area-preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept to design area-preserving active metasurfaces for broader practical applications. ",

    "abstract": "We report the observation of nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions between two different branches of the dispersion relation of hydrodynamic waves, namely the gravity-capillary and sloshing modes. These atypical interactions are investigated within a torus of fluid for which the sloshing mode can be easily excited. A triadic resonance instability is then observed due to this three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism. An exponential growth of the instability and phase locking are evidenced. The efficiency of this interaction is found to be maximal when the gravity-capillary phase velocity matches the group velocity of the sloshing mode. For a stronger forcing, additional waves are generated by a cascade of three-wave interactions populating the wave spectrum. Such a three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism is probably not restricted to hydrodynamics and could be of interest in other systems involving several propagation modes. ",

The high sensitivity of the biosensor originates from the sharp reflected peak caused by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) mode. This structure achieves the tunability of sensitivity due to that the reflectance could be modulated by the Fermi energy of 3D DSM. Besides, it is found that the sensitivity curve depends heavily on the structural parameters of 3D DSM. After parameter optimization, we obtained sensitivity over 100{\\deg}/RIU for liquid biosensor. We believe this simple structure provides a reference idea for realizing high sensitivity and tunable biosensor device. ",

The perturbed Hamiltonian is composed of a free particle Hamiltonian plus a perturbing electric potential such that the Schr$\\ddot{o}$dinger evolution in time $T$, the unitary evolution operator of the unperturbed system after truncation to a finite number of energy levels, approximates a given unitary gate such as the quantum Fourier transform gate. The idea is to truncate the half-wave Fourier sine series to $M$ terms in the spatial variable $\\mathbf x$ before extending the potential as a Dyson series in the interaction picture to compute the evolution operator matrix elements up to the linear and quadratic integral functionals of $ \\mathbf V_n(t)'$s. As a result, we used the Dyson series with the Frobenius norm to reduce the difference between the derived gate energy and the given gate energy, and we determined the temporal performance criterion by plotting the noise-to-signal energy ratio (NSER). A mathematical explanation for a quantum gate's magnetic control has also been provided. In addition, we provide a mathematical explanation for a quantum gate that uses magnetic control. ",

Neutral atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising quantum computing platform, featuring coherent control over hundreds of qubits and any-to-any gate connectivity in a flexible, dynamically reconfigurable architecture. The major outstanding challenge has been to reduce errors in entangling operations mediated through Rydberg interactions. Here we report the realization of two-qubit entangling gates with 99.5% fidelity on up to 60 atoms in parallel, surpassing the surface code threshold for error correction. Our method employs fast single-pulse gates based on optimal control, atomic dark states to reduce scattering, and improvements to Rydberg excitation and atom cooling. We benchmark fidelity using several methods based on repeated gate applications, characterize the physical error sources, and outline future improvements. Finally, we generalize our method to design entangling gates involving a higher number of qubits, which we demonstrate by realizing low-error three-qubit gates. By enabling high-fidelity operation in a scalable, highly connected system, these advances lay the groundwork for large-scale implementation of quantum algorithms, error-corrected circuits, and digital simulations.

Despite the non-chirality of both the spheres and cylinders, the self-assembled system can exhibit chirality due to spontaneous symmetry breaking during the assembly process. We have investigated the circular dichroism effects of the system and have found that, for both perfect electric conductor and dielectric spheres, the system can display dual-polarization photonic band gaps for circularly polarized light at normal incidence along the axis of the helix. Further, we have examined how the polarization band gap size depends on the dielectric constant of the spheres and the packing fraction of the cylinders.

By means of a parent quantum many-body description, we demonstrate that such driven systems are well captured by an effective NLSE with emergent nonlinearities, which can be finely controlled by tuning the driving sequence. We first consider a general class of two-mode nonlinear systems - relevant to optical Kerr cavities, waveguides and Bose-Einstein condensates - where we find an emergent four-wave mixing nonlinearity, which originates from pair-hopping processes in the parent quantum picture. Tuning this drive-induced nonlinearity is shown to modify the phase-space topology, which can be detected through relative population and phase measurements. We then couple individual (two-mode) dimers in view of designing extended lattice models with unconventional nonlinearities and controllable pair-hopping processes. Following this general dimerization construction, we obtain an effective lattice model with drive-induced interactions, whose ground-state exhibits orbital order, chiral currents and emergent magnetic fluxes through the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry. We analyze these intriguing properties both in the weakly-interacting (mean-field) regime, captured by the effective NLSE, and in the strongly-correlated quantum regime. Our general approach opens a route for the engineering of unconventional optical nonlinearities in photonic devices and controllable drive-induced interactions in ultracold quantum matter. ",

The streaming and collision steps are both achieved via unitary operators. A quantized version of the nonlinear collision term has been implemented, without introducing variables of discrete densities coupled from neighbouring sites, unlike the classical Carleman technique.

Commun. 6, 7370 (2015), where the authors experimentally tweeze cavity solitons in a passive loop of optical fiber, we study the amenability to tweezing of cavity solitons as the properties of a localized tweezer are varied. The system is modeled by the Lugiato-Lefever equation, a variant of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We produced an effective, localized, trapping tweezer potential by assuming a Gaussian phase-modulation of the holding beam. The potential for tweezing is then assessed as the width, the total (temporal) displacement and speed of the tweezer are varied and corresponding phase diagrams are presented. As the relative speed of the tweezer is increased we find four possible dynamical scenarios: (a) successful tweezing, (b) release and recapture, (c) destruction due to absorption, and (d) release without recapture of the cavity soliton. We also deploy a non-conservative variational approximation (NCVA) based on a Lagrangian description which reduces the original no-Hamiltonian partial differential equation to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations on the cavity soliton parameters. We show how the NCVA is capable of predicting the threshold in the tweezer parameters for successful tweezing. Through the numerical study of the Lugiato-Lefever equation and its NCVA reduction, we have developed a process to identify regions of successful tweezing which can aid in the experimental design and reliability of temporal tweezing used for information processing.
