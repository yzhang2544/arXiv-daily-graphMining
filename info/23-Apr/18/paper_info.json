    "title": "On Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals of Diatomic Molecular Spectroscopy",
    "abstract": "The interpretation of optical spectra requires thorough comprehension of quantum mechanics, especially understanding the concept of angular momentum operators. Suppose now that a transformation from laboratory-fixed to molecule-attached coordinates, by invoking the correspondence principle, induces reversed angular momentum operator identities. However, the foundations of quantum mechanics and the mathematical implementation of specific symmetries assert that reversal of motion or time reversal includes complex conjugation as part of anti-unitary operation. Quantum theory contraindicates sign changes of the fundamental angular momentum algebra. Reversed angular momentum sign changes are of a heuristic nature and are actually not needed in analysis of diatomic spectra. This review addresses sustenance of usual angular momentum theory, including presentation of straightforward proofs leading to falsification of the occurrence of reversed angular momentum identities. This review also summarizes aspects of a consistent implementation of quantum mechanics for spectroscopy with selected diatomic molecules of interest in astrophysics and in engineering applications.

The sensitivity of the method to microsecond pulses is shown to be sufficient to detect radio frequency Rabi frequencies of 2$\\pi$ x 0.44 MHz using a 480 kHz bandwidth at 108.9 GHz, demonstrating the ability to sense time-dependent signals suitable for radar and communications.

Conical intersections and corresponding non-adiabatic coupling can greatly affect molecular dynamics and chemical properties. In this paper, we predict significant or measurable non-adiabatic effects in an ultracold atom-ion charge-exchange reaction in the presence of laser-induced conical intersections (LICIs). We investigate the fundamental physics of these LICIs on molecular reactivity under unique conditions: those of relatively low laser intensity of $10^8$ W/cm$^2$ and ultracold temperatures below 1 mK. We predict irregular interference effects in the charge-exchange rate coefficients between K and Ca$^+$ as functions of laser frequency. These irregularities occur in our system due to the presence of two LICIs. To further elucidate the role of the LICIs on the reaction dynamics, we compare these rate coefficients with those computed for a system where the CIs have been ``removed''. In the laser frequency window, where conical interactions are present, the difference in rate coefficients can be as large as $10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/s. ",

We assess the performance of tNTA by analyzing the selective binding of tannic acid-modified gold nanoparticles (TaAuNPs) to herpes simplex viruses (HSV). Our results show that TaAuNPs bind specifically to HSV without causing substantial changes in the size or refractive index of the virus, suggesting that the binding does not cause virus disruption. Instead, the anti-viral properties of TaAuNPs appear to stem from direct particle binding to the virus. ",

    "abstract": "Tuning the mass density and bulk modulus independently is the key to manipulate the propagation of sound wave. Acoustic metamaterials provide a feasible method to realize various acoustic parameters. However, the relevant studies are mainly concentrated in air, and the huge impedance difference makes it difficult to directly extend these airborne structures to underwater application. Here, we propose a metafluid to realize independent manipulation of the mass density and bulk modulus underwater. The metafluid is composed of hollow regular polygons immersed in the water. By adjusting the side number of the hollow regular polygons and choosing proper materials, the effective mass density and bulk modulus of the metafluid could be modulated independently. Based on the flexible adjustment method, metafluids with same impedance but different sound velocities are designed and used to realize an underwater impedance-matched gradient index lens. In addition, by combining the proposed metafluid with other artificial structures, acoustic parameters with great anisotropy can be achieved, which is exemplified by the design and demonstration of an impedance-matched underwater acoustic carpet cloak. This work can expand the practicability of underwater metamaterials and pave the way for future potential engineering applications in the practical underwater devices. ",

    "abstract": "Refractive index is a fundamental electromagnetic (EM) parameter that can describe photonic continuous media (PCM) traditionally as either transparency or opacity. Recently, topological theory offers a new set of phases to characterize PCM as either trivial or nontrivial, by using topological invariant which are not direct to EM parameters. As all of optical properties in PCM should be related to EM parameters, we formulate a topological index based on EM parameters and establish its phase map in this work. The map can analytically describe the deterministic condition for a topologically nontrivial phase. Our findings indicate that the topology of 2D bi-anisotropic PCM is determined by the sign of the topological index. Another EM parameter of pseudo surface impedance is also introduced for the opaque regions of PCM, showing that the topological opacity has a full range of impedance values ranging from negative to positive, while the trivial case only has either negative or positive impedance. The simulation results show that an interface between two opacities with differing index signs can support robustly optical propagation of topological edge states. As the index only depends on EM parameters, it will pave an insightful way to further understand the intrinsic properties of photonic topology. ",

The two methods for calculating the electronic response function are applied. The first one uses direct integration over frequency to determine the response function. The diagonal form of the spectral function is the only assumption within the RPA framework, but the supercell calculations are very time-consuming. Therefore, we propose the method in which the response function is calculated in the plasmon pole approximation, and the GW contribution to the exchange-correlation energy is taken with a certain mixing constant. The value of the constant is found from the correspondence with experimental data. This makes it possible to obtain an accuracy comparable to the first method at significantly lower computational costs. The described method is used to calculate the formation energy of the neutral self-interstitial, vacancy and two divacansy structures in supercells of 214-217 silicon atoms. ",

    "abstract": "This article presents a weakly supervised machine learning method, which we call DAS-N2N, for suppressing strong random noise in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) recordings. DAS-N2N requires no manually produced labels (i.e., pre-determined examples of clean event signals or sections of noise) for training and aims to map random noise processes to a chosen summary statistic, such as the distribution mean, median or mode, whilst retaining the true underlying signal. This is achieved by splicing (joining together) two fibres hosted within a single optical cable, recording two noisy copies of the same underlying signal corrupted by different independent realizations of random observational noise. A deep learning model can then be trained using only these two noisy copies of the data to produce a near fully-denoised copy. Once the model is trained, only noisy data from a single fibre is required. Using a dataset from a DAS array deployed on the surface of the Rutford Ice Stream in Antarctica, we demonstrate that DAS-N2N greatly suppresses incoherent noise and enhances the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of natural microseismic icequake events. We further show that this approach is inherently more efficient and effective than standard stop/pass band filtering routines and a comparable self-supervised learning method based on masking individual DAS channels. Our preferred model for this task is lightweight, processing 30 seconds of data recorded at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz over 985 channels (approx. 1 km of fiber) in $<$1 s. Due to the high noise levels in DAS recordings, efficient data-driven denoising methods, such as DAS-N2N, will prove essential to time-critical DAS earthquake detection, particularly in the case of microseismic monitoring.

Tunable birefringent and dichromic materials are scarce and rarely available in high-quality thin films over wafer scales. In this paper, we report semiconducting, highly aligned, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) over 4\" wafers with normalized birefringence and dichroism values 0.09 and 0.58, respectively. The real and imaginary parts of the refractive index of the SWCNT films are tuned by up to 5.9% and 14.3% in the infrared at 2200 nm and 1660 nm, respectively, using electrostatic doping. Our results suggest that aligned SWCNTs are among the most anisotropic and tunable optical materials known and opens new avenues for their application in integrated photonics and telecommunications.

    "title": "A high-efficiency proton-boron fusion scheme taking into account the  effects of quantum degeneracy",
    "abstract": "The proton-boron (p-$^{11}$B) reaction is regarded as the holy grail of advanced fusion fuels, since the primary reaction produces three $\\alpha$ particles with few neutrons and induced radio-activities from second order reactions. Compared to the Deuterium-Tritium reaction a much higher reaction temperature is required. Moreover, bremsstrahlung energy losses due to the high nuclear charge of boron deem it seemingly apparent than a fusion reactor based on Deuterium-Tritium plasma in equilibrium is to say the least very difficult.It is becoming more appealing to collide intense laser beams or accelerated proton beams with a boron target to produce p-$^{11}$B reactions. The fusion yield of p-$^{11}$B reactions is closely related to proton beam parameters and boron target conditions such as density, temperature, and ingredients. Quantum degeneracy will increase fusion yields by reducing the stopping power of injected protons. In this work, we suggest a high-efficiency scheme for beam-target p-$^{11}$B fusions via injecting a MeV proton beam into a highly compressed quantum degenerated boron target. Such a boron target can be achieved via quasi-isentropic compression of solid boron by using precisely shaped laser pulses. Our results indicate that for densities ranging from $10^3$ to $10^4\\rho_s$, where $\\rho_s$ is the density of solid boron, contributions of bound and free electrons to the stopping of protons can be completely disregarded and dramatically reduced respectively. The result is an increase in fusion yield by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, in order to achieve multiplication factor $F$ greater than one, with $F$ defined as the ratio of output fusion energy to the energy of injected protons, it is found there exits a minimum possible density of boron target, which is $2.15 \\times 10^4 \\rho_s$ when the kinetic energy of injected protons is $0.8$ MeV.

On this basis, it provides a comparative analysis of viable quantum logical bivalent semantics and their classical counterparts, thereby showing that the truth-functional status of classical and quantum connectives is not as different as usually thought. Then, after pointing out the seemingly forgotten fact that bivalence in quantum logic can be maintained, albeit at the price of truth-functionality, it argues that Hellman (1980) fails to show that this lack of truth-functionality entails a change of meaning between classical and quantum logical connectives. Finally, the paper proposes a meaning-variance argument that fares better on our analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Timothy Williamson has argued that the applicability of classical mathematics in the natural and social sciences raises a problem for the adoption, in non-mathematical domains, of a wide range of non-classical logics, including quantum logics (QL). We first reconstruct the argument and present its restriction to the case of QL. Then we show that there is no inconsistency whatsoever between the application of classical mathematics to quantum phenomena and the use of QL in reasoning about them. Once we identify the premise in Williamson's argument that turns out to be false when restricted to QL, we argue that the same premise breaks down for a wider variety of non-classical logics. In the end, we also suggest that the alleged tension between these non-classical logics and applied classical mathematics betrays a misunderstanding of the nature of mathematical representation in science.

    "abstract": "Anderson localization is ubiquitous in wavy systems with strong static and uncorrelated disorder. The delicate destructive interference underlying Anderson localization is usually washed out in the presence of temporal fluctuations or aperiodic drives in the Hamiltonian, leading to delocalization and restoring transport. However, in one-dimensional lattices with off-diagonal disorder Anderson localization can persist for arbitrary time-dependent drivings that do not break a hidden conservation law originating from the chiral symmetry, leading to the dubbed 'localization without eigenstates'. Here it is shown that such an intriguing phenomenon can be observed in discrete-time photonic quantum walks with static disorder applied to the coin operator, and can be extended to non-Hermitian dynamics as well.

We emphasize that whereas Kochen-Specker's is essentially a no-go theorem, Gleason's provides a mathematical justification of Born's rule. Our extracontextual approach requires however a way to describe the ``Heisenberg cut''. Following an article by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products, this can be done by noticing that the usual formalism of quantum mechanics, associated with unitary equivalence of representations, stops working when countable infinities of particles (or degrees of freedom) are encountered. This is because the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space becomes uncountably infinite, leading to the loss of unitary equivalence, and to sectorisation. Such an intrinsically contextual approach provides a unified mathematical model including both quantum and classical physics, that appear as required incommensurable facets in the description of nature.

    "abstract": "Topological phases based on tight-binding models have been extensively studied in recent decades. By mimicking the linear combination of atomic orbitals in tight-binding models based on the evanescent couplings between resonators in classical waves, numerous experimental demonstrations of topological phases have been successfully conducted. However, in dielectric photonic crystals, the Mie resonances' states decay too slowly as $1/r$ when $r$ $\\to$ $\\infty$, leading to intrinsically different physical properties between tight-binding models and dielectric photonic crystals. Here, we propose a confined Mie resonance photonic crystal by embedding perfect electric conductors in between dielectric rods, leading to a perfectly matched band structure as the tight-binding models with nearest-neighbour couplings. As a consequence, disentangled band structure spanned by higher atomic orbitals is observed. Moreover, we also achieve a three-dimensional photonic crystal with a complete photonic bandgap and third-order topology based on our design. Our implementation provides a versatile platform for studying exotic higher-orbital bands and achieving tight-binding-like 3D topological photonic crystals. ",

Ever-growing interest in utilizing quantum resources in order to make highly sensitive measurements, prompted the researchers to describe polarized light in a quantum mechanical framework and build a quantum theory of polarimetry within this framework. In this work, inspired by the polarimetric studies in biological tissues, we study the ultimate limit of rotation angle estimation with a known rotation axis in a quantum polarimetric process, which consists of three quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. However, the diattenuator and depolarizer channels act on the probe state, which effectively can be thought of as a noise process. Finally the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is calculated and the effect of these noise channels and their ordering is studied on the estimation error of the rotation angle. ",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that extends the functionality of OCT by extracting moving red blood cell signals from surrounding static biological tissues. OCTA has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing skin microvasculature, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Most existing OCTA extraction algorithms, such as speckle variance (SV)- and eigen-decomposition (ED)-OCTA, implement a larger number of repeated (NR) OCT scans at the same position to produce high-quality angiography images. However, a higher NR requires a longer data acquisition time, leading to more unpredictable motion artifacts. In this study, we propose a vasculature extraction pipeline that uses only one-repeated OCT scan to generate OCTA images. The pipeline is based on the proposed Vasculature Extraction Transformer (VET), which leverages convolutional projection to better learn the spatial relationships between image patches. In comparison to OCTA images obtained via the SV-OCTA (PSNR: 17.809) and ED-OCTA (PSNR: 18.049) using four-repeated OCT scans, OCTA images extracted by VET exhibit moderate quality (PSNR: 17.515) and higher image contrast while reducing the required data acquisition time from ~8 s to ~2 s. Based on visual observations, the proposed VET outperforms SV and ED algorithms when using neck and face OCTA data in areas that are challenging to scan. This study represents that the VET has the capacity to extract vascularture images from a fast one-repeated OCT scan, facilitating accurate diagnosis for patients. ",

They are, however, often optimized to address a specific type of problems. Here, we present the design and implementation of a $^6$Li-based quantum gas platform that provides wide-ranging capabilities and is able to address a variety of quantum many-body problems. Our two-chamber architecture relies on a robust and easy-to-implement combination of gray molasses and optical transport from a laser-cooling chamber to a glass cell with excellent optical access. There, we first create unitary Fermi superfluids in a three-dimensional axially symmetric harmonic trap and characterize them using in situ thermometry, reaching temperatures below 20 nK. This allows us to enter the deep superfluid regime with samples of extreme diluteness, where the interparticle spacing is sufficiently large for direct single-atom imaging. Secondly, we generate optical lattice potentials with triangular and honeycomb geometry in which we study diffraction of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates, and show how going beyond the Kapitza-Dirac regime allows us to unambiguously distinguish between the two geometries. With the ability to probe quantum many-body physics in both discrete and continuous space, and its suitability for bulk and single-atom imaging, our setup represents an important step towards achieving a wide-scope quantum simulator.
