    "title": "Modeling inductive radio frequency coupling in powerful negative  hydrogen ion sources: optimizing the RF coupling",
    "abstract": "In the fusion experiment ITER powerful neutral beam injection (NBI) systems will be used. The NBI's core component is a negative hydrogen ion source, which is based on a modular concept. Eight cylindrical drivers, each having a volume of several liters, are attached to one common expansion and extraction region. Within the drivers an inductively coupled plasma is sustained by an external cylindrical coil at filling pressures not larger than 0.3 Pa. Radio frequency (RF) generators operating at a driving frequency of 1 MHz feed the coils via a matching network with powers of up to 100 kW per driver. These high powers entail high voltages, which make the ion source prone to electrical breakdowns and arcing, wherefore its reliability is reduced. Moreover, at the ITER prototype RF ion source not more than 60% of the power is absorbed by the plasma, whereas the rest is lost for heating the RF coil and conducting structures of the driver. To optimize the power coupling in the prototype source, a previously validated self-consistent fluid-electromagnetic model is applied. The optimization studies reveal a complex interplay between network losses (mainly caused by the skin effect and eddy currents), and nonlinear plasma phenomena, such as the RF Lorentz force. The model demonstrates promising optimization concepts for the RF coupling in future NBI ion sources. In particular, by increasing the axial driver length and the driving frequency it is possible to enhance the fraction of absorbed power to values around 90%. ",

    "abstract": "Improving the photon-spin conversion efficiency without polarization dependence is a major challenge in realizing quantum interfaces gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) for polarization-encoded photonic quantum network systems. Previously, we reported the design of an air-bridge bull's-eye cavity that enhances the photon absorption efficiency of an embedded gate-defined QD regardless of the photon polarization. Here, we numerically demonstrate that a further 1.6 times improvement in efficiency is possible by simply adjusting the distance of the substrate from the semiconductor slab where the bull's-eye structure is formed. Our analysis clarifies that the upward-preferred coupling and narrow far-field emission pattern realized by substrate-induced asymmetry enable the improvement. ",

    "abstract": "The predominant source of nonlinearity in most existing accelerators are sextupoles, which introduce nonlinear resonances. When the horizontal tune of an accelerator is near such a resonance line ($n\\nu_x$), stable fixed points (SFPs) may appear in the horizontal phase space to form a second closed orbit different from the \"zero\" closed orbit. The stable islands in phase space surrounding the SFPs are also referred as transverse resonance island \"buckets\" (TRIBs). However, the TRIBs are not always present near a resonance line in a storage ring. Necessary conditions for TRIBs formation will be discussed in this paper. A 6-GeV lattice with the horizontal tune near a 3rd-order resonance line at $3\\nu_{x}$=50 is then designed for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). After loading this lattice into CESR, the TRIBs are observed while adjusting the horizontal tune near the 3rd-order resonance, consistent with particle tracking simulations. TRIBs rotation in the horizontal phase space are also experimentally demonstrated with adjustment of a sextupole knob. These results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculation. ",

Carrier and amplitude modulation sidebands were simultaneously transmitted by the conversion resonator, yielding phase-locked superpositions of up to five transverse modes. Equivalently, an amplitude-modulated beam was converted into a beam that periodically moved across the transverse plane. Precise control over the spatial beam shape during oscillation was gained by independently altering the set of transverse modes and their respective powers, which demonstrated an increased level of control in the generation of transverse mode-locked states.

We use an antisymmetric artificial neural network, or neural quantum state, as an ansatz for the wavefunction and use machine learning techniques to variationally minimize the energy of systems from 2 to 6 particles. We provide extensive benchmarks with other many-body methods, including exact diagonalisation and the Hartree-Fock approximation. The neural quantum state provides the best energies across a wide range of interaction strengths. We find very different ground states depending on the sign of the interaction. In the non-perturbative repulsive regime, the system asymptotically reaches crystalline order. In contrast, the strongly attractive regime shows signs of bosonization. The neural quantum state continuously learns these different phases with an almost constant number of parameters and a very modest increase in computational time with the number of particles. ",

    "abstract": "Growing application space in optical communications, computing, and sensing continues to drive the need for high-performance integrated photonic components. Designing these on-chip systems with complex and application-specific functionality requires beyond what is possible with physical intuition, for which machine learning-based design methods have recently become popular. However, as the expensive computational requirements for physically accurate device simulations last a critical challenge, these methods typically remain limited in scalability and the optical design degrees of freedom they can provide for application-specific and arbitrary photonic integrated circuits. Here, we introduce a highly-scalable, physics-informed framework for the design of on-chip optical systems with arbitrary functionality based on a deep photonic network of custom-designed Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Using this framework, we design ultra-broadband power splitters and a spectral duplexer, each in less than two minutes, and demonstrate state-of-the-art experimental performance with less than 0.66 dB insertion loss and over 120 nm of 1-dB bandwidth for all devices. Our presented framework provides an essential tool with a tractable path towards the systematic design of large-scale photonic systems with custom and broadband power, phase, and dispersion profiles for use in multi-band optical applications including high-throughput communications, quantum information processing, and medical/biological sensing.

They combine long natural lifetimes with strong inter-atomic interactions and coupling to electromagnetic fields. Trapping individual CRAs is essential to harness these unique features. We report the first demonstration of CRAs laser-trapping in a programmable array of optical bottle beams. We observe the decay of a trapped Rubidium circular level over 5ms using a novel optical detection method. This first optical detection of alkali CRAs is both spatially- and level selective. We finally observe the mechanical oscillations of the CRAs in the traps. This work opens the route to the use of circular levels in quantum devices. It is also promising for quantum simulation and information processing using the full extent of Rydberg manifolds. ",

To improve numerical results, we explore the use of dynamical diffusion gauges in such implementations. This is achieved by benchmarking quantum dynamics of few-body systems against independent exact solutions. A diffusion gauge is implemented here as a so-called noise-matrix, which satisfies a matrix equation defined by the corresponding Fokker--Planck equation of the phase-space representation. For the physical systems with fermionic particles considered here, the numerical evaluation of the new diffusion gauges allows us to double the practical simulation time, compared with hitherto known analytic noise-matrices. This development may have far reaching consequences for future quantum dynamical simulations of many-body systems. ",

Mimicking such a process through periodic variations of external control parameters, we use a mean-field approach underpinned by exact numerical and analytical calculations to identify relevant physical processes and to determine the charging rate of the flywheel.

As a proof-of-principle demonstration we employ a photonic simulator to encode a single qutrit and manipulate it to perform the fusion and braiding properties of non-Abelian $D(S_3)$ anyons. The photonic technology allows us to perform the required non-unitary operations with much higher fidelity than what can be achieved with current quantum computers. Our approach can be directly generalised to larger systems or to different anyonic models, thus enabling advances in the exploration of quantum error correction and fundamental physics alike. ",
