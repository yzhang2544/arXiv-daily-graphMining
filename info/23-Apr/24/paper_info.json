    "abstract": "Thermal infrared (IR) radiation has attracted considerable attention due to its applications ranging from radiative cooling to thermal management. In this paper, we design a multi-band graphene-based metamaterial absorber compatible with infrared applications and radiative cooling performance. The proposed structure consists of the single-sized metal-insulator-metal (MIM) grating deposited on metal/insulator substrate and single-layer graphene. The system realizes a broadband perfect absorption ranging from 940 nm to 1498 nm and a narrowband perfect absorption at the resonance wavelength of 5800 nm. Meanwhile, the absorptivity of the structure is suppressed within the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) ranges. Furthermore, to demonstrate the tunability of the structure, an external voltage gate is applied to the single-layer graphene. It is shown that, by varying the chemical potential of graphene layer from 0 eV to 1 eV , the absorption resonances at the mid-infrared (MIR) range can shift toward the shorter wavelengths. It is also observed that the structure can possess an average net cooling power over 18 at the ambient temperature, when is varied from 0 eV to 1 eV. Finally, we investigate the overall performances of the structure as a function of temperature to realize thermal infrared applications. ",

    "abstract": "In the double-cone ignition scheme, compressed fuels in two head-on cones are ejected to collide, forming a colliding plasma with an isochoric distribution for rapid heating by high flux fast electrons from picosecond petawatt laser beams in the perpendicular direction from the cone axis. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum degeneracy on the transport of fast electrons in the colliding plasma, which rapidly evolves from the quantum degenerate in the outer region of the plasma to the classical state in the concentric core region heated by the colliding fronts of the plasma jets. With large scale particle-in-cell simulations, it is found that the self-generated magnetic field generated by the transport of fast electrons in the quantum degenerate state at the outer region is much stronger than in the corresponding classical state with the same fuel density in the core region. Theoretical analysis of the growth of the self-generated magnetic field is developed to explain the simulation results. Such strong self-generated magnetic fields in the quantum degenerate states can pinch the axially injected fast electrons to deposit their energy in the concentric core region, improving the heating efficiency for fast ignition.

In this scheme, the expansion of the laser beam after the focal position enlarges the size of wakefield bubble, which reduces the effective phase velocity of the wake and triggers injection of plasma electrons. This scheme injects a relatively long beam with high charge. The energy spread of the injected beam can be minimized if an optimal acceleration distance is chosen so that the beam chirp is suppressed. Particle-in-cell simulations indicate that electron beams with the charge in the order of nanocoulomb, the energy spread of $\\sim 1\\%$, and the normalized emittance of $\\rm \\sim 0.1\\ mm\\cdot mrad$ can be generated in uniform plasma using $\\sim 100\\ \\rm TW$ laser pulses. An empirical formula is also given for predicting the beam charge. This injection scheme, with a very simple setup, paves the way towards practical high-quality laser wakefield accelerators for table-top electron and radiation sources. ",

Here, we merge the two technologies in a ring semiconductor laser and demonstrate a new paradigm for free-running soliton formation, called Nozaki-Bekki soliton. These dissipative waveforms emerge in a family of traveling localized dark pulses, known within the famed complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We show that Nozaki-Bekki solitons are structurally-stable in a ring laser and form spontaneously with tuning of the laser bias -- eliminating the need for an external optical pump. By combining conclusive experimental findings and a complementary elaborate theoretical model, we reveal the salient characteristics of these solitons and provide a guideline for their generation. Beyond the fundamental soliton circulating inside the ring laser, we demonstrate multisoliton states as well, verifying their localized nature and offering an insight into formation of soliton crystals. Our results consolidate a monolithic electrically-driven platform for direct soliton generation and open a door for a new research field at the junction of laser multimode dynamics and Kerr parametric processes.

    "abstract": "We have studied the effect of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) on the ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and microwave dielectric properties of Ba-substituted PZT (BPZT), deposited by pulsed laser deposition. CMP allowed for the reduction of the root mean square surface roughness of 600 nm thick BPZT films from 12.1nm to 0.79 nm. Ammonium peroxide (SC-1) cleaning was effective to remove Si CMP residuals. Measurements of the ferroelectric hysteresis after CMP indicated that the ferroelectric properties of BPZT were only weakly affected by CMP, while the piezoelectric d33 coefficient and the microwave permittivity were reduced slightly by 10%. This can be attributed to the formation of a thin dead layer at the BPZT surface. Moreover, the intrinsic dielectric permittivity at microwave frequencies between 1 and 25 GHz was not influenced by CMP, whereas the dead layer series capacitance decreased by 10%. The results indicate that the CMP process can be used to smoothen the BPZT surface without affecting the film properties strongly. ",

    "abstract": "Fundamental knowledge of scattering in granular compacts is essential to ensure accuracy of spectroscopic measurements and determine material characteristics such as size and shape of scattering objects. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed to investigate the effect of particle size and concentration on scattering in specially fabricated compacts consisting of borosilicate microspheres in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix. As expected, increasing particle size leads to an increase in overall scattering contribution. At low concentrations, the scattering contribution increases linearly with concentration. Scattering increases linearly at low concentrations, saturates at higher concentrations with a maximum level depending on particle size, and that the onset of saturation is independent of particle size. The effective refractive index becomes sublinear at high particle concentrations and exceeds the linear model at maximum density, which can cause errors in calculations based on it, such as porosity. The observed phenomena are attributed to the change in the fraction of photons propagating ballistically versus being scattered. At low concentrations, photons travel predominately ballistically through the PTFE matrix. At high concentrations, the photons again propagate ballistically through adjacent glass microspheres. In the intermediate regime, photons are predominately scattered. ",

Our eventual goal is to use this interferometer for geodetic applications including local tie measurements. The GNSS element of the interferometer uses a unique software-defined receiving system and modified commercial geodetic-quality GNSS antenna. We ran three observing sessions in 2022 between a 25 m radio telescope in Fort Davis, Texas (FD-VLBA), a transportable GNSS antenna placed within 100 meters, and a GNSS antenna placed at a distance of about 9 km. We have detected a strong interferometric response with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of over 1000 from Global Positioning System (GPS) and Galileo satellites. We also observed natural radio sources including Galactic supernova remnants and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) located as far as one gigaparsec, thus extending the range of sources that can be referenced to a GNSS antenna by 18 orders of magnitude. These detections represent the first observations made with a GNSS antenna to radio telescope interferometer. We have developed a novel technique based on a Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solution of the recorded GNSS signal that allows us to extend integration time at 1.5 GHz to at least 20 minutes without any noticeable SNR degradation when a rubidium frequency standard is used.

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore the electron transition mechanism and optical properties of the popular red fluorescent protein mCherry. By examining the charge transfer spectrum and combining it with the mCherry hole-electron distribution, we identify that the charge transfer between the phenolate and imidazolinone loops significantly contributes to the absorption spectrum. Quantitative analysis of charge transfer shows that, overall, the electrons are transferred to the C16 atom in the middle of phenolate and the imidazolinone loops during absorption. We speculate that C16 may also absorb protons to enable the photoconversion of mCherry in the excited state, similar to the blinking mechanism of IrisFP. In addition, we further investigated the optical properties of mcherry in the external field by polarizability (hyperpolarizability), showing the anisotropy of the polarization, the first hyperpolarization and the second hyperpolarization by unit spherical representation. Our results suggest that significant polarization and second hyperpolarizability occur when the field direction and electron transfer direction are aligned. We also analyzed the polarizability and first hyperpolarizabilities for different external fields. The polarizability mutated when the external field satisfies the S_0,min-> S_1 transition. Finally, the study of the first hyperpolarizability shows that adjusting the appropriate field can lead to a linear photoelectric effect or second harmonic generation of mCherry. These studies have certain reference values for various red fluorescent protein correlation simulations and experiments because of the similarity of the red fluorescent protein. ",

The resulting device is a 1x1 filter, reflecting light back in the input waveguide at resonating wavelengths in the passbands, and transmitting light in the output waveguide at all other non-resonating wavelengths. Different implementations of the filter have been designed and fabricated on a micron-scale silicon photonics platform. They are based on compact Euler bends - either U-bends or L-bends - and Multi-Mode Interferometers as splitters for the ring resonators. Different finesse values have been achieved by using either 50:50 MMIs in conjunction with 85:15 MMIs or 85:15 MMIs in conjunction with 95:05 double MMIs. Unlike ordinary lowest order directional couplers, the MMIs couple most of the power in the cross-port which make them particularly suitable for the topology of the self-coupled ring, which would otherwise require a waveguide crossing. Experimental results are presented, showing good agreement with simulations. The proposed devices can find applications as wavelength-selective reflectors for relatively broad-band lasers or used as 2x2 add-drop filters when two exact replicas of the device are placed on the arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

    "abstract": "The traditional, standard approach to quantum theory is to assume that the theory ``really'' contains only unitary physical dynamics--i.e., that the only physically quantifiable evolution is that given by the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. This leads to two distinct classes of interpretations for the standard theory in its orthodox form: (i) an Everettian-type approach assuming that all mutually exclusive outcomes occur in different ``branches'' of the universe; or (ii) single-outcome approaches that assume a ``projection postulate'' (PP) with no accompanying physical account within quantum theory. A contrasting, unorthodox approach is to suggest forms of quantum theory that involve physical non-unitarity; these are called ``objective collapse models.'' Among these are Penrose's theory of gravitation-induced collapse and the Transactional Interpretation. The primary focus of this paper is an example demonstrating that standard quantum theory (with or without the projection postulate) can in-principle yield empirically consequential inconsistencies. Thus, it appears that for quantum theory to be viable in a realist sense (as opposed to being an instrumentalist protocol in which inconsistencies are evaded by changing the protocol), it must possess genuine, physical non-unitarity yielding well-defined single outcomes. This leads to the conclusion that objective collapse models should be more seriously considered. ",

One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find surprising agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.

    "abstract": "Devising efficient communication in a network consisting of multiple transmitters and receivers is a problem of immense importance in communication theory. Interestingly, resources in the quantum world have been shown to be very effective in enhancing the performance of communication networks. In this work, we study entanglement-assisted communication over classical network channels. When there is asymmetry such that noise introduced by the channel depends on the input alphabets, non communicating senders may exploit shared entangled states to overcome the noise. We consider multiple access channels, an essential building block for many complex networks, and develop an extensive framework for n-senders and 1-receiver multiple access channels based on nonlocal games. We obtain generic results for computing correlation assisted sum-capacities of these channels. The considered channels introduce less noise on winning and more noise on losing the game, and the correlation assistance is classified as local (L), quantum (Q), or no-signaling (NS). Furthermore, we consider a broad class of multiple access channels such as depolarizing ones that admix a uniform noise with some probability and prove general results on their sum-capacities. Finally, we apply our analysis to three specific depolarizing multiple access channels based on Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt, magic square, and Mermin-GHZ nonlocal games. In all three cases we find significant enhancements in sum-capacities on using nonlocal correlations. We obtain either exact expressions for sum-capacities or suitable upper and lower bounds on them. The general framework developed in this work has much wider applicability and the specificity studied in details are some illustrative examples to compare with recent studies in this direction. ",

By considering a technologically relevant system composed of two diamond surfaces with different degrees of passivation, we show that the presented method can be used not only for monitoring in real-time tribolochemical phenomena such as the tribologically-induced surface graphitization and passivation effects but also for estimating realistic friction coefficients. This opens the way to in silico experiments of tribology to test materials to reduce friction prior to that in real labs. ",
