    "abstract": "Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have recently emerged as a promising platform for infrared nanophotonics. A significant challenge in the design of ENZ-based optics is to control the dispersion of ENZ modes, which otherwise have a flat profile near the ENZ frequency. Strong coupling with an optical cavity is a promising approach to ENZ dispersion engineering, which however has limitations due to the lack of tunability or nanofabrication demands of the cavity employed. Here, we theoretically and numerically show that much of the limitations of previous demonstrations can be overcome by strongly coupling the ENZ mode to an unpatterned Fabry-Perot cavity. We demonstrate this unprecedented ENZ dispersion control in coupled cavities by designing tunable infrared polarizers that can absorb s- and reflect p-polarized components, or vice versa, for almost any oblique angle of incidence, i.e. omnidirectional polarizers. The feasibility of active control is also demonstrated using a phase change material within the cavity, which predicts dynamic switchability of polariton dispersions across multiple resonant levels at mid-infrared wavelengths. These results are expected to advance the current understanding of strongly coupled ENZ interactions and demonstrate their potential in tailoring dispersions for active and passive control of light.

    "abstract": "Ultra-thin multimode optical fiber imaging technology promises next-generation medical endoscopes that provide high image resolution deep in the body (e.g. blood vessels, brain). However, this technology suffers from severe optical distortion. The fiber's transmission matrix (TM) calibrates for this distortion but is sensitive to bending and temperature so must be measured immediately prior to imaging, i.e. \\emph{in vivo} and thus with access to a single end only. We present a neural network (NN)-based approach that quickly reconstructs transmission matrices based on multi-wavelength reflection-mode measurements. We introduce a custom loss function insensitive to global phase-degeneracy that enables effective NN training. We then train two different NN architectures, a fully connected NN and convolutional U-Net, to reconstruct $64\\times64$ complex-valued fiber TMs through a simulated single-ended optical fiber with $\\leq 4\\%$ error. This enables image reconstruction with $\\leq 8\\%$ error. This TM recovery approach shows advantages compared to conventional TM recovery methods: 4500 times faster; robustness to 6\\% fiber perturbation during characterization; operation with non-square TMs and no requirement for prior characterization of reflectors.

    "abstract": "We propose and demonstrate a novel scheme for optical arbitrary waveform measurement (OAWM) that exploits chip-scale Kerr soliton combs as highly scalable multiwavelength local oscillators (LO) for ultra-broadband full-field waveform acquisition. In contrast to earlier concepts, our approach does not require any optical slicing filters and thus lends itself to efficient implementation on state-of-the-art high-index-contrast integration platforms such as silicon photonics. The scheme allows to measure truly arbitrary waveforms with high accuracy, based on a dedicated system model which is calibrated by means of a femtosecond laser with known pulse shape. We demonstrated the viability of the approach in a proof-of-concept experiment by capturing an optical waveform that contains multiple 16 QAM and 64 QAM wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) data signals with symbol rates of up to 80 GBd, reaching overall line rates of up to 1.92 Tbit/s within an optical acquisition bandwidth of 610 GHz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest bandwidth that has so far been demonstrated in an OAWM experiment. ",

One of the studied possibilities is FCC (Future Circular Collider), a 100 km long collider at CERN. The feasibility study of this future proposed accelerator implies the definition of tolerances on magnets imperfections and of the strategies of correction in order to guarantee the target performances of the High Energy Booster ring. The efficiency of the correction scheme, used to control the orbit, directly bounds the corrector needs and magnet tolerances. Analytic formulae give a first estimation of the average rms value of the required linear correctors' strengths and of the allowed magnets misalignments and field quality along the entire ring. The distribution of the correctors along the ring is simulated in order to verify the quality of the residual orbit after the proposed correction strategy and compared with the analytical predictions. First specifications of the orbit correctors strength and tolerances for the alignment of the main elements of the ring are presented. The limits of the studied correction scheme and method are also discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Monolithic CMOS sensors in a 65 nm imaging technology are being investigated by the CERN EP Strategic R&D Programme on Technologies for Future Experiments for an application in particle physics. The appeal of monolithic detectors lies in the fact that both sensor volume and readout electronics are integrated in the same silicon wafer, providing a reduction in production effort, costs and scattering material. The Tangerine Project WP1 at DESY participates in the Strategic R&D Programme and is focused on the development of a monolithic active pixel sensor with a time and spatial resolution compatible with the requirements for a future lepton collider vertex detector. By fulfilling these requirements, the Tangerine detector is suitable as well to be used as telescope planes for the DESY-II Test Beam facility. The project comprises all aspects of sensor development, from the electronics engineering and the sensor design using simulations, to laboratory and test beam investigations of prototypes. Generic TCAD Device and Monte-Carlo simulations are used to establish an understanding of the technology and provide important insight into performance parameters of the sensor. Testing prototypes in laboratory and test beam facilities allows for the characterization of their response to different conditions. By combining results from all these studies it is possible to optimize the sensor layout. This contribution presents results from generic TCAD and Monte-Carlo simulations, and measurements performed with test chips of the first sensor submission. ",

This is typically achieved through tomography, which combines multiple two-dimensional images of the same object captured at different orientations. However, this serial imaging method prevents single-shot acquisition in imaging experiments at free electron lasers. In the present experiment, we report on a new approach to 3D imaging using extreme-ultraviolet radiation. In this method, two EUV pulses hit simultaneously an isolated 3D object from different sides, generating independent coherent diffraction patterns, resulting in two distinct bidimensional views obtained via phase retrieval. These views are then used to obtain a 3D reconstruction using a ray tracing algorithm. This EUV stereoscopic imaging approach, similar to the natural process of binocular vision, provides sub-$\\mu$m spatial resolution and single shot capability. Moreover, ultrafast time resolution and spectroscopy can be readily implemented, a further extension to X-ray wavelengths can be envisioned as well. ",

    "abstract": "Here, we investigate the role of the interlayer magnetic ordering of CrSBr in the framework of $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculations and by using optical spectroscopy techniques. These combined studies allow us to unambiguously determine the nature of the optical transitions. In particular, photoreflectance measurements, sensitive to the direct transitions, have been carried out for the first time. We have demonstrated that optically induced band-to-band transitions visible in optical measurement are remarkably well assigned to the band structure by the momentum matrix elements and energy differences for the magnetic ground state (A-AFM). In addition, our study reveals significant differences in electronic properties for two different interlayer magnetic phases. When the magnetic ordering of A-AFM to FM is changed, the crucial modification of the band structure reflected in the direct-to-indirect band gap transition and the significant splitting of the conduction bands along the $\\Gamma-Z$ direction are obtained. In addition, Raman measurements demonstrate a splitting between the in-plane modes $B^2_{2g}$/$B^2_{3g}$, which is temperature dependent and can be assigned to different interlayer magnetic states, corroborated by the DFT+U study. Moreover, the $B^2_{2g}$ mode has not been experimentally observed before. Finally, our results point out the origin of interlayer magnetism, which can be attributed to electronic rather than structural properties. Our results reveal a new approach for tuning the optical and electronic properties of van der Waals magnets by controlling the interlayer magnetic ordering in adjacent layers. ",

Here, we present a new class of clamped OMCs realizing -- for the first time -- optomechanical interactions in the resolved-sideband regime required for quantum transduction.

Here, we show how plasmonic nano-cavities activate anti-Stokes PL in WSe$_2$ monolayers through resonant excitation of a dark exciton. The tightly confined plasmonic fields excite the out-of-plane transition dipole of the dark exciton, leading to light emission from the bright exciton at higher energy. Through statistical measurements on hundreds of plasmonic cavities, we show that coupling to the dark exciton is key to achieving a near hundred-fold enhancement of the upconverted PL intensity. This is further corroborated by experiments in which the laser excitation wavelength is tuned across the dark exciton. Finally, we show that an asymmetric nanoparticle shape and precise geometry are key for consistent activation of the dark exciton and efficient PL upconversion. Our work introduces a new excitation channel for anti-Stokes PL in WSe$_2$ and paves the way for large-area substrates providing optical cooling, anti-Stokes lasing, and radiative engineering of excitons.
