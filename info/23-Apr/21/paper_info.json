    "abstract": "A reconfigurable phononic crystal (PnC) is proposed where elastic properties can be modulated by rotation of asymmetric solid scatterers immersed in water. The scatterers are metallic rods with cross-section of 120{\\deg} circular sector. Orientation of each rod is independently controlled by an external electric motor that allows continuous variation of the local scattering parameters and dispersion of sound in the entire crystal. Due to asymmetry of the scatterers, the crystal band structure possesses highly anisotropic bandgaps. Synchronous rotation of all the scatterers by a definite angle changes regime of reflection to regime of transmission and vice versa. The same mechanically tunable structure functions as a gradient index medium by incremental, angular reorientation of rods along both row and column, and, subsequently, can serve as a tunable acoustic lens, an acoustic beam splitter, and finally an acoustic beam steerer.

    "abstract": "Free-space optical systems are emerging for high data rate communication and transfer of information in indoor and outdoor settings. However, free-space optical communication becomes challenging when an occlusion blocks the light path. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a direct communication scheme, passing optical information around a fully opaque, arbitrarily shaped obstacle that partially or entirely occludes the transmitter's field-of-view. In this scheme, an electronic neural network encoder and a diffractive optical network decoder are jointly trained using deep learning to transfer the optical information or message of interest around the opaque occlusion of an arbitrary shape. The diffractive decoder comprises successive spatially-engineered passive surfaces that process optical information through light-matter interactions. Following its training, the encoder-decoder pair can communicate any arbitrary optical information around opaque occlusions, where information decoding occurs at the speed of light propagation. For occlusions that change their size and/or shape as a function of time, the encoder neural network can be retrained to successfully communicate with the existing diffractive decoder, without changing the physical layer(s) already deployed. We also validate this framework experimentally in the terahertz spectrum using a 3D-printed diffractive decoder to communicate around a fully opaque occlusion. Scalable for operation in any wavelength regime, this scheme could be particularly useful in emerging high data-rate free-space communication systems. ",

Particularly fabrication of the G center has been demonstrated in carbon-rich silicon upon conventional thermal annealing. However, the high-yield controlled fabrication of these emitters at the wafer-scale still requires the identification of a suitable thermodynamic pathway enabling its activation following ion implantation. Here we demonstrate the efficient activation of G centers in high-purity silicon substrates upon ns pulsed laser annealing. The proposed method enables the non-invasive, localized activation of G centers by the supply of short non-stationary pulses, thus overcoming the limitations of conventional rapid thermal annealing related to the structural metastability of the emitters. A finite-element analysis highlights the strong non-stationarity of the technique, offering radically different defect-engineering capabilities with respect to conventional longer thermal treatments, paving the way to the direct and controlled fabrication of emitters embedded in integrated photonic circuits and waveguides.

However, progress in this area hinges on the development of material platforms for high-performance polariton lasing, scalable and sustainable fabrication, and ultimately strategies for electrical pumping. Here, we show how introducing Schlieren textures in a liquid crystalline conjugated polymer and the associated microdomains of distinct chain orientation enable in-plane Anderson localization of polaritons. In high-Q distributed Bragg reflector microcavities, this strong localization facilitated polariton lasing at unprecedented thresholds of 136 fJ per pulse, thus providing a pathway to the study of fundamental effects at low polariton numbers. Anderson localization further permitted polariton lasing in more lossy metallic microcavities while maintaining a competitive lasing threshold. The facile fabrication of these cavities will drastically reduce the complexity of integrating polariton laser with other structures and the high conductivity of metallic mirrors provides a route to electrical pumping.

    "abstract": "Foundation models are large machine learning models that can tackle various downstream tasks once trained on diverse and large-scale data, leading research trends in natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. However, no foundation model exists for optical multilayer thin film structure inverse design. Current inverse design algorithms either fail to explore the global design space or suffer from low computational efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose the Opto Generative Pretrained Transformer (OptoGPT). OptoGPT is a decoder-only transformer that auto-regressively generates designs based on specific spectrum targets. Trained on a large dataset of 10 million designs, our model demonstrates remarkable capabilities: 1) autonomous global design exploration by determining the number of layers (up to 20) while selecting the material (up to 18 distinct types) and thickness at each layer, 2) efficient designs for structural color, absorbers, filters, distributed brag reflectors, and Fabry-Perot resonators within 0.1 seconds (comparable to simulation speeds), 3) the ability to output diverse designs, and 4) seamless integration of user-defined constraints. By overcoming design barriers regarding optical targets, material selections, and design constraints, OptoGPT can serve as a foundation model for optical multilayer thin film structure inverse design.

Further extending neural probe functionalities with integrated microfluidics is a direct approach to achieve neurochemical injection and sampling capabilities. In this work, we use two-photon polymerization to integrate microfluidic channels onto photonic neural probes with 3D printing. The photonic neural probes include silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides and grating emitters. The customizability of 3D printing enables a unique geometry of microfluidics that conforms to the shape of each neural probe, enabling integration of microfluidics with a variety of existing neural probes while avoiding the complexities of monolithic microfluidics integration. We demonstrate the photonic and fluidic functionalities of the neural probes via fluorescein injection in agarose gel and photoloysis of caged fluorescein in solution and in flxed brain tissue. ",

Three laser focuses are independently controlled with different paths, which are according to SVG, to optimize fabrication and promote time efficiency. The minimum structure width can be as low as 74 nm. Accompanied with a translation stage, a carp structure of 18.16 $\\mu$m by 24.35 $\\mu$m has been fabricated.

We employ ultrafast four-wave mixing spectroscopy to resonantly generate a quantum coherence in one trion complex, transfer it to and probe it in another trion configuration.

We consider quantum states of the electromagnetic field in a rectangular cavity with conducting boundary conditions, and calculate the cross-section for the merging of three quanta of cavity modes into a single one ($3 \\to 1$ process) as well as the scattering of two cavity mode quanta ($2 \\to 2$ process). We show that the amplitude of the merging process vanishes for a cavity with an arbitrary aspect ratio, and provide an explanation based on plane wave decomposition for cavity modes. Contrary, the scattering amplitude is nonzero for specific cavity aspect ratio. This $2 \\to 2$ scattering is a crucial elementary process for the generation of a quantum of a high-order harmonics with frequency $2\\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ in an interaction of two coherent states of cavity modes with frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. For this process we calculate the mean number of quanta in the final state in a model with dissipation, which supports the previous result of resonant higher-order harmonics generation in an effective field theory approach.

    "abstract": "Diamond colour centres are promising optically-addressable solid state spins that can be matter-qubits, mediate deterministic interaction between photons and act as single photon emitters. Useful quantum computers will comprise millions of logical qubits. To become useful in constructing quantum computers, spin-photon interfaces must therefore become scalable and be compatible with mass-manufacturable photonics and electronics. Here we demonstrate heterogeneous integration of NV centres in nanodiamond with low-fluorescence silicon nitride photonics from a standard 180 nm CMOS foundry process. Nanodiamonds are positioned over pre-defined sites in a regular array on a waveguide, in a single post-processing step. Using an array of optical fibres, we excite NV centres selectively from an array of six integrated nanodiamond sites, and collect the photoluminescence (PL) in each case into waveguide circuitry on-chip. We verify single photon emission by an on-chip Hanbury Brown and Twiss cross-correlation measurement, which is a key characterisation experiment otherwise typically performed routinely with discrete optics. Our work opens up a simple and effective route to simultaneously address large arrays of individual optically-active spins at scale, without requiring discrete bulk optical setups. This is enabled by the heterogeneous integration of NV centre nanodiamonds with CMOS photonics. ",
