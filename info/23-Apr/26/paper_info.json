The method uses equal-population sampling of the 1-D thermal distribution, sampling the 'inverse transform' of the cumulative distribution function, and is broadly applicable to normal distributions. We also discuss efficiencies from eliminating velocity classes which don't significantly contribute to observed atomic lines, and comment on the application of this method in 2- and 3-dimensions. ",

    "abstract": "Optical microscopy image plays an important role in scientific research through the direct visualization of the nanoworld, where the imaging mechanism is described as the convolution of the point spread function (PSF) and emitters. Based on a priori knowledge of the PSF or equivalent PSF, it is possible to achieve more precise exploration of the nanoworld. However, it is an outstanding challenge to directly extract the PSF from microscopy images. Here, with the help of self-supervised learning, we propose a physics-informed masked autoencoder (PiMAE) that enables a learnable estimation of the PSF and emitters directly from the raw microscopy images. We demonstrate our method in synthetic data and real-world experiments with significant accuracy and noise robustness. PiMAE outperforms DeepSTORM and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm in synthetic data tasks with an average improvement of 19.6\\% and 50.7\\% (35 tasks), respectively, as measured by the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) metric. This is achieved without prior knowledge of the PSF, in contrast to the supervised approach used by DeepSTORM and the known PSF assumption in the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. Our method, PiMAE, provides a feasible scheme for achieving the hidden imaging mechanism in optical microscopy and has the potential to learn hidden mechanisms in many more systems. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows the eye has a paravascular solute transport pathway driven by physiological pulsations resembling the brain. we developed synchronous multimodal imaging tools aimed at measuring the driving pulsations of the human eye. We used an eye-tracking functional eye camera (FEC) compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for measuring eye surface pulsations. Special optics enabled the integration of the FEC with a magnetic resonance compatible video ophthalmoscopy (MRcVO) for simultaneous retinal imaging along with functional eye MRI imaging (fMREye) reflecting BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) contrast. Upon optimizing the fMREye parameters, we thus measured the power of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) eye and brain pulsations by fast Fourier transform (FFT) power analysis. The human eye proved to pulsate in all three physiological pulse bands, most prominently in the respiratory (RESP) band. The FFT power means of physiological pulsation for two adjacent slices was significantly higher than in one-slice scans (RESP1 .vs RESP2; df = 5, p = 0.0174). FEC and MRcVO confirmed the respiratory pulsations at the eye surface and retina. we conclude that the human eye has three pulsation mechanisms, and multimodal imaging offers non-invasive monitoring of their effects in driving eye fluidics.

In this work, we demonstrate the existence of chiral topological electromagnetic edge states in Penrose-tiled photonic quasicrystals made of magneto-optical materials, without relying on the concept of bulk Bloch bands in momentum space. Despite the absence of bulk Bloch bands, which naturally defiles the conventional definition of topological invariants in momentum space characterizing these states, such as the Chern number, we show that some bandgaps in these photonic quasicrystals still could host unidirectional topological electromagnetic edge states immune to backscattering in both cylinders-in-air and holes-in-slab configurations. Employing a real-space topological invariant based on the Bott index, our calculations reveal that the bandgaps hosting these chiral topological edge states possess a nontrivial Bott index of $\\pm 1$, depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. Our work opens the door to the study of topological states in photonic quasicrystals. ",

Despite their widespread use, it is currently not known how tightly it is possible to three-dimensionally trap micro-particles with a given photon budget. Reaching this elusive limit would enable maximally-stiff particle trapping for precision measurements on the nanoscale, and photon-efficient tweezing of light-sensitive objects. Here we solve this problem by customising a trapping light field to suit a specific particle, with the aim of simultaneously optimising trap stiffness in all three dimensions. Initially taking a theoretical approach, we develop an efficient multi-parameter optimisation routine to design bespoke optical traps for a wide range of micro-particles. We show that the confinement volume of micro-spheres held in these sculpted traps can be reduced by one-to-two orders-of-magnitude in comparison to a conventional optical tweezer of the same power. We go on to conduct proof-of-principle experiments, and use a wavefront shaping inspired strategy to suppress the Brownian fluctuations of optically trapped micro-spheres in every direction concurrently, thus demonstrating order-of-magnitude reductions in their confinement volumes. Our work paves the way towards the fundamental limits of optical control over the mesoscopic realm. ",

These oscillators can be driven using either continuous-wave (CW) light, which only requires lining up of the pump frequency with OPO resonance, or pulsed light, which also mandates that the repetition rate of the pulse and free spectral range of the OPO cavity are carefully tuned to match each other. Advancements in nanophotonics have ignited interest in chip-scale OPOs, which enable low-footprint and high-efficiency solutions to broadband light generation. CW-pumped integrated OPO has been demonstrated using both $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ parametric oscillation. However, realizing pulse-driven on-chip OPO remains challenging, as microresonator cavities have limited tuning range in the FSR and resonance frequency compared to traditional bulk cavities. Here, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate a $\\chi^{(3)}$ pulse-driven OPO by using a tunable on-chip femtosecond pulse generator to synchronously pump the oscillator. The output frequency comb generated by our OPO has 30-GHz repetition rate, spans 2/5 of an octave and consists of over 1400 comb lines with a pump-to-comb conversion efficiency of 10%. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic crystals, material structures in which the dielectric function varies periodically in one, two, or three dimensions, can provide exquisite control over the propagation and confinement of light. By tailoring their band structure, exceptional optical effects can be achieved, such as slow light propagation or, through the creation of photonic bandgaps, optical cavities with both a high quality factor and a small mode volume. Photonic crystal cavities have been used to realize compact nano-lasers and achieve strong coupling to quantum emitters, such as semiconductor quantum dots, color centers, or cold atoms. A useful attribute of photonic crystals is the ability to create chirped mirrors. Chirping has underpinned advances in ultra-fast lasers based on bulk mirrors, but has yet to be fully exploited in integrated photonics, where it could provide a means to engineer otherwise unattainable dispersion profiles for a range of nonlinear optical applications, including soliton frequency comb generation. The vast majority of integrated resonators for frequency combs make use of microring geometries, where only waveguide width and height are varied to engineer dispersion. Generation of frequency combs has been demonstrated with one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities made of silicon nitride, but the low index contrast prevents formation of broad soliton combs. We overcome these challenges by using a photonic-crystal Fabry-P\\'erot resonator made of gallium phosphide, a material with a high refractive index and a Kerr nonlinearity 200 times larger than that of silicon nitride. We employ chirped photonic crystal mirrors to provide anomalous dispersion. With subharmonic pulsed pumping at an average power of 23.6 mW, we are able to access stable dissipative Kerr frequency combs. We demonstrate soliton formation with a 3-dB bandwidth of 3.0 THz, corresponding to a pulse duration of 60 fs. ",

At the limiting case of $\\alpha = 1$ the $M$-Wright function reduces to $M_{1}(t)=\\delta(t-1)$. We investigate numerically the behavior of this fractional-order delta function as well as it integral, the fractional-order unit-step function.

    "abstract": "Polariton chemistry holds promise for facilitating mode-selective chemical reactions, but the underlying mechanism behind the rate modifications observed under vibrational strong coupling is not well understood. Using the recently developed quantum transition path theory, we have uncovered a mechanism of resonant suppression of a thermal reaction rate in a simple model polaritonic system, consisting of a reactive mode in a bath confined to a lossless microcavity with a single photon mode. This mechanism was uncovered by resolving the quantum dynamical reactive pathways and identifying their rate limiting transitions. Upon inspecting the wavefunctions associated with the rate limiting transition, we observed the formation of a polariton and identified the concomitant rate suppression as due to hybridization between the reactive mode and the cavity mode, which inhibits bath-mediated tunneling during the reaction. The transition probabilities that define the quantum master equation can be directly translated into a visualisation of the corresponding polariton energy landscape. This landscape exhibits a double funnel structure, with a large barrier between the initial and final states. This mechanism of resonant rate suppression is found to be robust to model parameters and computational details, and thus expected to be general. ",

    "abstract": "The area of trapping the atoms or molecules using light has advanced tremendously in the last few decades. In contrast, the idea of controlling (not only trapping) the movement of atomic-sized particles using quantum mechanical matter waves is a completely new emerging area of particle manipulation. Though a single previous report has suggested the pulling of atoms based on matter wave tractor beams, an attempt is yet to be made to produce a lateral force (moving the atoms towards left or right) using this technique. This article demonstrates a matter wave-based manipulation scenario that gives rise to reversible lateral force on an atom due to the interaction energy of the quantum mechanical matter wave in the presence of a metal surface creating an asymmetrical set-up. For a symmetric set-up, no lateral force has been observed. We have performed several full wave simulations and analytical calculations on a particular set-up of Xenon scatterer atoms placed near a Copper surface, with two plane matter waves of Helium impinging in the direction parallel to the surface from two sides of the scatterer. By solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation and using the solution, quantum mechanical stress tensor formalism has been applied to compute the force acting on the particle. The full wave simulation results have been found in excellent agreement with the analytical calculations. The results for the adsorbed scatterer case suggests that our proposed technique can be an efficient cleaning procedure similar to electron-stimulated desorption for futuristic applications. ",

In this regard, Rydberg atoms can provide the required platform for simulating confinement-related physics. We exploit the flexibility offered by interacting Rydberg-dressed atoms to engineering modified spin-spin interactions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our numerical simulations show how Rydberg-dressed interactions can give rise to a variety of effective potentials that are suitable for hadron formation, which opens the possibility of simulating confinement physics with Rydberg platforms as a viable alternative to current trapped-ion experiments.

It is therefore crucial to develop effective strategies to generate and control spin or valley-locked spin currents, e.g., by exploiting the spin Hall or valley Hall effects. However, the scattering, and rapid dephasing of electrons pose major challenges to achieve macroscopic coherent spin currents and realistic spintronic or valleytronic devices, specifically at room temperature, where strong thermal fluctuations could further obscure the spin flow. Exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities being the quantum superposition of excitons and photons, are believed to be promising platforms for spin-dependent optoelectronic or, in short, spin-optronic devices. Long-range spin current flows of exciton polaritons may be controlled through the optical spin Hall effect. However, this effect could neither be unequivocally observed at room temperature nor be exploited for realistic polariton spintronic devices due to the presence of strong thermal fluctuations or large linear spin splittings. Here, we report the observation of room temperature optical spin Hall effect of exciton polaritons with the spin current flow over a distance as large as 60 um in a hybrid organic-inorganic FAPbBr3 perovskite microcavity. We show direct evidence of the long-range coherence at room temperature in the flow of exciton polaritons, and the spin current carried by them. By harnessing the long-range spin-Hall transport of exciton polaritons, we have demonstrated two novel room temperature polaritonic devices, namely the NOT gate and the spin-polarized beam splitter, advancing the frontier of room-temperature polaritonics in perovskite microcavities.

To optimize MTL performance on RubikONNs, two domain-specific physics-aware training algorithms \\textit{RotAgg} and \\textit{RotSeq} are proposed.
