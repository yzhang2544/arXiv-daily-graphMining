    "abstract": "           In recent years, several proposals that leverage principles from condensed matter and high-energy physics for engineering laser arrays have been put forward. The most important among these concepts are topology, which enables the construction of robust zero-mode laser devices, and supersymmetry (SUSY), which holds the potential for achieving phase locking in laser arrays. In this work, we show that the relation between supersymmetric coupled bosonic and fermionic oscillators on one side, and bipartite networks (and hence chiral symmetry) on another side can be exploited together with non-Hermitian engineering for building one- and two-dimensional laser arrays with in-phase synchronization. To demonstrate our strategy, we present a concrete design starting from the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model to arrive at a SUSY laser structure that enjoys two key advantages over those reported in previous works. Firstly, the design presented here features a near-uniform geometry for both the laser array and supersymmetric reservoir (i.e. the widths and distances between the cavity arrays are almost the same). Secondly, the uniform field distribution in the presented structure leads to a far-field intensity that scales as N^2 where N is the number of lasing elements. Taken together, these two features can enable the implementation of higher-power laser arrays that are easy to fabricate, and hence provide a roadmap for pushing the frontier of SUSY laser arrays beyond the proof-of-concept phase.

A novel circuit model design approach for this prototype is presented, and close agreement between the measured performance of the fabricated prototype and the simulation results validates this model.

Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.

As a pivotal component, TFLN-based electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) should exhibit low driving voltage, broad operation bandwidth, high extinction ration, and low insertion loss. However, the pursuit of both maximal EO overlap integral and minimal microwave loss necessitates a fundamental compromise between driving voltage and operational bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate high-performance TFLN EO MZMs constructed on a 12-{\\mu}m-thick silica buried layer using periodic capacitively loaded traveling-wave electrodes. In contrast to their counterparts utilizing undercut etched silicon substrates or quartz substrates, our devices exhibit streamlined fabrication processes and enhanced modulation efficiency. Notably, the fabricated MZMs attains a high modulation efficiency of 1.25 Vcm in the telecom C-band, while maintaining a low EO roll-off of 1.3 dB at 67 GHz. Our demonstration offers a pathway to achieving perfect group velocity matching and break the voltage-bandwidth limit in a simplified configuration suitable for volume fabrication, thereby laying foundational groundwork for the advancement of high-performance TFLN MZMs and benefiting the next-generation PICs in optical telecommunication, signal processing and other applications.

Our method employs 2D phase coding with 2-bit across a broad THz frequency range from 0.8 to 1.4 THz.

By optimizing structural parameters, this metasurface selectively resonates at characteristic absorption frequencies of target gases, facilitating detection even at low concentrations. We validate the approach using two gases with strong but distinct THz absorption profiles: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Furthermore, the free-standing design maximizes gas interaction on both sides of the metasurface, eliminating substrate-induced losses and enabling a reduced physical footprint. Our findings indicate that this metasurface outperforms standard THz sensing approaches in terms of compactness and sensitivity per path length unit, obtaining the same detection threshold as sensing in free space with a path length between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude shorter, underscoring its potential for industrial applications where the available space for sensing can be limited.

Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Fast and reliable manipulation with qubits is fundamental for any quantum technology. The implementation of these manipulations in physical systems is the focus of studies involving optimal control theory. Realistic physical devices are open quantum systems. So far, studies in optimal control theory have primarily utilized the Redfield/Lindblad quantum master equation to simulate the dynamics of such systems. However, this Markov description is not always sufficient. Here, we present a study of qubit control utilizing the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We compare the traditional master equation with more general Green's function results and demonstrate that even in the parameter regime suitable for the application of the Redfield/Lindblad approach, the two methods yield drastically different results when addressing evolution involving mixed states. In particular, we find that, in addition to predicting different optimal driving profiles, a more accurate description of system evolution enables the system to reach the desired final state much more quickly. We argue that the primary reason for this is the significance of the non-Markov description of driven system dynamics due to the effect of time-dependent driving on dissipation.         ",

    "abstract": "           The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nanostructured dielectric metasurfaces offer unprecedented opportunities to control light-matter momentum exchange, and thereby the forces and torques that light can exert on matter. Here we introduce optical metasurfaces as components of ultracompact untethered microscopic metaspinners capable of efficient light-induced rotation in a liquid environment. Illuminated by weakly focused light, a metaspinner generates torque via photon recoil through the metasurfaces ability to bend light towards high angles despite their sub-wavelength thickness, thereby creating orbital angular momentum. We find that a metaspinner is subject to an anomalous transverse lateral optical gradient force that acts in concert with the classical gradient force. Consequently, when two or more metaspinners are trapped together in a laser beam, they collectively orbit the optical axis in the opposite direction to their spinning motion, in stark contrast to rotors coupled through hydrodynamic or mechanical interactions. The metaspinners delineated herein not only serve to illustrate the vast possibilities of utilizing optical metasurfaces for fundamental exploration of optical torques, but they also represent potential building-blocks of artificial active matter systems, light-driven micromachinery, and general-purpose optomechanical devices.

The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.

The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education.

Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry, with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions.

Utilizing an imaging refractometer, we show a significant decrease in spatial autocorrelation of the laser field and the appearance of a laser speckle pattern shortly before stagnation. The intensity distribution of the speckles measured during different shot campaigns while employing long and short COBRA pulses follows the speckle statistics satisfactorily. The imaging refractometer signal is proportional to the integral over electron density gradients; hence, the measured phase randomization of the individual plane waves comprising the laser field implies random density distribution. To validate this, the Beam Propagation Method code simulates the laser beam propagation through different artificial density distributions with various average fluctuation scales and generates synthetic imaging refractometer data. The results reproduce similar trends in the experimental data, such as the increasing vertical width for the decreasing average spatial scale of the fluctuations and decreasing spatial correlation length of the laser field. Therefore, during the gas-puff z-pinch implosion process, it is likely that the plasma flow is almost always turbulent with the average spatial scale of the turbulent density fluctuations decreasing towards stagnation.

Through theoretical and computational analysis, we show that spatially resolving time-frequency correlation functions in the image plane can improve the imaging resolution by a factor of $\\sqrt2$ in most cases and up to twofold for strictly two emitters. This improvement is achieved by quantifying the degree of correlation in spectral fluctuations across the spatial domain. Experimentally, SFSR can be implemented using a combination of interferometry and photon-correlation measurements. The method works for non-blinking emitters and stochastic spectral fluctuations with arbitrary temporal statistics. This suggests its utility in super-resolution microscopy of quantum emitters at low temperatures, where spectral diffusion is often more pronounced than emitter blinking.         ",

By applying the present theory to the C--N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Further, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. Additionally, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuation.         ",

We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.         ",
