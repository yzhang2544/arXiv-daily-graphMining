    "abstract": "           This study investigates the probability of threading in star catenanes under good solvent conditions using molecular dynamics simulations, emphasizing the influence of ring rigidity. Threading in these systems arises from the interplay between the intrinsic topology of and within the star-shaped structure and the bending rigidity of individual rings. It is demonstrated that reduced ring flexibility enhances threading, and the presence of mechanical bonds is critical for threading formation. Notably, the bending rigidity of the rings alters their shapes, resulting in a non-monotonic threading probability with a peak at intermediate rigidity. Furthermore, increasing ring length is found to significantly boost threading probability. These findings elucidate the intricate relationships among topology and rigidity in governing threading, with implications for the design of advanced molecular systems and materials. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding threading in good solvent conditions, where such behavior is typically improbable for ring polymers, and opens avenues for the development of molecular machines and other complex architectures.

    "abstract": "           The ability to reconstruct high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurement is critical for many science and engineering applications, but remains a huge challenge. This challenge is caused by the large difference between the dimensions of the state space and the observational space, making the operator that provides the mapping from the state space to the observational space ill-conditioned and non-invertible. As a result, deriving the forward map from the observational space to the state space as the inverse of the measurement operator is nearly impossible. While traditional methods, including sparse optimization, data assimilation, or machine learning based regressive reconstruction, are available, they often struggle with generalization and computational efficiency, particularly when non-uniform or varying discretization of the domain are considered. In this work, we propose FLRONet, a novel operator learning framework designed to reconstruct full-state flow fields from sparse sensor measurements in space and time. FLRONet utilizes a branch-trunk architecture, where the branch network integrates sensor observations from multiple time instances, and the trunk network encodes the entire temporal domain. This design allows FLRONet to achieve highly accurate, discretization-independent reconstructions at any time within the observation window. Although the popular three-dimensional Fourier Neural Operator offers similar functionalities, our results show that FLRONet surpasses it in both accuracy and efficiency. FLRONet not only achieves superior performance in approximating the true operator but also exhibits significantly faster inference at high-fidelity discretizations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs) provide a path to solving many computationally hard problems more efficiently than deterministic algorithms on von Neumann computers. Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (S-MTJs), which are engineered to be thermally unstable, show promise as entropy sources in PIMs. However, scaling up S-MTJ-PIMs is challenging, as it requires fine control of a small magnetic energy barrier across large numbers of devices. In addition, non-spintronic components of S-MTJ-PIMs to date have been primarily realized using general-purpose processors or field-programmable gate arrays. Reaching the ultimate performance of spintronic PIMs, however, requires co-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), combining CMOS with spintronic entropy sources. Here we demonstrate an ASIC in 130 nm foundry CMOS, which implements integer factorization as a representative hard optimization problem, using PIM-based invertible logic gates realized with 1143 probabilistic bits. The ASIC uses stochastic bit sequences read from an adjacent voltage-controlled (V-) MTJ chip. The V-MTJs are designed to be thermally stable in the absence of voltage, and generate random bits on-demand in response to 10 ns pulses using the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect. We experimentally demonstrate the chip's functionality and provide projections for designs in advanced nodes, illustrating a path to millions of probabilistic bits on a single CMOS+V-MTJ chip.

We demonstrate the use of SHG on Si3N4 layers tested for their laser-induced damage threshold. The SHG mapping was compared with commonly used diagnostic techniques, including Nomarski microscopy, white light interferometry, and electron microscopy. Owing to its sensitivity to variations in local symmetry, SHG is able to discern minute alterations in material composition, mechanical stress, and interface structures. Therefore, SHG identified modifications in the tested layers, highly extending the damage recognized by standard methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SHG's ability to enhance specific features by modulation of incidence angles and polarization modes. Based on these findings, we propose SHG as an ideal diagnostic tool for the early identification of laser-induced modifications in centrosymmetric thin films.         ",

In PNNs, weights are photonic devices that make them susceptible to environmental factors and fabrication variations. These vulnerabilities can result in inaccurate parameter mapping, increased tuning power consumption, and reduced network performance when conventional offline training methods are used. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an online training and pruning method to address these challenges. By incorporating a power-related term into the conventional loss function, our approach minimizes the inference power budget. With this method, PNNs achieve 96% accuracy while reducing the power consumption by almost 45% on the Iris dataset, despite fabrication and thermal variations. Furthermore, our method is validated with a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) experiment for radio-frequency (RF) fingerprinting applications and simulations across larger CNNs on image classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Subwavelength photonic structures and metamaterials provide revolutionary approaches for controlling light. The inverse design methods proposed for these subwavelength structures are vital to the development of new photonic devices. However, most of the existing inverse design methods cannot realize direct mapping from optical properties to photonic structures but instead rely on forward simulation methods to perform iterative optimization. In this work, we exploit the powerful generative abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and propose a practical inverse design method based on latent diffusion models. Our method maps directly the optical properties to structures without the requirement of forward simulation and iterative optimization. Here, the given optical properties can work as \"prompts\" and guide the constructed model to correctly \"draw\" the required photonic structures. Experiments show that our direct mapping-based inverse design method can generate subwavelength photonic structures at high fidelity while following the given optical properties. This may change the method used for optical design and greatly accelerate the research on new photonic devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.

    "abstract": "           Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.

However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.         ",

Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.

The LPTs make the interpretation of these experiments more challenging. The LPTs preserve the short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid by collective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and heating, with minimal change in the ion-ion pair-distribution functions, and in transport properties such as the electrical and thermal conductivities $\\sigma$ and $\\kappa$.

However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement based methods can produce high quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement based methods, while still producing states with high-fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.         ",

The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity.
