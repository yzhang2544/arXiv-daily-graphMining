    "abstract": "           Silicon G centers show significant promise as single photon sources in a scalable silicon platform. But these color centers have large non-radiative decay and a low Debye-Waller factor, limiting their usability in quantum applications. In this work, we demonstrate bright Purcell-enhanced emission from a silicon G center by coupling it to a nanophotonic cavity. The nanobeam cavity enhances the spontaneous emission rate of a single G center by a factor of 6, corresponding to a Purcell factor greater than 31 when accounting for decay into the phonon sideband. We obtain a spontaneous emission rate of 0.97 ns, which is the fastest single photon emission rate reported in silicon. With this radiative enhancement, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in emitter brightness compared to previously reported values. These results pave the way for scalable quantum light sources on a silicon photonic chip.         ",

However, current XFELs are large, expensive, and exhibit significant shot-to-shot instability. Here, we propose a novel compact apparatus for generating X-ray lasers. The setup integrates an ion source to produce highly charged ions as the gain medium. The X-ray optical cavity employs crystal Bragg diffraction for high reflectivity at large angles, and two parabolic compound refractive lenses (CRLs) focus the X-rays. Pumping is achieved through electron collision excitations. This X-ray laser offers compact dimensions, reduced costs, and enhanced coherence, positioning it as a promising seed for XFELs. With further optimization, this device has the potential to rival XFELs and revolutionize both scientific research and industrial applications.         ",

Electrostatic coupling between the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric semiconducting channels results in hysteretic transfer and output characteristics of both FETs.

Further, simultaneous measurements of the MoS$_2$ and In$_2$Se$_3$ transistor synapses help realize complex heterosynaptic cooperation and competition behaviors. These are shown to mimic advanced sensorimotor neural network-controlled gill withdrawal reflex sensitization and habituation of a sea mollusk (Aplysia) with ultra-low power consumption.

One of the simplest ways to describe their evaporation is the D$^2$-Law. It states that the evaporation rate is proportional to $t^{-1/2}$, and $R^{-1}$. However, models like the D$^2$-Law do not account for the volumetric heating of light and the effect of strong irradiation on individual droplets is not fully understood. Here we show the effects of IR irradiation on optically levitated water droplets. We find that, under strong irradiation of up to $10^8 W/m^2$, the droplet evaporation is initially driven by the heat from the laser following the power law $dR / dt \\sim R$, i.e. the inverse of the D$^2$-Law. Then, when the droplets shrink to 2 - 3 $\\mu$m in radius a turnover occurs from irradiation-driven back to diffusion-driven evaporation. Our findings support the understanding of droplet evaporation in cases such as rocket engines or internal combustion, where the radiation from the flame will heat water and fuel droplets.         ",

    "abstract": "           A new mechanism of enhanced laser energy absorption in plasma microglobules is demonstrated with the help of two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. The mechanism relies on the excitation of surface and bulk waves and the occurrence of repeated collisions in the confines of the finite-sized microglobular target. The episodic increase in the average particle energy correlates with the repeated collision of the surface and bulk waves that get excited by the laser on the target. It is shown that the size of the microglobular target governs the efficiency of absorption and the timings of episodic events of energy enhancement. This study thereby illustrates the novel efficient possibility that a closed plasma target provides for energy extraction. Parallels of such colliding waves creating havoc in terms of wave breaking etc. can be witnessed on the ocean surface, seismic disturbances traversing as body waves traverse reflecting and refracting in the interior of the Earth along with surface waves (propagating on the curved surface of the Earth) converge at the antipode to create destruction. Our studies here show the importance of choosing closed targets which aid in the process of repeated energy transfer to particles and often their thermalization. The waves keep propagating in the closed confines rather than getting dissipated over an extended region as would happen for extended targets.         ",

Achieving efficient nonlinear frequency conversion in optical microresonators is paramount to fully unlocking this potential, yet the absolute conversion efficiency (ACE) of many processes, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), remains fundamentally constrained by dissipative losses and intrinsic nonlinear effects in the device. In this work, we establish a unified theoretical framework for SHG in microresonators, identifying a decisive factor M that predicts the upper limit of ACE under the nonlinear critical coupling (NCC) condition. Using this framework, we fabricate integrated periodically poled lithium niobate microresonators and address the dispersive and dissipative suppression to approach the NCC condition. We achieve a record-high experimental ACE of 61.3% with milliwatt-level pump powers toward the ultimate efficiency, with the potential for even higher efficiency as the M factor increases.

The change in the twist angle strongly influences the resonant frequencies and available propagating diffraction orders with applications including sensing, lasing, slow light or wavefront engineering. In this work, we design and analyze twisted bilayer crystals capable of steering light in a direction controlled by the twist angle. In order to achieve beam steering, the device efficiently routes input power into a single, twist-dependent, transmitted diffraction order. The outgoing light then follows the orientation of this diffraction order, externally controlled by the twist angle. The optimization is performed using high-efficiency heuristic optimization method which enabled a data-oriented approach to further understand the design operation. The optimized device demonstrates an efficiency above 90% across twist angles ranging from 0 to 30 degrees for both TE and TM polarizations. Extending the optimization to include left- and right-handed polarizations yields overall accuracy nearing 90% when averaged across the entire 0 to 60 degrees control range. Finally, we show how the device resembles blazed gratings by effectively canceling the undesired diffraction orders. The optimized devices exhibit a shared slant dependent on the selected diffraction order. Our analysis is supported by a structural blazing model arising from the data-oriented statistical analysis.         ",

This approach is enabled by deep learning-driven diffractive optical design with wafer-scale nano-fabrication using high-purity fused silica to ensure optical transparency and thermal stability. Our design achieves unidirectional imaging across three visible wavelengths (covering red, green and blue parts of the spectrum), and we experimentally validated this broadband unidirectional imager by creating high-fidelity images in the forward direction and generating weak, distorted output patterns in the backward direction, in alignment with our numerical simulations. This work demonstrates the wafer-scale production of diffractive optical processors, featuring 16 levels of nanoscale phase features distributed across two axially aligned diffractive layers for visible unidirectional imaging. This approach facilitates mass-scale production of ~0.5 billion nanoscale phase features per wafer, supporting high-throughput manufacturing of hundreds to thousands of multi-layer diffractive processors suitable for large apertures and parallel processing of multiple tasks. Our design can seamlessly integrate into conventional optical systems, broadening its applicability in fields such as security, defense, and telecommunication. Beyond broadband unidirectional imaging in the visible spectrum, this study establishes a pathway for artificial-intelligence-enabled diffractive optics with versatile applications, signaling a new era in optical device functionality with industrial-level massively scalable fabrication.

The high brittleness of high silicon steel makes its production and processing very difficult. For more than 30 years, many steel companies and research institutions around the world have adopted various technical means to study the industrialization of high silicon steel, but they have not been successful . JFE-NKK steel company in Japan has realized the small batch production of high silicon steel by using SiCl4-CVD technology.

The process is simple and easy without any corrosion or pollution, which may provide a new way for the world to achieve large-scale production of high silicon steel.

The cooling laser beams comprised the incident, retroreflected, and four diagonally diffracted beams at an angle of 50\u00b0. The intensity of the retroreflected beam was carefully adjusted to balance the radiation forces acting on the atoms. Despite the challenges posed by cesium atoms with high nuclear spin, a significant number of cold atoms ($7.0 {\\times} 10^6$) were captured when the detuning and power of the incident beam were -10 MHz and 131 mW, respectively, with the intensity of the retroreflected beam set to 69 % of that of the incident beam. The importance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process was highlighted when the intensity ratio was reduced to 24 %, resulting in the absence of trapped atoms. This underscores the significance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping process. Notably, the distribution of the cold atom cloud differed from other magneto-optical traps, as it was not centered in the region where the cooling beams overlapped. Instead, numerous cold atoms were observed when the cloud was positioned near the apex closer to the grating side and an edge line of the overlapping region. Therefore, trapping can be achieved with the assistance of attractive dipole forces exerted by the diffracted beams, which exhibits high intensities at these positions.         ",

We report a Brillouin gain coefficient of 129.5 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$ and further demonstrate the Brillouin frequency tuning through variations in either pump frequency or chip operating temperature. Based on the suspended TFLN nanowaveguide, by optimizing the confinement of both photonic and phononic modes, we have achieved a Brillouin amplifier with a record-high gain of 8.5 dB. This result not only validates the feasibility of strong guided Brillouin interaction using suspended TFLN nanowaveguides, but also paves the way for novel on-chip sensing and signal processing applications.

We investigate how the parameters used to burn the spectral hole impact its shape, and how these factors determine the minimum achievable linewidth. In addition to the stability of the hole's center frequency, the linewidth and contrast play a crucial role in frequency locking. At sub-kelvin temperatures, the temperaturedependent T^7 broadening from two-phonon Raman scattering is expected to be negligible, and the spectral hole's linewidth should therefore remain constant in this interval. We observe however a linear broadening with increasing temperature, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms governing the linewidth at ultra-low temperatures.         ",

A photonic quantum heat engine (QHE) composed of two optical cavities can be modeled as coupled harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. Photons in the cavities become entangled during the engine operation. We show that the work done by such an engine is maximum if at the end of the cycle the oscillators swap numbers of excitations which can be achieved when the engine operates under the condition of parametric resonance.

This can be proven by demonstrating that, once the theory's laws are imposed, what is happening within a region fixes what will happen in the contracting light-cone with that region as its base. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be applied to quantum field theory (without collapse), examining two different ways of assigning reduced density matrix states to regions of space. Our preferred method begins from field wave functionals and judges quantum field theory to be local. Another method begins from particle wave functions (states in Fock space) and leads to either non-locality or an inability to assign states to regions, depending on the choice of creation operators. We take this analysis of quantum field theory (without collapse) to show that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is local at the fundamental level. We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local or global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an objection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born Rule from self-locating uncertainty.

Coupling atoms with an optical cavity in the Purcell regime substantially enhances the two-photon scattering.

The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure effectively captures the relevant dynamical frequencies in the time evolution and is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics. We showcase the method's effectiveness by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D. By extracting the asymptotic long-time evolution, we uncover signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, the method presented here shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches and highlight the potential to explore previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.

Such high-spin molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study many-body physics and fundamental models in quantum magnetism. Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings leading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT), a PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving a direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice coupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning probe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with majority-majority and minority-minority couplings. We expect our proof-of-principle study to provide impetus for the design of purely organic ferromagnetic materials.         ",

Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize two diffractive collection elements operating at $\\lambda=397$ nm; a forward emitting design is predicted to offer 0.25% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode, while a more efficient reverse-emitting design offers $1.14\\%$ collection efficiency, albeit with more demanding fabrication requirements.

Although our understanding of wave phenomena has come a long way since the earliest observations of desert dunes or ocean waves, the unimpeded development of mathematics has enabled ever more complex and exotic physical phenomena to be comprehensively described. Here, we take wave manipulation a step further by introducing an unprecedented synthetic acoustic crystal capable of realizing simultaneous linear broadband conduction and nonlinear topological insulation, depicting a robust amplitude-dependent mode localized deep within - i.e. an amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound. The latter is achieved by means of an open acoustic waveguide lined with a chain of nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled active electroacoustic resonators. Starting from a comprehensive topological model for classical waves, we demonstrate that different topological regimes can be accessed by increasing driving amplitude and that topological robustness against coupling disorder is a direct consequence of symmetric and simultaneous response between coupled resonators. Theoretical predictions are validated by a fully programmable experimental apparatus capable of realizing the real-time manipulation of metacrystal properties. In all, our results provide a solid foundation for future research in the design and manipulation of classical waves in artificial materials involving nonlinearity, nonlocality, and non-hermiticity.

However, the high velocities of these lightweight atoms complicate precision spectroscopy, particularly in the 1S-2S transition, due to transit time broadening and second-order Doppler shifts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method combining two-photon Ramsey spectroscopy with a technique to correct the second-order Doppler shifts on an atom-by-atom basis. Additionally, this approach suppresses systematic effects of the AC Stark shift to a negligible level compared to the target precision. Simulations predict that for both positronium and muonium, this method could improve the measurement precision of the 1S-2S transition by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. This approach opens up new avenues for rigorous bound-state QED tests and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.         ",

    "abstract": "           We study the silicon vacancy in 3C SiC as a color center of interest in the field of Quantum Technologies, focusing on its magnetic interaction with the SiC nuclear spin bath containing Si29 and C13 nuclei in their natural isotopic concentration. We calculate the system energetic and magnetic properties with ab initio methods based on the Density Functional Theory, identifying the neutral charge state of the silicon vacancy as the most favorable for p doped 3C SiC systems. We thereon evaluate the Free Induction Decay and the Hahn echo sequence on the electron spin interacting with the nuclear spin bath. Here, the Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation phenomenon, due to single nuclear spin flipping processes, and the overall decay are highlighted in the context of the Cluster Correlation Expansion theory. We find a non exponential coherence decay, which is a typical feature of solid state qubits subjected to low frequency 1/f noise from the environment.         ",

    "abstract": "           Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.

    "abstract": "           We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \\approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.         ",

The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.         ",

    "abstract": "           Many quantum systems exhibit high sensitivity to their initial conditions, where microscopic quantum fluctuations can significantly influence macroscopic observables. Understanding how quantum states may influence the behavior of nonlinear dynamic systems may open new avenues in controlling light-matter interactions. To explore this issue, we analyze the sensitivity of a fundamental quantum optical process - parametric oscillation - to quantum initializations. Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the \"quantum sensitivity\" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits. Our work opens the way to a new class of experiments that can test the sensitivity of macroscopic systems to quantum initial conditions and offers a pathway for controlling systems with quantum degrees of freedom.
