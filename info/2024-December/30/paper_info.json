Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.         ",

We find that some electrons in the wall are pulled into the channel by the transverse electric field and are directly accelerated. Meanwhile, they move steadily along the conical wall via laser pondermotive force. The results show that the focusing effect of the curved wall conical channel is stronger than that of the traditional flat wall conical channel, and the density of the attosecond electron bunches is increased by nearly 175% as well as the maximum energy is increased by 36%. We also find that the quality of the electron bunches is affected by the geometry of the concial channel wall. Interestingly it is found that the attosecond electron bunches obtained from the specific concial channel with the hyperbolic geometry of the curved wall can keep stable around the maximum electron energy within 10T0 even if they have left the channel.

    "abstract": "           Parkinsons disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinsons, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA and chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinsons disease tissues and cells when compared to normal tissues and cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA and chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA and chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.

However, current wavelength-tunable devices often rely on tuning mechanisms or device architectures that lead to slow modulation or bulky setups. In this study, we overcome limitations on speed and size by demonstrating a compact tunable microlaser embedding electrical microheaters beneath a perovskite metasurface. This architecture allows to efficiently deliver heat and rapidly modulate the phase transition. Our device leverages the optical gain and crystallographic phase tuning of the perovskite, and a high-quality factor cavity design based on bound states in the continuum. With it, we demonstrate reversible laser wavelength switching between 763 nm and 783 nm within 13 ms at 2.3 V. This work unlocks the potential of perovskite metasurfaces for electrically tunable light sources and introduces a flexible platform which can be easily extended to the dynamic control of polarization or directionality for optical communication, sensing and spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "           Laser-based displays are highly sought after for their superior brightness and color performance, especially in advanced applications like augmented reality (AR). However, their broader adoption has been hindered by bulky projector designs and complex optical module assemblies. Here, we introduce a new laser display architecture enabled by large-scale visible photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to address these challenges. Unlike previous projector-style laser displays, this architecture features an ultra-thin, flat-panel form factor, replacing bulky free-space illumination modules with a single, high-performance photonic chip. Centimeter-scale PIC devices, which integrate thousands of distinct optical components on-chip, are carefully tailored to achieve high display uniformity, contrast, and efficiency. We demonstrate a 2 mm-thick flat-panel laser display combining the PIC with a liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) panel, achieving 211% of the color gamut and more than 80% volume reduction compared to traditional LCoS displays. We further showcase its application in a see-through AR system. Our work represents a major advancement in the integration of nanophotonics with display technology, enabling a range of new display concepts, from high-performance immersive displays to slim-panel 3D holography.

In this work, we present a Black Phosphorus/Graphitic Carbon Nitride (BP/g-CN) heterostructure engineered to leverage phosphorus-nitrogen interactions for enhanced electrochemical glucose oxidation activity. Compared to pristine gCN, the BP-gCN heterostructure demonstrates a significantly improved electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and nearly two-fold reduction in charge transfer resistance (Rct), achieving remarkable glucose sensitivity of 1.1 uA mM(^-1) cm(^-2) at physiological pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed stronger glucose adsorption and higher charge transfer on the BP-gCN heterostructure compared to pristine gCN surface. These theoretical insights complement the experimental findings, highlighting the superior electrocatalytic performance of the heterostructure and the role of oxidized BP surface. Furthermore, the BP-gCN sensor is integrated into a wearable device platform with microfluidic layers and a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip, forming a conformal skin patch that enables real-time sweat glucose monitoring. This demonstration of a high-performance, non-enzymatic wearable glucose sensor based on a heterostructure design underscores the potential of the device for seamless health management and paves the way for next generation biosensing platforms aimed at improving personalized and continuous health monitoring.

We show that the non-adiabatic response of electrons occurs on a sub-femtosecond time scale interval localized near the peaks of the driving laser electric field. It allows us to obtain an effective Hamiltonian which describes weak interaction of electrons with atto-second pulse train with the second harmonic of the drive laser frequency being the repetition frequency in the train. Electron-hole pairs with energies above-threshold are born in coherent super-position of states by resonant absorption of UV photons and subsequently produce rapidly oscillating electric dipole moment. The dipole radiation emitted during each half-cycle of the laser pulse is characterized by broad continuous spectrum with well-defined cutoff. High-order harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency emerge on top of the continuous background via interference in time of emissions from all half-cycles within the pulse duration. We also discuss the relevance of the pulse envelope for producing clean frequency combs as observed in experiments. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized at right angles to the optical axis of the crystal.

The signal from the cavity is too weak to be acquired by a signal receiver. The amplification chain assists the signal acquisition by amplifying the signal and requires accurate gain calibration. Typically, the readout line is calibrated using the Y-factor method, involving a switch that directs either the detection line or the calibration line to the amplification chain. The detection and calibration lines may have different transmissions, which leads to the calibration results being less accurate. In response, we propose a calibration method that eliminates the need for a switch. In this approach, the cavity temperature is decoupled to its incoming noise source and can be controlled, resulting in excess or deficiency of the noise spectrum near its resonance frequency. The experimental result shows that the gain of the amplification chain can be calibrated directly using the temperature-varied cavity radiation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.

This work exhibits the feasibility of achieving this goal using bichromatic optical fields, which allow for the precise control of sub-cycle electron dynamics. The combined effect of the helical and asymmetric waveforms of the optical fields leads to highly asymmetric excitation at different valleys and displacement of the excited electrons concurrently, thereby inducing valley-polarized currents with high valley purity, on the sub-optical-cycle timescale. Inherently, the purity of the currents built up from the optical approach remains high even for materials with short decoherence time. Moreover, the direction of the currents can be precisely controlled by adjusting the relative phase of the bichromatic components. Our work offers a promising avenue for generating and modulating high-purity valley-polarized currents at the femtosecond timescale, facilitating the development of petahertz valleytronics.

    "abstract": "           We explore Majorana stellar representation on the Riemann sphere for optical scalar beams and vector fields, leveraging the spin and orbital angular momentum of light. For scalar beams, the star constellations for the Laguerre-Gaussian beam basis reside at the poles of the sphere. For vector fields, these constellations represent well-defined circular polarization. The underlying $su(2)$ symmetry of angular momenta enables populating the sphere through generalized unitary rotations of the basis elements, resulting in optical analogues of Bloch and generalized $su(2)$ coherent states for both scalar beams and vector fields. Constellations for scalar Hermite-Gaussian beams and vector Hermite-Gaussian partial Poincar\u00e9 fields, restricted to linear polarization, occupy the equator of the sphere as a result of these rotations. Additionally, we investigate scalar and vector analogues of cat codes and kings of quantumness, providing insights into the visualization and characterization of complex optical beams and fields with potential applications in optical communications.

    "abstract": "           A quasi-unidimensional one-electron double quantum dot is studied within the framework of Shannon informational entropy. Its confinement potential, which is described by an asymmetric harmonic-gaussian function, consists of two wells separated by a potential barrier, and the asymmetry of the potential in respect to the center of the barrier is parameterized by $x_0$. In this work we employ Shannon informational entropy as a tool to investigate changes in the electronic confinement resulting from the modifications in the degree of asymmetry $x_0$. In particular, we notice that Shannon entropy turns out to be very sensitive to the change from the symmetric to the antisymmetric regime. Moreover, we show that Shannon entropy as a function of $x_0$ for an electronic excited state displays an irregular behavior whenever the state energy is in the vicinity of a local extreme (a maximum or a minimum); connected with this we observe an oscillatory behavior of the energy of the excited states as a function of $x_0$.

To reveal charge and spin redistribution during these reactions the CAS(4,4) wave functions were analyzed using the orthogonal valence bond method (OVB). The potential energy curves, different internal coordinates, and the results of the OVB analysis show, that frequently the addition and elimination reactions follow different minimum energy paths, because they are indeed diabatic reactions. In these cases, there are no energy barriers corresponding to saddle points on the potential energy surfaces but the energy increases during one diabatic reaction until, at a certain point, the system jumps to the other diabatic state and, in the following, the energy decreases. This happens for reactions in $C_{2v}$ symmetry; as soon as the system can change to the lower symmetry, the diabatic states combine to an adiabatic one and the reaction follows a single minimum energy path.

The toolbox has graphical output and $\\chi^{2}$ statistics, as well as weighted, projected, or forward-backward equations. It can generate input-output quantum spectra. The equations can have independent periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann or Robin boundary conditions in any dimension, for any vector component, and at either end of any interval. xSPDE has functions that can numerically solve both ordinary and partial differential stochastic equations of any type, obtaining correlations, probabilities and averages. The toolbox has a core treating stochastic differential equations, with averages, probability distributions and full error estimates. There are stochastic extensions treating applications to partial differential equations, projected equations, quantum stochastic equations, master equations and quantum phase-space simulations including Gaussian boson sampling experiments.

    "abstract": "           Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the state dimension minus one, and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the state dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.

Threeway and nonlocal two-way entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context.

We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the {\\pi}-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle.

    "abstract": "           Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \\textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \\textit{bcc}-\\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \\textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \\textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.
