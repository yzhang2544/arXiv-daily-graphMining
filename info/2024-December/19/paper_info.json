    "abstract": "           In this work, we address the challenges posed by the high nonlinearity of the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation in forward and inverse simulations of the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework. The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \\( j \\) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \\( \\psi \\) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.         ",

Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both the tension and elastic modulus of lens tissue and capsule.

Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. Young's modulus (E) was 1.9 MPa for anterior capsules and 1.2 MPa for posterior capsules. Tensions in cortical tissue (E ~ 10 kPa) were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension from near zero to 64 kPa. This acousto-optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.         ",

In the presented experiment, we demonstrated unidirectional Raman emission of Stokes photons from 87Rb atoms in a ring cavity. A bias magnetic field B0 is applied along z-direction on the atoms to define the quantum axis, which breaks the time inverse symmetry. By transversely applying write laser pulses to drive a \\pi-transition of the atoms, we generate spontaneous Raman emissions of Stokes photons from a chiral (\\sigma+) transition. The emissions are coupled into the clock-wise (z-direction) and counter-clock-wise (-z-direction) modes of a running-wave cavity, respectively. According to the mirror (parity) symmetry of the atom-light coupling, we demonstrated that spins (polarizations) of the Stokes fields are correlated with their propagation directions along z and -z -axis. The Stokes emissions constrained to the spin-momentum correlation are found to be violation of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. Based on the correlation, we demonstrated that the Stokes emissions propagate along the clock-wise or counter-clock-wise via polarization dissipation. The directional factor is up to 1500:1.

    "abstract": "           To effectively apply passive speckle reduction methods, it is essential to use an illumination system that maximally exploits the non-ideal temporal coherence and angular diversity (spatial coherence reduction) of laser light. This study examines the necessary conditions for these factors to act independently to achieve maximum speckle reduction. A novel design for decoherent focusing of laser illumination into a rectangular, uniformly lit spot is proposed. The design is based on an array of rectangular prisms of varying heights and a Fresnel lens comprising crossed 1D cylindrical Fresnel lenses with flat facets. Mathematical modelling demonstrates that such a lens can effectively focus a Gaussian beam into a rectangular uniform illuminated spot, even for lenses with a high numerical aperture (NA = 0.2). A planar implementation of this lens is also proposed. The comb-like spectrum of a laser diode is shown to limit the capabilities of passive methods, as it is challenging to generate a significant number of decorrelated laser sub-beams beyond the available spectral modes. Experimental results confirm that applying a slight modulation (~15%) to the laser diode current during intensity integration transforms the comb spectrum into a continuous one. This enables the generation of an unlimited number of decorrelated laser beams, independent of the laser's spectral modes, to achieve the desired number for a specific optical device.         ",

This research addresses that gap by evaluating LLD-induced attenuation and optimizing OPB design for efficient power delivery over long distances. A combined theoretical and simulation-based approach is employed, utilizing the T-matrix method to model LLD attenuation and Gaussian beam theory to optimize transmission and receiver parameters. The results indicate that LLD significantly attenuates ground-to-ground optical power transmission in illuminated regions, thus making OPB more suitable in darker areas, such as permanently shadowed regions or during the lunar night. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OPB can operate over long distances on the Moon while maintaining reasonable aperture sizes through appropriate optical design optimizations. These findings highlight the potential of OPB as a reliable power solution for sustainable lunar exploration and habitation.         ",

Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory.

Quantum mechanics is generally constrained by the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite observations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating that in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal equation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation window. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes substantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that only with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in a well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is warped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique solution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions. Our framework bridges seemingly disparate concepts such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, decoherence, and measurement within intrinsic quantum mechanics even without invoking new theory.

In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.

    "abstract": "           Fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing requires the generation of large entangled resource states. The required size of these states makes it challenging to simulate the effects of errors such as loss and partial distinguishability. For an interferometer with $N$ partially distinguishable input photons and $M$ spatial modes, the Fock basis can have up to ${N+NM-1\\choose N}$ elements. We show that it is possible to use a much smaller unsymmetrized basis with size $M^N$ without discarding any information. This enables simulations of the joint effect of loss and partial distinguishability on larger states than is otherwise possible. We demonstrate the technique by providing the first-ever simulations of the generation of imperfect qubits encoded using quantum parity codes, including an example where the Hilbert space is over $60$ orders of magnitude smaller than the $N$-photon Fock space. As part of the analysis, we derive the loss mechanism for partially distinguishable photons.         ",

Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using picosecond terahertz (THz) source pulses, focused onto the picocavity of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using THz pump--THz probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a signature of charge transport via quantized defect states. We identify back tunneling of localized charges to the tip electrode as a key challenge for lightwave-driven STM when probing electronic states with charge-state lifetimes exceeding the pulse duration. However, we show that back tunneling can be mitigated by the Franck-Condon blockade, which limits accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport. Our rate equation model accurately reproduces the time-dependent tunneling process across the different coupling regimes. This work builds on recent progress in imaging coherent lattice and quasiparticle dynamics with lightwave-driven STM and opens new avenues for exploring ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials, advancing the development of lightwave-driven nanoscale electronics.

This type of structures has been utilized in the design of various bio-inspired composite materials. Such applications often require the materials to exhibit a specified nonlinear stress-strain relationship. A key challenge lies in identifying appropriate interface properties from an infinite search space to achieve a given target stress-strain curve. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework specifically tailored for the inverse design of interfaces in bio-inspired composites. As a notable advantage, this method is capable of expanding the design space, allowing the discovery of optimal solutions even when the target curve deviates significantly from the initial dataset. Furthermore, our results show that BO can identify distinct interface designs that produce similar target stress-strain responses, yet differ in their deformation and failure mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed BO framework to address a wide range of inverse design challenges in nonlinear mechanics problems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.

    "abstract": "           Next-generation heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) relies on fast, localized heating of the magnetic medium during the write process. Au plasmonic near-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but increased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term reliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta capping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR and other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is investigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are extensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective capping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate dewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be highly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers of Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact capping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective against dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them apart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics considerations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more effectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides some convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer, for a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.         ",

We consider two-port linear circuits with mostly holonomic constraints provided by either Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current rules or Maxwell-Kirchhoff's voltage rules. The circuit's independent variables, generally a superset of the degrees of freedom, are obtained from the solution space of Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current or voltage rules. The method does not require to find any Lagrangian. Instead, the circuit's classical or quantum Hamiltonian is obtained from the energy of the reactive (i.e., conservative) circuit elements by means of transformations complementary to Hamilton's equations. Dissipation (loss) is accounted for by using the Rayleigh dissipation function and defining generalized Poisson brackets--Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. Fluctuations (noise) are added as voltage or current sources characterized by bath modes. Non-conservative elements (e.g., noisy resistors) are included ab initio using the incidence-matrix method, without needing to treat them as separate elements. Finally, we show that in order to form a complete set of canonical coordinates, auxiliary (which could be parasitic in certain cases) circuit elements are required to find the Hamiltonian of circuits with an incomplete set of generalized velocities. In particular, we introduce two methods to eliminate the coordinates associated with the auxiliary elements by either Hamiltonian reduction or equation-of-motion reduction. We use auxiliary circuit elements to treat a maximally nonlinear circuit comprising simultaneously both a Josephson junction and a quantum phase slip.         ",
