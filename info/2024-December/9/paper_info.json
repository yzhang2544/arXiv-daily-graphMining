    "title": "Advancing Marine Heatwave Forecasts: An Integrated Deep Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "           Marine heatwaves (MHWs), an extreme climate phenomenon, pose significant challenges to marine ecosystems and industries, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate change. This study introduces an integrated deep learning approach to forecast short-to-long-term MHWs on a global scale. The approach combines graph representation for modeling spatial properties in climate data, imbalanced regression to handle skewed data distributions, and temporal diffusion to enhance forecast accuracy across various lead times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that synthesizes three spatiotemporal anomaly methodologies to predict MHWs. Additionally, we introduce a method for constructing graphs that avoids isolated nodes and provide a new publicly available sea surface temperature anomaly graph dataset. We examine the trade-offs in the selection of loss functions and evaluation metrics for MHWs. We analyze spatial patterns in global MHW predictability by focusing on historical hotspots, and our approach demonstrates better performance compared to traditional numerical models in regions such as the middle south Pacific, equatorial Atlantic near Africa, south Atlantic, and high-latitude Indian Ocean. We highlight the potential of temporal diffusion to replace the conventional sliding window approach for long-term forecasts, achieving improved prediction up to six months in advance. These insights not only establish benchmarks for machine learning applications in MHW forecasting but also enhance understanding of general climate forecasting methodologies.         ",

We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.

These chiral dissipative solitons, which we term polarization faticons, break both temporal and polarization symmetry and consist of two bright lobes of opposite polarization handedness, interlocked by a domain wall. Our study reveals that faticons are connected to a vectorial modulational instability, from which they can be excited through a collapsing dynamic. Faticons could offer a novel pathway for frequency comb generation in normal dispersion resonators. More generally, they offer new fundamental insights into vectorial localized dissipative structures and could be relevant to other multi-component dissipative systems.         ",

The metasurface-based approach has realized significant advancements in vortex production, utilizing either dynamic or geometric phases. The dynamic design exhibits indifference to the polarization state of incident light, while the geometric design is inextricably tied to it. In the study, we put forth the proposition that combining dynamic and geometric phases could unlock the potential of metasurface design in generating optical vortices. A hybrid design that harnesses the combined dynamic and geometric phases can attain the same objective while offering tunable functional control over the polarization of light. We establish a correlation between the structural parameters of metasurface and the topological charge of the resulting vortices. The experimental results fully demonstrate the design's flexibility and its effective control over the polarization constraints of incident light. Our research uncovers the capacity for vortex generation through the manipulation of hybrid phases introduced by metasurfaces, indicating significant potential for the design of optical devices and the future advancement of innovative optical applications.

Phys. 160, 064113 (2024)), for employing machine-learning techniques to simulate the quantum dynamics of electrons. In particular, we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) simulation in the gauge of the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) for training the MPT equation of motion. Spatially-localized time-dependent MLWFs provide a concise representation that is particularly convenient for the MPT expressed in terms of increasing orders of moments. The equation of motion for these moments can be integrated in time while the analytical expressions are quite involved. In this work, machine-learning techniques were used to train the the second-order time derivatives of the moments using first-principles data from the RT-TDDFT simulation, and this MPT enabled us to perform electron dynamics efficiently. The application to computing optical absorption spectrum for various systems was demonstrated as a proof-of-principles example of this approach. In addition to isolated molecules (water, benzene, and ethene), condensed matter systems (liquid water and crystalline silicon) were studied, and we also explored how the principle of the nearsightedness of electrons can be employed in this context.

However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.         ",

    "abstract": "           Laser-driven electron transport across a sample has garnered enormous attentions over several decades, as it provides a much faster way to control electron dynamics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, so how and why an electron can acquire a longitudinal velocity remains unanswered. Here we show that it is the magnetic field that steers the electron to the light propagation direction. But, quantitatively, our free-electron model is still unable to reproduce the experimental velocities. Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the system absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the experimental observation. We introduce a concept of the resistive transport, where electrons deaccelerate under a constant resistance after laser excitation. This theory finally explains why the experimental distance-versus-time forms a down-concave curve, and unifies ballistic and superdiffusive transports into a single resistive transport. We expect that our finding will motivate further investigations.         ",

This approach enables the implementation of arbitrary noise operations on single-polarization qubits using a minimal set of three liquid-crystal metasurfaces, whose transverse distribution of the optic axes can be patterned to reproduce the target process.

The underlying mechanism is elucidated by the theoretical calculations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials.

For widespread industrial adoption, however, these sensors need a design that is as simple and cost-effective as possible.

Recently, a modified approach was introduced, which involves splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining temperature based on the ratio of the two resulting signals. In this analysis, we provide a detailed comparison of both methods. At room temperature, the two methods show comparable performance, with slight variations depending on component quality. However, at temperatures around 300 \u00b0C, the new method's performance is estimated to be nearly twice that of the original, provided optimal filter parameters are used. Additionally, the sensitivity of the new method remains roughly consistent with its performance at room temperature.         ",
