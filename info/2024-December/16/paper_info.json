    "title": "Charge management system based on disturbance observer sliding mode control for space inertial sensors",
    "abstract": "           Precision space inertial sensors are imperative for Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations, and fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, free-falling test masses(TMs) are susceptible to parasitic electrostatic forces and torques, with significant contributions from the interaction between stray electric fields and TM charge. These effects can make up a sizable fraction of the noise budget. Thus, a charge management system(CMS) is essential in high-precise space-based missions. However, the operating environment for space charge control is full of uncertainties and disturbances. TM charge tracking precision is negatively affected by many physical parameters such as external charging rate, quantum yield, UV light power, etc. Those parameters are rarely measured and supposed to vary because of changes in solar activity, temperature, aging of electronic components and so on. The unpredictability and variability of these parameters affects the CMS performance in long-term space missions and must be evaluated or eliminated. This paper presents a simple physics-based model of the discharging process with high charging/discharging rate based on the geometry of inertial sensors. After that, a disturbance observer sliding mode control (DOSMC) is proposed for the CMS with parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbance to maintain the TM charge below a certain level and improve its robustness. The simulation results show that the DOSMC is able to force the system trajectory coincides with the sliding line, which depends neither on the parameters or disturbances. In this way, the DOSMC can effectively ignore the parameter perturbation and external disturbances. The control precision can reach 0.1 mV, which is superior to that of a classic proportional-integral-derivative controller and conventional sliding mode control.         ",

We demonstrate a 3000 s atom trap lifetime, which enables us to optimize and measure losses at the $10^{-4}$ level that arise during imaging and cooling, which are important to array rearrangement. We perform both ground-state qubit manipulation with an integrated microwave antenna and two-photon coherent Rydberg control, with the local electric field tuned to zero via integrated electrodes. We anticipate that the reduced blackbody radiation at the atoms from the cryogenic environment, combined with future electrical shielding, should decrease the rate of undesired transitions to nearby strongly-interacting Rydberg states, which cause many-body loss and impede Rydberg gates. This low-vibration, high-optical-access cryogenic platform can be used with a wide range of optically trapped atomic or molecular species for applications in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.

    "abstract": "           Crystallization of proteins, specifically proteins of medical relevance, is performed for various reasons such as to understand the protein structure and to design therapies. Obtaining kinetic constants in rate laws for nucleation and growth of advanced biotherapeutics such as capsids, an assembly of macromolecules, is challenging and essential to the design of the crystallization processes. In this work, coupled population balance and species balance equations are developed to extract nucleation and growth kinetics for crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids. A comparison of model results with that of experimental data for capsid crystallization in hanging-drop vapor diffusion system shows that slow rate of vapor diffusion from the droplet controls the initial nucleation and growth processes, and the capsid nucleation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation in the microdroplet. Results also show that the capsids, which are of very high molecular weight (~3.6 MDa), have a similar tendency to nucleate as small organic molecules such as glycine (75 Da), low-molecular-weight proteins, and small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients due to its ball-shaped outer structure/shape. Capids also show a prolonged nucleation period as for proteins and other macromolecules, but has a slow growth rate with a growth rate pre-factor seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of lysozyme. The capsid crystal growth rate is weakly sensitive to the supersaturation compared to lysozyme and is limited by the transport of capsids due to slow Brownian motion resulting from the very high molecular weight.

Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Flexibly adjusting the intensity distribution of these beams is crucial for effectively realizing these applications. This study introduces a vectorial dual-beam system utilizing thermal atoms as the medium for modulating the intensity profile of vector beams. A single metasurface is employed to generate both the control and signal vector beams, each with unique vectorial characteristics. The shaping of the signal beam profile is facilitated by the interaction with thermal atoms, which can be controlled by adjusting the control vector beam. This spatially selective absorption is a result of the thermal atoms' response to the varying polarizations within the vector beams. In this experiment, two distinct metasurface chips are fabricated to generate vector beams with doughnut-shaped and Gaussian-shaped intensity profiles. By adjusting the incident power and polarization state of the control light, the doughnut-shaped signal beams can be converted into a rotational dual-lobed pattern or the dimensions of the Gaussian-distributed signal beams can be modified. This study introduces a novel vector beam shaping technique by integrating metasurfaces with thermal atoms, offering significant promise for future applications requiring miniaturization, dynamic operation, and versatile control capabilities.

Compared to the traditional electrical modulation approach, the introduced technique presents benefits from several perspectives such as the availability of mature and high bandwidth equipment in the near-infrared, circumvent the need of dedicated electronic components for the quantum cascade laser, and allows a direct link between the near and mid-infrared for amplitude to frequency modulation. We show that this stabilization scheme, used with a moderate near-infrared power of 5 mW, allows a tight lock to a radio-frequency generator with less than 1 mrad residual phase noise at 1 s integration time. We also perform a full characterization of the mechanism and evidence that the locking range follows Adler's law. A comparison with our recent characterization of the traditional method indicates that the optical approach could potentially lead to lower phase noise, which would benefit mid-infrared spectroscopy and metrological applications.

Their enhanced degrees of freedom make them highly versatile for exploring nonlinear wave phenomena and enabling advanced applications in optical communications and ultrafast technologies.

This study characterises soliton build-up dynamics in a self-mode-locked Tm-doped fibre laser, where both cavity birefringence and distributed saturable absorber play significant roles in the intracavity pulse shaping. The recorded single-shot spectra using the Dispersive Fourier Transform technique reveal generation regimes of singlet solitons and loosely bound two-pulse states. In later case, the observed intensity-dependent temporal splitting of vector soliton polarisations is also affected by the repulsive forces due to the interaction with synchronised and unsynchronised dispersive waves, governing the transition from transient pulse formation to steady-state generation. This study enhances our understanding of vector soliton dynamics and sets a solid foundation for further advanced exploration of their generation regimes across a wide range of nonlinear photonic systems.

The measured values of the dispersion characteristics using a white light interferometer coincided are in a good agreement with the calculated values provided by the manufacturer.

    "abstract": "           Resonances are common in wave physics and their full and rigorous characterization is crucial to correctly tailor the response of a system in both time and frequency domains. However, they have been conventionally described by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness of a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity in the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not hold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that even the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this information. Here we derive a quality function that fully characterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the signal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase and does not require the amplitude of the signal. It can be obtained by numerically calculating the spectral derivative of the phase from numerical or experimental acquisitions of the phase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression, which demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the resonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to retrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the characteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions without a priori knowledge on the physical system.         ",

Our neural network algorithm is trained on measured responses from several hundred HOIP solar cells, using three simple optical measurements of constituent HOIP films as input: optical transmission spectrum, spectrally-resolved photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence, from which we predict the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factors (FF) values of solar cells that contain the HOIP active layers. Determined average prediction accuracies for 95 % of the predicted Voc, Jsc, and FF values are 91%, 94% and 89%, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination of 0.47, 0.77, and 0.58, respectively. Quantifying the connection between ML predictions and physical parameters extracted from the measured HOIP films optical properties, allows us to identify the most significant parameters influencing the prediction results. With separate ML-classifying algorithms, we identify degraded solar cells using the same optical input data, achieving over 90% classification accuracy through support vector machine, cross entropy loss, and artificial neural network algorithms.

    "abstract": "           Quantum imaging encompasses a broad range of methods that exploit the quantum properties of light to capture information about an object. One such approach involves using a two-photon quantum state, where only one photon interacts with the object being imaged while its entangled partner carries spatial or temporal information. To implement this technique, it is necessary to generate specific quantum states of light and detect photons at the single-photon level. While this method has been successfully demonstrated in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, extending it to X-rays has faced significant challenges due to the difficulties in producing a sufficient rate of X-ray photon pairs and detecting them with adequate resolution. Here, we demonstrate record high rates of correlated X-ray photon pairs produced via a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process and we employ these photons to perform quantum correlation imaging of several objects, including a biological sample (E. cardamomum seedpod). Notably, we report an unprecedented detection rate of about 6,300 pairs per hour and the observation of energy anti-correlation for the X-ray photon pairs. We also present a detailed analysis of the properties of the down-converted X-ray photons, as well as a comprehensive study of the correlation imaging formation, including a study of distortions and corrections. These results mark a substantial advancement in X-ray quantum imaging, expanding the possibilities of X-ray quantum optical technologies, and illustrating the pathway towards enhancing biological imaging with reduced radiation doses.

    "abstract": "           In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons emerge either as bifurcations of linear topological edge states or as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. Although electrical circuits have proven to be a versatile platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observing edge solitons and their phase transition in circuit lattices remains challenging. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear electrical circuits and experimentally demonstrate the existence of both topological and nontopological edge solitons in a trimer circuit lattice, as well as the phase transition between these two types of edge solitons. Under weak nonlinearity, we observe antisymmetric and symmetric edge solitons bifurcating from their respective linear topological edge states. In contrast, under strong nonlinearity, nontopological edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric internal structures are discovered. Our work paves the way for exploring exotic nonlinear states and novel phase diagrams in nonlinear topological systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Compact and robust structures to precisely control and acquire atomic spectra are increasingly important for the pursuit of widespread applications. Sub-Doppler responses of thermal atoms are critical in constructing high-precision devices and systems. In this study, we designed a nanograting metasurface specifically for atomic rubidium vapor and integrated it into a miniature vapor cell. Using the metasurface with built-in multifunctional controls for light, we established pump-probe atomic spectroscopy and experimentally observed sub-Doppler responses at low incident power. Moreover, the sub-Doppler lineshape can be tailored by varying the incident polarization state. The spectrum transformation from absorption to transparency was observed. Using one of the sharp responses, laser stabilization with a stability of $3\\times10^{-10}$ at 2 s can be achieved. Our work reveals the effective control of atomic spectra with optical metasurface chips, which may have great potential for future developments in fundamental optics and novel optical applications.

    "abstract": "           Spin rotation is central for the spin-manipulation of lepton beams which, in turn, plays an important role in investigation of the properties of spin-polarized lepton beams and the examination of spin-dependent interactions. However, realization of compact and ultrafast spin rotation of lepton beams, between longitudinal and transverse polarizations, still faces significant challenges. Here, we put forward a novel method for ultrafast (picosecond-timescale) spin rotation of a relativistic lepton beam via employing a moderate-intensity terahertz (THz) wave in a dielectric-lined waveguide (DLW). The lepton beam undergoes spin precession induced by the THz magnetic field. We find that optimizing the lepton velocity and THz phase velocity in the DLW can mitigate the impact of transverse Lorentz forces on the lepton beam and increase the precession frequency, thereby maintaining the beam quality and enhancing the efficiency of transverse-to-longitudinal spin rotation. The final polarization degree of the lepton beam exceeds $98\\%$, and the energy spread can be improved significantly. Flexibility in adjusting the electromagnetic modes within the DLW adds further potential for spin-manipulation, and holds promise for advancing the development of spin-polarized particle beams, which have broad applications in materials science and atomic, nuclear, and high-energy physics.

While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges.

These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI.

However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.         ",

The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.

Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

    "abstract": "           Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling truly spatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionize modern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.

    "abstract": "           At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such non-trivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wavefunction, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near-resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.         ",

Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states.

In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the \"linear-like\" and \"bullet\" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the \"linear-like mode,\" emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized \"bullet mode,\" exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.
