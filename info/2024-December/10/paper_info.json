    "abstract": "           We present the first demonstration of a nanofabricated photonic crystal made from the magnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.         ",

A critical factor hindering optimization of the thermal flux across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface is the lack of any predictive model for the thermal slip length at non-cryogenic temperatures. An extensive study using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveals distinct power law relations governing this length scale which incorporate the influence of local temperature, in-plane translational order and vibrational frequency of the liquid contact layer and adjoining solid layer. Similar relations are expected to hold for other L/S systems modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential given the principle of corresponding states.         ",

Recently, synthetic dimensions have emerged as ideal platforms for investigating chiral edge states in multiple dimensions, overcoming the limitations of real space. In this work, we demonstrate reconfigurable chiral edge states via synthetic dimensions on an integrated photonic chip. These states are realized by coupling two frequency lattices with opposite pseudospins, which are subjected to programmable artificial gauge potential and long-range coupling within a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Within this system, we are able to implement versatile strategies to observe and steer the chiral edge states, including the realization and frustration of the chiral edge states in a synthetic Hall ladder, the generation of imbalanced chiral edge currents, and the regulation of chiral behaviors as chirality, single-pseudospin enhancement, and complete suppression. This work provides a reconfigurable integrated photonic platform for simulating and steering chiral edge states in synthetic space, paying the way for the realization of high-dimensional and programmable topological photonic systems on chip.

    "abstract": "           Light absorption in opaque solids is directly governed by optical transitions between the electronic states near the bandgap. This physical mechanism underlies the optical heating of a medium that efficiently absorbs light at resonance. However, such a strategy is true for a homogeneous bulk medium that is temporally dispersive. This work focuses on the optical heating of spatially dispersive (or nonlocal) materials due to broadband inelastic light scattering rather than absorption. A light-induced optical inhomogeneity (vacancy, ad-atom, etc.) produces an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum that enhances light-matter interaction. As a result, indirect optical transitions become accessible throughout the entire Brillouin zone due to electron-photon momentum matching. The real refractive index of nonlocal media can greatly increase over a wide spectral range beyond resonance. According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, such nonlocal media can capture light solely through electronic light scattering. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductors (silicon atomic-force-microscopy cantilever) and metals (gold shear-force-microscopy tip) under off-resonance continuous-wave laser pump. Light scattering based on electron-photon interaction becomes the dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion. These findings will be critical for cutting-edge technologies in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and biomedicine.         ",

    "abstract": "           Sustained mutual coherence between two combs over extended periods is a prerequisite for dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), particularly in achieving high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precise spectral measurements. However, achieving long coherence times remains a challenge for Yb-doped frequency combs. This work introduces an experimental approach for phase-stable DCS using Yb-doped frequency combs at 1.03 ${\\mu}$m with a novel feed-forward method, combatting the limitations of mutual coherence. Without relying on computer-based phase correction, we achieve a coherence time of 1000 seconds - three orders of magnitude longer than the current state of the art for DCS. This extended coherence enables time-domain averaging, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2045. We demonstrate high-resolution monitoring of weak overtone transitions in the P and R branches of C${_2}$H${_2}$, with good agreement with HITRAN. The phase-locked multiheterodyne system also enables phase spectrum measurements with a scatter down to 7 mrad. Furthermore, we successfully extend our technique to the visible wavelength range using second harmonic generation, achieving high-resolution spectra of NO${_2}$ with excellent SNR. The method offers high-frequency accuracy and demonstrates the potential of Yb-doped systems for multiplexed metrology, effectively extending the capabilities of DCS as a powerful tool for multi-disciplinary applications.

The analysis is performed by computing the transmission coefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the optical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric polarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two different optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is assumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a linear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary solitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster phenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single Kerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton states within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the intensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the excitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers is discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission states, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that causes the homogenization of the electric permittivity.

For precision applications involving weak signals, the responsivity as well as the accurate calibration of the integrated photodetectors at low optical powers become increasingly important. It remains challenging to perform a calibration traceable to mW-level primary standards without relying on external attenuation setups. Here, we utilize an on-chip attenuation circuit, composed of a series of cascaded directional couplers (DCs), to evaluate the responsivity of integrated photodetectors (PDs) at uW optical power levels with mW inputs to the chip. Moreover, we show that a pairwise measurement method, involving the simultaneous measurement of the integrated PD photocurrent and an auxiliary optical output which is coupled off-chip, systematically improves the experimental uncertainties compared to a direct PD photocurrent measurement. For 3 cascaded DCs, the pairwise measurement improves the repeatability error from 1.21% to 0.22%, with an overall expanded calibration uncertainty (k=2) of 10.13%. The latter is dominated by the scattering noise floor and fiber-to-chip coupling errors, which can be significantly improved with better device fabrication control. Our method can be extended to a fully integrated calibration solution for waveguide-integrated single-photon detectors.         ",

    "abstract": "           In the field of acoustic suspension or levitation of droplets against gravity, the application of Gorkov's acoustic radiation force for small particles (within the Rayleigh limit) or its extensions to larger ones (beyond the Rayleigh limit) is limited to predicting the suspension position of the droplet. Since this approach treats the droplet as a rigid particle, it fails to capture the fluid dynamics of the droplet and is also unsuitable for studying interfacial phenomena such as droplet deformation, splitting, or coalescence. In this work, we employ our recently developed acoustic body force in Eulerian form, which models the droplet as a fluid, to theoretically investigate the suspension dynamics of droplet subjected to standing waves through the interaction between acoustic, interfacial, and gravitational forces. Our theory predicts that when interfacial forces are dominant, the presence of positive and negative acoustic force regions within droplets exceeding the Rayleigh limit reduces the net acoustic force counteracting gravity. As a result, the suspension dynamics become highly dependent on droplet size, in contrast to droplets within the Rayleigh limit, where the dynamics remain size-independent. Thus, beyond the Rayleigh limit, as the droplet size to wavelength ratio increases, the critical acoustic energy density ($E_{cr}$) required to suspend the droplet initially rises sharply, which agrees with recent experimental results. After $E_{cr}$ reaches a local maximum at $d/\\lambda \\approx 0.65$, it exhibits a pattern of alternating decreases and increases, with each successive peak surpassing the previous one. Remarkably, our study reveals a size-dependent shifting of the suspension position between nodes and antinodes for droplets beyond the Rayleigh limit, whereas droplets within this limit maintain a consistent suspension position regardless of size.

    "abstract": "           Manipulating broadband fields in scattering media is a modern challenge across photonics and other wave domains. Recent studies have shown that complex propagation in scattering media can be harnessed to manipulate broadband light wave packets in space-time for focusing, imaging, and computing applications. Interestingly, while many proposed methodologies operate on intensity-based assessment of scattered fields, often in the spectral domain, from a pure transmission-function perspective, scattering operates as a linear field-level combinatory process, i.e., the superposition of transformation of unit excitations. As a result, we recently demonstrated that gaining experimental access to instantaneous scattered fields, as available through time-domain spectroscopy in the terahertz spectral range, in conjunction with sparse light excitation typical of ghost imaging, provides a key advantage in enabling the functionalisation of scattering, exposing a novel modelling paradigm. In this paper, we provide experimental proof of reconstructing 1-dimensional object features through a scattering medium using a fully broadband time-domain terahertz approach.         ",

By using full-wave finite-element simulations, we investigate the optical PSs inside metallic cavities excited by electric dipole sources. We determine the topological indices, morphology, and spatial evolutions of the singularities inside both spherical and torus cavities. We uncover the relationship between spatial symmetries and the PSs, as well as the mechanism underlying the emergence of polarization Mobius strips in the spherical cavity. In addition, we investigate the topological transitions of the PSs connecting two geometries (i.e., sphere and torus) with distinct topologies. The results provide insight into the singular and topological properties of light fields in optical cavities and can find applications in optical sensing and optical manipulation of small particles.

The results indicate that quantum effects result in lower kinetic energies all ions, deviating from classical predictions. Furthermore, quantum simulations exhibit broader angular distributions and more diverse ion trajectories, aligning closely with experimental observations. The research also highlights the role of laser intensity and the resultant ionization in enhancing quantum effects, particularly in modifying ion velocities and distributions.

    "abstract": "           Conventional silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are well established as light detectors with single-photon-detection capability and used throughout high energy physics, medical, and commercial applications. The possibility to produce single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) in commercial CMOS processes creates the opportunity to combine a matrix of SPADs and an application-specific integrated circuit in the same die. The potential of such digital SiPMs (dSiPMs) is still being explored, while it already is an established technology in certain applications, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR). A prototype dSiPM, produced in the LFoundry 150-nm CMOS technology, was designed and tested at DESY. The dSiPM central part is a matrix of 32 by 32 pixels. Each pixel contains four SPADs, a digital front-end, and has an area of 69.6 $\\times$ 76 um$^2$. The chip has four time-to-digital converters and includes further circuitry for data serialization and data links. This work focuses on the characterization of the prototype in an electron beam at the DESY II Test Beam facility, to study its capability as a tracking and timing detector for minimum ionizing particles (MIPs). The MIP detection efficiency is found to be dominated by the fill factor and on the order of 31 %. The position of the impinging MIPs can be measured with a precision of about 20 um, and the time of the interaction can be measured with a precision better than 50 ps for about 85 % of the detected events. In addition, laboratory studies on the breakdown voltage, dark count rate, and crosstalk probability, as well as the experimental methods required for the characterization of such a sensor type in a particle beam are presented.

The ECM is capable of predicting the overall surface impedance with any changes in the circuit's impedance. Three full-wave CEM simulations fully determine the EC, and the scattering parameters computed from the ECM for an embedded circuit, however complex, should be substantially similar to those produced by the full-wave code. With metasurfaces for which it is possible to obtain an ECM by this method, the reflection or transmission behavior of the surface under varying circuit conditions can be computed quickly without need of any further full-wave solutions. After highlighting the importance of fully characterizing parasitics in embedded components, we apply the method to the design of a varactor-based tunable metasurface, which upon fabrication and focused beam measurement demonstrates excellent model-measure agreement.

In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

    "abstract": "           Although entangled state vectors cannot be described in terms of classically realistic variables, localized in space and time, any given entanglement experiment can be built from basic quantum circuit components with well-defined locations. By analyzing the (local) weak values for any given run of a quantum circuit, we present evidence for a localized account of any circuit's behavior. Specifically, even if the state is massively entangled, the weak values are found to evolve only when they pass through a local circuit element. They otherwise remain constant and do not evolve when other qubits pass through their circuit elements. A further surprise is found when two qubits are brought together in an exchange interaction, as their weak values then evolve according to a simple classical equation. The weak values are subject to both past and future constraints, so they can only be determined by considering the entire circuit \"all-at-once\", as in action principles. In the context of a few basic quantum gates, we show how an all-at-once model of a complete circuit could generate weak values without using state vectors as an intermediate step. Since these gates comprise a universal quantum gate set, this lends support to the claim that any quantum circuit can plausibly be underpinned by localized variables, providing a realistic, lower-level account of generic quantum systems.

A key aspect of such experiments is the random determination of the observation device's status, typically controlled by a random number generator or a quantum-controlling apparatus. Here, we propose a novel version of the quantum delayed choice (QDC) experiment by tailoring the quantum state of the single photon into an arbitrary polarization superposition. In this experiment, the \"choice\" can be considered as being made by the photon's state itself at the moment of observation, thereby violating classical causality. Additionally, we observe the morphing behaviour of the single photon between wavelike and particlelike characteristics, which challenges the classical picture of waves and particles. Utilizing the quantum state of the photon rather than the quantum-controlling devices not only facilitates the implementation of the QDC experiment but also helps deepen the understanding of Bohr's complementarity principle.

Abandoning the notion of a preexisting universe or fixed manifold, RQD posits that observers, observed systems, and geometric structures emerge together as stable relational patterns in an underlying quantum substrate. Spacetime is thus recast as an effective, large-scale feature of entanglement and information flows rather than a fundamental stage. By eliminating pre-given observers and absolute properties, RQD unifies relational quantum mechanics, insights from holography and tensor networks, and non-dual philosophical traditions into a single idealist framework. Here, universal awareness is not an added element but the ontological ground, ensuring that subjective experience and physical reality co-derive from the same relational field. This approach not only demystifies the \"hard problem\" of consciousness, making it intrinsic rather than emergent but also resolves longstanding quantum puzzles, such as Wigner's friend and Frauchiger-Renner scenarios, by showing that no absolute vantage point or objective collapse is required. In harmonizing quantum theory, emergent geometry, and a fundamental awareness-based ontology, RQD reveals that quantum mechanics, gravity, and consciousness are facets of a single, integrated reality.

High-dimensional, or multipartite, quantum states are of specific interest, as they can exhibit unique properties both fundamentally and in application. The synthesis of high-dimensional, entangled photonic states can take the form of various schemes, which result in varying forms of entanglement. Frequency-entanglement is specifically attractive due to compatibility with integrated systems and resistance to decoherence in fiber transportation; however, increasing the dimension of frequency-entangled states requires a system that offers quantum interactions between a large set of distinct frequencies. Here, we show how the phonon-photon interactions of forward Brillouin scattering, which offer access to a ladder of optical resonances permitted by a single mechanical mode, can be used for fast-synthesis of frequency-entangled, single-photon W states. In our proposed system, simultaneous laser pulses of different frequencies dynamically evolve either an injected single photon or a heralded single phonon, generating W states of selected dimension and output frequency. This method enables the synthesis of `perfect' W states by adjusting the pulse amplitudes. In addition, we show how this system can be used for quantum frequency translation.         ",

However, conventional LiDAR face challenges in simultaneously achieving high ranging precision and fast measurement rates, which limits their applicability in more precise fields, such as aerospace, smart healthcare and beyond. By employing an asynchronous electrical pulse sampling strategy on a single optical frequency comb with a stable repetition rate and femtosecond-pulse width, we exploit the advantages of optical-frequency-comb ranging method and overcome the limitations of sampling aliasing and low data-utilization inherent in traditional approaches. This enables a significant improvement of LiDAR's performance to achieve micrometer-level precision and megahertz-regimes update rates over meter-range on non-cooperative targets.

Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse. The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.         ",

Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.         ",

These bright pulses exist in the normal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of domain wall locking that induces complex shape multistability, weak stability, and a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond the mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely defined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they are stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their potential for optical frequency comb (OFC) generation.

    "abstract": "           In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states close to a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix satisfies a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of rods on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as $-$54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.

In addition, our simulations and experiments further examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is key for implementation of viable CARS imaging techniques, due to the comparatively exceptional ability of YAG to generate supercontinuum which can enable higher-sensitivity imaging without delay lines.

Inherited from the deep learning black box nature, clear physical meanings have never been given for these complex diffractive networks at the layer level, even though the systems are visible in physical space. Using exemplified mode conversion systems, we show how various physical transformation rules within diffractive networks can be unveiled given properly defined input/output mode relations. Surprising physical transformation division phenomenon and an optical analogy of gradientvanishing-effect have been observed and discussed for high-dimensional mode sorting tasks. The use of physical interpretation for efficiently designing a parameter-varying network has also been demonstrated. These physically interpretable optical networks resolve the contradiction between rigorous physical theorem and operationally vague network structure, and pave the way for further interpret advanced deep learning tasks and other physical neural networks.

Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.

This study explores and compares two promising O-band defects in silicon: T centers and $^*$Cu (transition metal) color centers. During T center formation, we observed the formation and dissolution of various defects, including the copper-silver-related defect with a doublet line around 1312 nm ($^*$Cu$^{0}_{n}$), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength. We then investigate the photophysics of both T and $^*$Cu centers, focusing on their emission spectra and spin properties to assess their potential for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces. Additionally, we report a 25\\% broadening of the $^*$Cu$^{0}_{0}$ line under a 0.5 T magnetic field, potentially linked to spin degeneracy, suggesting that this defect may provide a promising alternative to T centers for spin-photon interfaces.

Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data.
