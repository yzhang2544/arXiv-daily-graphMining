    "abstract": "           A differential frequency microwave sensor for angular displacement detection is reported. A metal strip-loaded cylindrical dielectric resonator (SLCDR) is excited with a 50 ohm microstrip transmission line through a rectangular slot made on its ground plane. Analysis of the transmission coefficient (|S21|) of the circuit shows that for the parallel alignment of SLCDR, dual-transmission zeros are excited at frequencies fL and fH, while for the perpendicular alignment, a single transmission zero is excited at f0 such that fL < f0 < fH. In the range, frequency fL increases towards f0 while fH decreases towards f0. Based on this trend, a differential frequency parameter f = fH-fL is framed as the indicator of the angular displacement following a simulation study with ANSYS HFSS. Subsequent prototype fabrication and VNA measurement confirm the simulations with 15.5 MHz/0 sensitivity over the sensitivity over 900 dynamic range with excellent linearity. Subsequently, using linear inverse regression, the measured differential frequencies are mapped to the angular displacement, and the calculated regression metrics prove very good mapping.         ",

    "abstract": "           The stability and emissivity of the online calibration blackbody used in high-precision infrared remote sensing detectors in extreme environments are the primary limiting factors for their measurement accuracy. Due to the limitations of microstructure size effects, traditional calibration extended area blackbody cannot achieve an optimal balance between emissivity and stability, thus hindering further improvement in infrared remote sensing accuracy. This work proposes a new method that utilize suppressing near-field backscattering to control far-field reflectance. Specifically, through simultaneously reducing backscattering intensity and the backscattering solid angle, the reflectance is significantly reduced to an extremely low limit, which is validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, by combining the femtosecond laser self-convergent processing technique, the spontaneous energy negative feedback mechanism during femtosecond laser processing is utilized to achieve the fabrication of a high emissivity, thermally stable, mechanically stable, and highly uniform extended area blackbody. The blackbody fabricated using this technique can be applied for online calibration in various extreme environments, significantly improving measurement accuracy and service life.         ",

    "abstract": "           Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).         ",

Further, jet is acoustically forced with various frequencies and the effect of forcing frequency and momentum flux ratio is studied in detail. Instantaneous images, POD mode shapes and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots are used to assess the response of jet to forcing function, and the influence of crossflow. It is observed that the jet does not equally respond to all frequencies and the preferred frequency range is identified.

However, the weak PersL intensity accompanied by uncontrollability limits their practical application. Here we develop LiNbO3 (LNO):Pr,Bi phosphor with enhanced red PersL by trace doping Sm3+. The LNO:Pr,Bi,Sm phosphor exhibits quadruplet luminescence, including polychrome photoluminescence, PersL, and photo/thermo-stimulated luminescence (PSL/TSL). Particularly, the enhanced TSL can carry remote subjective information independent of the phosphor itself by controlling the temperature. A mechanism of afterglow enhancement is proposed based on constructing reversible photovoltaic cells and electrolytic cells by photothermal redox reactions using Bi3+ + VO and Bi3+/Pr3+ + VLi' ion pair.

However, the current coherent LiDARs suffer from the tight coupling between the high ranging-imaging performance and the high complexity/cost. Herein, we propose a narrowband parallel coherent LiDAR with frequency-interleaving architecture. The LiDAR architecture utilizes narrowband signals for ranging, and interleaves multi-channel sparse and narrowband signals in frequency domain at the receiving end to significantly reduce the required bandwidth and the number of detection branches, facilitating massive parallelization with low system complexity/cost. In experiments, a ranging precision of 0.49 mm that approaches the shot noise limit, and a power sensitivity of -95 dBm (~9 photons) are achieved. Parallel 3D imaging with an equivalent imaging rate of 10 Mpixel/s and a 2 cm ranging precision is also demonstrated using only two 150 MHz receiving branches. With these desirable properties, this new LiDAR opens an avenue for the LiDAR ecosystem.         ",

In this paper, we construct a vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packet and analyze its motion by solving the covariant Maxwell equations in a specialized optical material that is equivalent to curved spacetime. Our findings reveal that, within media, the relationships between intrinsic orbital angular momentum-dependent and spin-dependent separations can differ significantly. These results suggest that the optical OHE in materials cannot be accurately predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic orbital angular momentum in the SHE. Additionally, we compute the maximum deviation angle of the OHE in two experimentally viable optical materials. According to our results, in the first material, the transverse displacement can be successfully detected using current experimental techniques, which can serve as a reference for future experimental observations.

For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.1% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on QAE by demonstrating that high-quality results can be achieved on noisy hardware.         ",

However, many Brillouin Microscopes suffer from temporal instabilities that impact their performances, showing drifts in the acquired spectra during time that may lead to inconsistencies between data acquired at different days. The current method to solve this problem is to frequently (i.e. every 30 minutes) re-align the spectrometer and to perform repeated calibrations with standard materials. Here, we show a method to remove temporal instabilities of a Brillouin Microscope by inserting an Electro-Optic Modulator (EOM) that can be used: i) as a reference frequency during data measurements; ii) as a calibrator, allowing the reconstruction of the pixel-to-GHz dispersion curve with high precision, in an automatic pipeline and without the need for reference samples; iii) as a way to check the frequency shift of the system and compensate for drifts. We here show that our Brillouin Microscope, equipped with an EOM and a tuneable laser, was able to automatically acquire data for more than 2 days without the need to realign the spectrometer; retrieved Brillouin shifts and widths showed superior stability than standard Brillouin Microscopes. These results pave the way for a prototype of an automatic Brillouin Microscope that, once aligned, can automatically acquire data for hours or days.         ",

This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$.

A helicon thruster is an innovative electrodeless plasma thruster that works by exciting helicon waves in a magnetized plasma, and its antenna is capable of producing a uniform, low-temperature, high-density plasma. A magnetic nozzle is used to accelerate the exhaust plasma in order to generate a propulsive thrust. In this paper, we consider a simple helicon antenna, specifically the Nagoya type-III antenna. We consider a common experimental setup consisting of a quartz tube with finite length containing a uniform magnetized plasma and a Nagoya type-III antenna placed at the tube centre. Considering previous studies on helicon waves theory, we compare three different design methods, each based on simplifying different modelling assumptions, and evaluate the predictions of these models with results from full-wave 3D simulations. In particular, we concentrate on deriving a rational design method for the helicon antenna length, given the dimension of the quartz tube and the desired target plasma parameters. This work aims to provide a practical and fast method for dimensioning the antenna length, useful for initializing more accurate but computationally heavier full-wave simulations in 3D geometry or simply for a rapid prototyping of the helicon antenna. These results can be useful for the development of a helicon thruster but also for the design of a high-density radiofrequency plasma source.         ",

Here, we observe a novel collective emission phenomenon under X-ray excitation, breaking this limit and accelerating the emission. Our observation reveals that strong interactions between simultaneously excited coupled perovskite quantum dots can create collective radioluminescence. This effect is characterized by a spectral shift and an enhanced rate of emission, with an average lifetime of 230 ps, 14 times faster than their room temperature spontaneous emission. It has been established that such quantum dots exhibit superfluorescence under UV excitation. However, X-ray superfluorescence is inherently different, as each high-energy photon creates multiple synchronized excitation events, triggered by a photoelectron and resulting in even faster emission rates, a larger spectral shift, and a broader spectrum. This observation is consistent with a quantum-optical analysis explaining both the UV-driven and X-ray-driven effects. We use a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss g^(2) ({\\tau}) setup to analyze the temperature-dependent temporal response of these scintillators. Collective radioluminescence breaks the limit of scintillation lifetime based on spontaneous emission and could dramatically improve time-of-flight detector performance, introducing quantum enhancements to scintillation science.

    "abstract": "           An overview of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented, along with an explanation of how it sheds light on key quantum and relativistic phenomena. In particular, we show how the interpretation clarifies Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, wave function-based and entanglement-based nonlocality, interference effects resulting from the superposition principle, delayed choice experiments, quantum measurements, the mechanism of quantization, the reason why entities can establish entanglement bonds, and the statistical behavior of indistinguishable entities. We further argue that the interpretation can also elucidate relativistic effects, focusing on time dilation. Finally, we suggest that it can provide a novel and challenging perspective on evolution. This article is the second in a two-part series devoted to exploring this promising approach to reality. The first part, which serves as a companion to this discussion, outlines the intellectual trajectory leading from the first applications of quantum notions to human cognition to the bold rethinking suggested by the conceptuality interpretation.

However, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused by its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates and subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM network classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) attitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous states in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data acquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute vibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model combining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves significant results, and the proposed classification model consistently exhibits high accuracy compared to other models.

Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.         ",

We discuss solitons localized in the bulk of the array (bulk solitons), and at an edge of a finite-size array (edge solitons). The latter emerge due to the nonlinear interactions between a topological edge mode in the fundamental harmonic and bulk modes in the second harmonic. We reveal that for each type of soliton, bulk or edge, there generally exist two families of solutions with different internal structures and ranges of propagation constants. All bulk solitons can only be excited above a certain power threshold dictated by the coupling strength in the second harmonic field and the phase matching between the fundamental and second harmonics. The power threshold for edge solitons generally appears to be much lower, and, by tuning the phase matching, it can be reduced to zero.         ",

The focus of our research is placed within the context of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED), an area that explores the interaction of intense electromagnetic fields with charged particles. We propose new theoretical solutions that accurately describe these interactions by incorporating the effects of both the relativistic mass increase of fast-moving electrons and the influence of the electromagnetic field (or \"light itself\") within the plasma medium. Our approach diverges from traditional models by offering a more comprehensive treatment of the complex dynamics at play in these extreme conditions. Standard models of laser-plasma interactions often fail to capture the full spectrum of physical phenomena that arise when strong magnetic fields are present. In particular, the traditional assumptions about electron motion and radiation emission become less accurate, as the interplay between the laser, the plasma, and the magnetic field introduces additional layers of complexity. The novel solutions we present contribute to a deeper understanding of how radiation is emitted and interacts within magnetized plasmas, an essential aspect for advancing the development of next-generation laser-plasma accelerators. Our results underscore the limitations of conventional models and highlight the need for refined theoretical frameworks that can more accurately describe the intricate behaviors of particles and fields in these highly nonlinear environments.

Such lattices are described within the framework of non-Hermitian, non-dissipative physics and exhibit intriguing lattice phenomena such as lattice exceptional points, edge-states, entanglement and non-Hermitian skin effect, offering fundamentally new methods for controlling quantum fluctuations [1, 4]. Nonlinear resonators are suitable for studying multimode pair-generation processes and squeezing which are non-dissipative in \\chi(2) and \\chi(3) materials [5-12], but observing non-Hermitian lattice phenomena in photonic quadrature lattices was not achieved. Remarkably, in dissipative Kerr microcombs [13], which have revolutionized photonic technology, such lattices emerge and govern the quantum noise that leads to comb formation. Thus, they offer a unique opportunity to realize quadrature lattices, and to study and manipulate multimode quantum noise which is essential for any quantum technology. Here, we experimentally study non-Hermitian lattice effects in photonic quadrature lattices for the first time. Our photonic quadrature lattices emerge at Kerr microcomb transitions, allowing us to observe fundamental connections between dispersion symmetry, frequency-dependent squeezed supermodes, and non-Hermitian lattice physics in an integrated setup. Our work unifies two major fields, quantum non-Hermitian physics and Kerr combs, and opens the door to utilizing dissipative Kerr combs to experimentally explore rich non-Hermitian physics in the quantum regime, engineer quantum light, and develop new tools to study the quantum noise and formation of Kerr combs.

    "abstract": "           Acousto-optical modulation (AOM) is a powerful and widely used technique for rapidly controlling the frequency, phase, intensity, and direction of light. Based on Bragg diffraction, AOMs typically exhibit moderate diffraction efficiency, often less than 90\\% even for collimated inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that this efficiency can be significantly improved using a composite (CP) setup comprising a pair of 4-F-linked AOMs, enabling beamsplitting with fully tunable splitting amplitude and phase. The efficiency enhancement arises from two effects, termed \"momentum echo\" and \"high-order rephasing,\" which can be simultaneously optimized by adjusting the relative distance between the two AOMs. This method is resource-efficient, does not require ultra-collimation, and maintains control bandwidth. Experimentally, we achieved a diffraction efficiency exceeding 99\\% (excluding insertion loss) and a 35 dB single-mode suppression of the 0th-order beam, demonstrating a full-contrast optical router with a switching time of less than 100~nanoseconds. Theoretically, we formulate the dynamics of CP-AOM in terms of multi-mode quantum control and discuss extensions beyond the $N=2$ configuration presented in this work. The substantially enhanced performance of CP-AOMs, coupled with reduced acoustic amplitude requirements, may significantly advance our ability to accurately control light at high speeds with low-loss acousto-optics.

However, they have been conventionally described by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness of a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity in the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not hold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that even the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this information. Here we derive a quality function that fully characterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the signal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase and does not require the amplitude of the signal. It can be obtained by numerically calculating the spectral derivative of the phase from numerical or experimental acquisitions of the phase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression, which demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the resonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to retrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the characteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions without a priori knowledge on the physical system.         ",

    "abstract": "           Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through the time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we demonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.

    "abstract": "           Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.

Recently, Todorova & Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.         ",

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient for these computations. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems are based on single quantum circuits and, in many cases, use lattice-based methods. Current quantum devices are adorned with sufficient noise to make large and deep circuits untenable. We introduce a multiple-circuit algorithm for a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) solve of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method, called QLBM-frugal, aims to create more practical quantum circuits and strategies for differential equation-based problems. The presented method is validated and demonstrated for 2D lid-driven cavity flow. The two-circuit algorithm shows a marked reduction in CNOT gates, which consume the majority of the runtime on quantum devices. Compared to the baseline QLBM technique, a two-circuit strategy shows increasingly large improvements in gate counts as the qubit size, or problem size, increases. For 64 lattice sites, the CNOT count was reduced by 35%, and the gate depth decreased by 16%. This strategy also enables concurrent circuit execution, further halving the seen gate depth.         ",

    "title": "TAEN: A Model-Constrained Tikhonov Autoencoder Network for Forward and Inverse Problems",
    "abstract": "           Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder model-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAE achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.
