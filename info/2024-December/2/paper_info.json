    "abstract": "           Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution upconversion imaging system that converts low-intensity (down to 50 nW/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. The upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we present the first direct experimental evidence supported by numerical modeling of a turbulent plasma column formed during a gas-puff z-pinch implosion generated by COBRA current. Utilizing an imaging refractometer, we show a significant decrease in spatial autocorrelation of the laser field and the appearance of a laser speckle pattern shortly before stagnation. The intensity distribution of the speckles measured during different shot campaigns while employing long and short COBRA pulses follows the speckle statistics satisfactorily. The imaging refractometer data is proportional to the integral over electron density gradients; hence, the measured phase randomization of the individual plane waves comprising the laser field implies random density distribution. To validate this, the Beam Propagation Method code simulates the laser beam propagation through different artificial density distributions with various average fluctuation scales and generates synthetic imaging refractometer data. The results reproduce similar trends in the experimental data, such as the increasing vertical width for the decreasing average spatial scale of the fluctuations and decreasing spatial correlation length of the laser field. Therefore, during the gas-puff z-pinch implosion process, it is likely that the plasma flow is almost always turbulent with the average spatial scale of the turbulent density fluctuations decreasing towards stagnation.

    "abstract": "           Deep learning-based automated contouring and treatment planning has been proven to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiotherapy. However, conventional radiotherapy treatment planning process has the automated contouring and treatment planning as separate tasks. Moreover in deep learning (DL), the contouring and dose prediction tasks for automated treatment planning are done independently. In this study, we applied the multi-task learning (MTL) approach in order to seamlessly integrate automated contouring and voxel-based dose prediction tasks, as MTL can leverage common information between the two tasks and be able able to increase the efficiency of the automated tasks. We developed our MTL framework using the two datasets: in-house prostate cancer dataset and the publicly available head and neck cancer dataset, OpenKBP. Compared to the sequential DL contouring and treatment planning tasks, our proposed method using MTL improved the mean absolute difference of dose volume histogram metrics of prostate and head and neck sites by 19.82% and 16.33%, respectively. Our MTL model for automated contouring and dose prediction tasks demonstrated enhanced dose prediction performance while maintaining or sometimes even improving the contouring accuracy. Compared to the baseline automated contouring model with the dice score coefficients of 0.818 for prostate and 0.674 for head and neck datasets, our MTL approach achieved average scores of 0.824 and 0.716 for these datasets, respectively. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed automated contouring and planning using MTL to support the development of efficient and accurate automated treatment planning for radiotherapy.

However, ions in experiments are often excited to higher energies for which the Lamb-Dicke approximation breaks down. Here we construct a non-perturbative, semiclassical method for predicting the energy-dependent cooling dynamics of trapped-ion crystals with potentially many internal levels and motional modes beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. This method allows accurate and efficient modeling of a variety of interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of EIT cooling at high energies and the simultaneous cooling of multiple high-temperature modes. We compare its predictions both to fully-quantum simulations and to experimental data for a broadband EIT cooling method on a Raman $S$-$D$ transition in $^{138}$Ba${^+}$. We find the method can accurately predict cooling rates over a wide range of energies relevant to trapped ion experiments. Our method complements fully quantum models by allowing for fast and accurate predictions of laser-cooling dynamics at much higher energy scales.         ",

Here, we show a dual-functional microwave photonic system for concurrent radar and secure communication. The scheme utilizes microwave photonic frequency multiplying and frequency conversion techniques to shift both the intermediate frequency radar and communication signals to the same frequency band, enabling radar and communication operations at the same time and frequency. The high-power radar signal is also used to mask the communication signal, increasing the difficulty of signal interception and thus enhancing security. By employing de-chirping at the radar receiver and self-interference cancelation at the communication receiver, the radar function can be implemented and the communication signal can also be correctly demodulated after removing the radar masking. An experiment is performed. A 0.3-GHz bandwidth linearly frequency-modulated signal is quadrupled and superimposed with two up-converted 0.5-Gbaud orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signals. A communication data rate of 2 Gbit/s, a radar ranging measurement error of less than $\\pm$ 0.3 cm, and a radar inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging resolution of 12.5$\\times$10.2 cm are achieved.

Here, we achieved ultra-efficiency second harmonic generation (SHG) from high-Q polygon modes by maximizing the utilization of the highest nonlinear coefficient d_33 in a monocrystalline X-cut TFLN microdisk resonator for the first time. The polygon modes are designed and formed with two parallel sides perpendicular to the optical axis of the lithium niobate crystal by introducing weak perturbations into the microdisk of a tapered fiber, which maximizes the utilization of d_33. The polygon modes exhibit ultrahigh intrinsic Q factors of ~3.86X10(7), due to the fact that polygon modes are located far from the relatively rough sidewall of the microdisk. Moreover, the pump and second harmonic polygon modes share high modal overlap factor of ~80%. Consequently, SHG from cavity polygon modes with absolute conversion efficiency as high as 48.08% was realized at an on-chip pump level of only 4.599 mW without fine domain structures, surpassing the best results (23% and 30%) reported in other two domain-inversion-free phase matching schemes and even approaching the record (52%) in PPLN microresonators.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a system for tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectroscopy based on a scanning tunneling microscope. We successfully detected vibrational TE-SFG signals from adsorbed molecules on a gold substrate under ambient conditions. The phase analysis of interferometric SFG spectra provided information on molecular orientation. Furthermore, the observed TE-SFG signal was confirmed to originate from a highly localized region within a gap between the tip apex and the sample substrate. This method offers a novel platform for nonlinear optical nanospectroscopy, paving the way for the investigation of surface molecular systems beyond the diffraction limit.         ",

However, the limited performance of green and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, we tailored alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot-injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled us to successfully fabricate green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution-processed CQW-LEDs.

The high-performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal-based light-emitting diodes (Nc-LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals.

The formalism proposed is quite general and can be applied across a broad range of experimental parameters - focal lengths, beam profiles, and intensities. We adapt existing models of 1-color THz emission for use with the beam propagation model to calculate THz emission signatures. Two THz emission models are used, a 1D model and a more detailed 3D axisymmetric model. For the 3D axisymmetric model, simplified current source terms are derived by applying the slowly-varying amplitude envelope approximation. The two models give consistent results for the THz emission signal. For the test case considered, nonlinear propagation dynamics have a large impact on the amplitude of the THz signal, but only a minimal impact on the frequency content and angular distribution of the signal.

Also, LB4 is a good Raman-active material due to its high Raman gain.

Recent advances in integrated photonics, specifically the development of ultra-low loss silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) platform, have allowed attaining performance that exceeds conventional legacy laser systems, including the phase noise of fiber lasers. This platform can moreover be combined with monolithic integration of piezoelectrical materials, enabling frequency agile low noise lasers. However, this approach has to date not surpassed the trade-off between ultra-low frequency noise and frequency agility. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a fully integrated laser based on the Si$_3$N$_4$ platform with frequency noise lower than that of a fiber laser, while maintaining the capability for high-speed modulation of the laser frequency. The laser achieves an output power of 30 mW with an integrated linewidth of 4.3 kHz and an intrinsic linewidth of 3 Hz, demonstrating phase noise performance that is on par with or lower than commercial fiber lasers. Frequency agility is accomplished via a monolithically integrated piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator, which enables a flat frequency actuation bandwidth extending up to 400 kHz. This combination of ultra-low noise and frequency agility is a useful feature enabling tight laser locking for frequency metrology, fiber sensing, and coherent sensing applications.

Through theoretical and computational analysis, we show that spatially resolving time-domain spectral correlation functions using second-order correlation analysis can improve resolution by up to twofold for two emitters. This enhancement is achieved by quantifying the correlated to uncorrelated spectral fluctuations on different time scales at different positions. Experimentally, SFSR can be implemented using a combination of interferometry and photon-correlation measurements. The method works for non-blinking emitters and stochastic spectral fluctuations of arbitrary temporal statistics. This suggests its utility in super-resolution microscopy of quantum emitters at low temperatures, for which spectral diffusion is often more pronounced than emitter blinking.         ",

In general, quantum sensing enables high-precision measurements, opening ways to investigate high-energy phenomena that slightly modify energy levels of low-energy systems by higher-order perturbations.

    "abstract": "           In MRI-guided laser interstitial thermotherapy (MRgLITT), a signal void sometimes appears at the heating center of the measured temperature map. In neurosurgical MRgLITT treatments, cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (CSF), which may lead to temperature artifacts, also needs to be carefully managed. We find that signal loss in MR magnitude images can be one distinct contributor to the temperature imaging signal void. Therefore, this study aims to investigate this finding and more importantly. Also, this study intends to improve measurement accuracy by correcting CSF-induced temperature errors and employing a more reliable phase unwrapping algorithm. A gradient echo sequence with certain TE values for temperature imaging is used to quantify T2* variations during MRgLITT and to investigate the development of signal voids throughout the treatment. Informed by these findings, a multi-echo GRE sequence with appropriate TE coverage is employed. A multi-echo-based correction algorithm is developed to address the signal loss-induced temperature errors. A new phase unwrapping method and a new CSF pulsation correction approach are developed for multi-echo signal processing. The temperature imaging method is evaluated by gel phantom, ex-vivo, and in-vivo LITT heating experiments. T2* shortening during heating can be one important cause of the temperate imaging signal voids and this demands the multi-echo acquisition with varied TE values. The proposed multi-echo-based method can effectively correct signal loss-induced temperature errors and raise temperature estimation precision. The multi-echo thermometry in the in-vivo experiments shows smoother hotspot boundaries, fewer artifacts, and improved thermometry reliability. In the in-vivo experiments, the ablation areas estimated from the multi-echo thermometry also show satisfactory agreement with those determined from post-ablation MR imaging.         ",

However, Quantum-Mechanical (QM) datasets, crucial for MLIPs, are fragmented across various repositories, hindering accessibility and model development. We introduce the openQDC package, consolidating 37 QM datasets from over 250 quantum methods and 400 million geometries into a single, accessible resource. These datasets are meticulously preprocessed, and standardized for MLIP training, covering a wide range of chemical elements and interactions relevant in organic chemistry. OpenQDC includes tools for normalization and integration, easily accessible via Python. Experiments with well-known architectures like SchNet, TorchMD-Net, and DimeNet reveal challenges for those architectures and constitute a leaderboard to accelerate benchmarking and guide novel algorithms development. Continuously adding datasets to OpenQDC will democratize QM dataset access, foster more collaboration and innovation, enhance MLIP development, and support their adoption in the MD field.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.

For overcoming these issues, based on the geometric optics we propose novel theoretical models and methods to achieve lateral velocity measurement. Moreover, a novel axial distance measurement method using edge detection is presented, which can increase the lateral resolution by the order of one magnitude. The performance of the proposed methods are validated through simultaneous orthogonal velocity and distance measurements on a moving established metal specimen, showing the relative error and relative uncertainty can reach 10^{-4}. The versatility of this multi degree of freedom measurement method paves the way for its broad application across all laser triangulation systems. Therefore, this simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance sensing approach can propel advancements in dynamic behavior discipline, including but not limited to motion mechanology and fluid mechanics.

    "abstract": "           Two-color lasers with high coherence are paramount in precision measurement, accurate light-matter interaction, and low-noise photonic microwave generation. However, conventional two-color lasers often suffer from low coherence, particularly when these two colors face large frequency spacings. Here, harnessing the Pound-Drever-Hall technique, we synchronize two lasers to a shared ultra-stable optical reference cavity to break through the thermal noise constraint, achieving a highly coherent two-color laser. With conquering these non-common mode noises, we demonstrate an exceptional fractional frequency instability of 2.7E-17 at 1 second when normalized to the optical frequency. Characterizing coherence across large frequency spacings poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, we employ electro-optical frequency division to transfer the relative stability of a 0.5 THz spacing two-color laser to a 25 GHz microwave signal. As its performance surpasses the sensitivity of the current apparatus, we establish two independent systems for comparative analyses. The resulting 25 GHz signals exhibit exceptional phase noise of -74 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz and -120 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz, demonstrating the two-color laser's performance approaching the quantum noise limit of its synchronization system. It also sets a new record for the two-point frequency division method in photonic microwave generation. Our achievement in highly coherent two-color lasers and low-noise microwave signals will usher in a new era for precision measurements and refine the accuracy of light-matter and microwave-matter interactions to their next decimal place.

This bias field leads to magnetostrictive effects on magnon modes that induces phonons. We investigate the position fluctuation spectrum and the output field spectrum, finding that at G =0, the system displays a single peak, indicative of weak coupling between the optical and phononic modes. As G increases (e.g., G =0.1 kappa_a, 0.2 kappa_a, 0.4 kappa_a, we observe a transition to double peak, which reflects stronger coupling in the vicinity of cavity along with phonon modes that leads to normal mode splitting (NMS) in cavity magnomechanic system. Furthermore, we examine that the OPA amplifies the Y quadrature while squeezing the X quadrature of the output field spectrum. This sensitive behavior results in a more pronounced splitting in the Y quadrature spectra compared to the X quadrature. Our findings emphasize the essential role of the OPA in adjusting the interaction strength between the optical and phononic modes as well as underscore the importance of quadrature analysis in characterizing the system's response. NMS mechanism open avenues for advanced applications in quantum sensing and information processing, highlighting the potential for tunable devices in emerging quantum technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a statistical study of the transmission and dwell-time matrices in disordered media composed of resonators, focusing on how frequency detuning influences their eigenvalue distributions. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of transmission eigenvalues undergoes a transition from a monomodal to a bimodal profile, and back to monomodal, as the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the particles. Moreover, the distribution of dwell-time eigenvalues broadens significantly near resonance, with the longest lifetimes exceeding the median by several orders of magnitude. These results are explained by examining how frequency $\\omega$ affects the transport mean free path of light, $\\ell(\\omega)$, and the energy transport velocity, $v_E(\\omega)$, which in turn shape the observed distributions. We demonstrate the strong potential of wavefront shaping to enhance both transmission and energy storage in resonant disordered media. In the diffusive regime, where the system thickness $L$ exceeds the mean free path, both transmission and dwell time can be enhanced by a factor $\\varpropto L/\\ell(\\omega) \\gg 1$ when using wavefronts associated with the largest eigenvalues instead of plane waves. In the localized regime, the enhancements become $\\varpropto Ne^{2L/\\xi}$ for transmission and $\\varpropto N\\xi /L$ for dwell time, where $\\xi$ is the localization length and $N$ is the number of controlled scattering channels. Finally, we show that employing high-$Q$ resonators instead of low-$Q$ ones increases energy storage within the medium by a factor of $\\varpropto Q/k\\ell(\\omega)$, in both the diffusive and localized regimes.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method combining two-photon Ramsey spectroscopy with a technique to correct the second-order Doppler shifts on an atom-by-atom basis. Additionally, this approach suppresses systematic effects of the AC Stark shift to a negligible level compared to the target precision. Simulations predict that for both positronium and muonium, this method could improve the measurement precision of the 1S-2S transition by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art.

Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNP) are a unique type of upconversion nanoconverter, which can realize ultralarge anti-Stokes shift (>1000 nm) and high photostability, without photo-bleaching and photo-blinking. The excitation wavelength of LnNPs has been limited to the second near-infrared window (1000-1700 nm), mainly sensitized by erbium ions with absorption centered around 1.5 $\\mu$m. Here, we demonstrate novel self-sensitized holmium (Ho)-doped nanoconverters to further expand the sensitization range to the short-wave infrared at 2 $\\mu$m and achieve efficient upconversion to 640 nm. We show that this upconversion is a 4-photon conversion process with an underlying energy transfer upconversion mechanism. Via careful control of dopant concentration and shelling we achieve a relative upconversion-to-downconversion efficiency up to 15.2%, more than half the theoretical maximum. The placement of the Ho doped LnNPs into a plasmonic nanocavity device enables large gains in emission intensity (up to 32-fold), due to the dramatic shortening of the emission lifetime of Ho from 29 $\\mu$s to <1 ns, indicating a high Purcell-enhancement factor of 3x10$^4$. These results open new possibilities at the frontier of short-wave infrared upconversion and the nanoplasmonic enhancement of LnNP emission, with potential applications in detection, theranostics, photonics and optoelectronics.

    "abstract": "           Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the \"ripplon\" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.         ",

In this work, we extend the newly developed real space neural network quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the quantum phase transition of electronic and magnetic properties. Hydrogen chains of different interatomic distances are explored systematically with both open and periodic boundary conditions, and fully correlated ground state many-body wavefunction is achieved via unsupervised training of neural networks. We demonstrate for the first time that neural networks are capable of capturing the quantum critical behavior of Tomonaga- Luttinger liquid (TLL), which is known to dominate 1D quantum systems. Moreover, we reveal the breakdown of TLL phase and the emergence of a Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by abrupt changes in the spin structure and the momentum distribution. Such behavior is absent in commonly studied 1D lattice models and is likely due to the involvement of high-energy orbitals of hydrogen atoms. Our work highlights the powerfulness of neural networks for representing complex quantum phases.         ",

    "abstract": "           An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.         ",

These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.

However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.         ",

Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.         ",

However, manual tumor segmentation remains a significant challenge, spurring interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation. To accelerate innovation in this field, we present the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge, a satellite event of the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention. This challenge addresses the scarcity of large, publicly available AI-ready adaptive RT datasets in HNC and explores the potential of incorporating multi-timepoint data to enhance RT auto-segmentation performance. Participants tackled two HNC segmentation tasks: automatic delineation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and gross metastatic regional lymph nodes (GTVn) on pre-RT (Task 1) and mid-RT (Task 2) T2-weighted scans. The challenge provided 150 HNC cases for training and 50 for testing, hosted on Grand Challenge using a Docker submission framework. In total, 19 independent teams from across the world qualified by submitting both their algorithms and corresponding papers, resulting in 18 submissions for Task 1 and 15 submissions for Task 2. Evaluation using the mean aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient showed top-performing AI methods achieved scores of 0.825 in Task 1 and 0.733 in Task 2. These results surpassed clinician interobserver variability benchmarks, marking significant strides in automated tumor segmentation for MR-guided RT applications in HNC.         ",

For a given system we predict the nature of atomic ordering, its dependence on the magnetic state, and then proceed to describe the consequent MCA, magnetisation, and magnetic critical temperature (Curie temperature). Crucially, within our modelling framework, the same ab initio description of the material's electronic structure determines all aspects. We demonstrate this holistic method by studying the effects of alloying additions in FeNi, examining systems with the general stoichiometries Fe$_4$Ni$_3X$ and Fe$_3$Ni$_4X$, for additives including X= Pt, Pd, Al, and Co. The atomic ordering behaviour predicted on adding these elements, fundamental for determining a material's MCA, is rich and varied. Equiatomic FeNi has been reported to require ferromagnetic order to establish the tetragonal L10 order suited for significant MCA. Our results show that when alloying additions are included in this material, annealing in an applied magnetic field and/or below a material's Curie temperature may also promote tetragonal order, along with an appreciable effect on the predicted hard magnetic properties.

These modems transmit data through fiber optic cables that are thousands of kilometers in length at data rates exceeding one terabit per second. This remarkable technology is made possible through near-THz-rate programmable control and sensing of the full optical wavefield. While coherent optical modems form the backbone of telecommunications networks around the world, their extraordinary capabilities also provide unique opportunities for imaging. Here, we repurpose off-the-shelf coherent optical modems to introduce full-wavefield lidar: a type of random modulation continuous wave lidar that simultaneously measures depth, axial velocity, and polarization. We demonstrate this modality by combining a 74 GHz-bandwidth coherent optical modem with free-space coupling optics and scanning mirrors. We develop a time-resolved image formation model for this system and formulate a maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm to recover depth, velocity, and polarization information at each scene point from the modem's raw transmitted and received symbols. Compared to existing lidars, full-wavefield lidar promises improved mm-scale ranging accuracy from brief, microsecond exposure times, reliable velocimetry, and robustness to interference from ambient light or other lidar signals.

In this work, the construction of random forces is considered in Markovian and non-Markovian scenarios, and we ensure the dynamics satisfy the detailed balance in both scenarios. By comparing our E$+$$\\sigma$ with existing methods such as the electronic friction model and surface hopping, we furthermore validate its reliability. In addition, E$+$$\\sigma$ model still retains the high efficiency of the ED and does not incur much additional computation.
