    "abstract": "           A structure of a laser pulse may significantly influence the dynamics of interacting particles. In the case of dilute plasma the particle dynamics may be considered in the single particle approximation. In this paper the problem of the angular momentum gain of a single particle in a focused structured pulse is considered for some certain cases, including radial and azimuthal polarizations, in the frameworks of the theoretical model, presented in [E. Dmitriev and Ph. Korneev, 'Angular momentum gain by electrons under the action of intense structured light', Physical Review A, vol. 110, p. 013514, (2024)], which includes solving of Maxwell's equations with a required accuracy and the high order perturbation theory. The obtained analytical results are compared to the results of numerical simulations. Angular dependence in the structure of the laser pulse is shown to be critically important for the orbital angular momentum gain of an ensemble of charged particles in a structured wave.         ",

Analysis of the frequency equations relating Young's modulus to the out of plane and in plane flexural resonant frequencies of rectangular prisms has been conducted for both the fundamental frequency and its overtones at higher orders of vibration. The Young's modulus of three novaculite rocks with various porosities were then measured up to the seventh order of vibration to validate the optimum shear constant equation for estimating Young's modulus. Young's modulus was found to be nearly frequency independent for these rock samples.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a method for engineering harmonic frequency combs (HFCs) in the terahertz spectral region. This approach involves interfacing a quantum cascade laser (QCL) with an external reflector featuring frequency-dependent reflectivity. A notable advantage of this method over existing ones is its dual functionality in shaping HFCs, allowing for control over both the frequency offset and comb spacing based on the external reflectivity profile. Moreover, the resulting HFCs manifest as sequences of short pulses in the time domain. Consequently, our method enables the generation of ultrashort picosecond pulses passively, providing a distinct alternative to conventional pulse generation systems reliant on active bias current modulation, which struggle with modulation frequencies significantly higher than the first beatnote. This offers intriguing prospects for utilizing HFCs in pump and probe spectroscopy, a field already recognized in the literature as one of the most compelling applications of these states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these HFCs can be triggered from an initial condition of free-running unlocked dynamics, eliminating the need for assuming free-running comb emission. Thus, the utilization of an external, frequency-dependent reflector is capable of enhancing the coherence of the QCL emission.         ",

    "abstract": "           Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in planar photonic structures have attracted broad scientific interest owing to their exceptional capability to confine light. Topological robustness of certain BICs allows them to be moved in the momentum space by tuning the geometric parameters of the structure. In this work, we study such a BIC in a one-dimensional periodic grating, and find that its momentum-space position can be made a non-monotonic function of a geometric parameter, forming a locally bent ''V''-shaped trajectory. We show that, near the turning point of this trajectory, the robustness of the BIC and its $Q$ factor can be greatly enhanced. We tune such ''V-BICs'' to almost merge with a symmetry-protected BIC at the $\\Gamma$-point. This creates a ''K''-shaped ultrahigh-$Q$ region containing a BIC with a much higher and more stable $Q$ factor compared to the ordinary merging BICs. The ''K-BICs'' are also found to provide a strong enhancement of the $Q$ factor in finite gratings over an extremely wide range of geometric parameters. Our findings enable further advancements in the development of ultrahigh-$Q$ BICs and their applications.         ",

    "abstract": "           Thermo-optical nonlinearities (TONL) in metasurfaces enable dynamic control of optical properties like transmission, reflection, and absorption through external stimuli such as laser irradiation or temperature. As slow thermal dynamics of extended systems are expected to limit modulation speeds ultimately, research has primarily focused on steady-state effects. In this study, we investigate photo-driven TONL in amorphous silicon (a-Si) metasurfaces both under steady-state and, most importantly, dynamic conditions (50 kHz modulation) using a 488 nm continuous-wave pump laser. First, we show that a non-monotonic change in the steady-state transmission occurs at wavelengths longer than the electric-dipole resonance (800 nm). In particular, at 815 nm transmission first decreases by 30% and then increases by 30% as the laser intensity is raised to 5 mW/{\\mu}m2. Next, we demonstrate that TONL decouple the thermal and optical characteristic times, the latter being up to 7 times shorter in the tested conditions (i.e {\\tau}opt =0.5 {\\mu}s vs {\\tau}th =3.5 {\\mu}s). Most remarkably, we experimentally demonstrate that combining these two effects enables optical modulation at twice the speed (100 kHz) of the excitation laser modulation. We finally show how to achieve all-optical transmission modulation at MHz speeds with large amplitudes (85%). Overall, these results show that photo-driven TONL produce large and fully reversible transmission modulation in dielectric metasurfaces with fast and adjustable speeds. Therefore, they open completely new opportunities toward exploiting TONL in dynamically reconfigurable systems, from optical switching to wavefront manipulation.         ",

In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.

We have developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfect trajectories in the path integral formulation and the Monte Carlo sampling of the thermal distribution. We tested the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator and the results match well with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and is well suited for anharmonic system-bath interactions and multi-state systems.         ",

In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling\" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields.

We present an integrated workflow combining density functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space embedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation leverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT calculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. The enhanced binding energy of the thiol derivative aligns with experimental observations regarding sulfur-functionalized inhibitors' improved corrosion protection. The methodology employs the orb-d3-v2 machine learning potential for rapid geometry optimizations, followed by accurate DFT calculations using CP2K with PBE functional and Grimme's D3 dispersion corrections. Our benchmarking on smaller systems reveals that StatefulAdaptVQE implementation achieves a 5-6x computational speedup while maintaining accuracy.

Mutual coupling between the DMA's meta-atoms results in a non-linear dependence of the radiation pattern on the DMA configuration, significantly complicating modeling and optimization. Therefore, mutual coupling has to date been considered a vexing nuance that is frequently neglected in theoretical studies and deliberately mitigated in experimental prototypes. Here, we demonstrate the overlooked property of mutual coupling to boost the control over the DMA's radiation pattern. Based on a physics-compliant DMA model, we demonstrate that the radiation pattern's sensitivity to the DMA configuration significantly depends on the mutual coupling strength. We further evidence how the enhanced sensitivity under strong mutual coupling translates into a higher fidelity in radiation pattern synthesis, benefiting applications ranging from dynamic beamforming to end-to-end optimized sensing and imaging. Our insights suggest that DMA design should be fundamentally rethought to embrace the benefits of mutual coupling. We also discuss ensuing future research directions related to the frugal characterization of DMAs based on compact physics-compliant models.         ",

Our approach combines the double tensor-factorization method of Burg et al. with the the block-invariant symmetry shift method of Loaiza and Izmaylov. By extending the electronic Hamiltonian with appropriately parametrized symmetry operators and optimizing the tensor-factorization parameters, our method achieves a 25% reduction in the block-encoding scaling constant compared to previous techniques. The resulting savings in the number of non-Clifford T-gates, which are an essential resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, are expected to accelerate the feasiblity of practical Hamiltonian simulations.

Previous work relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons from these impurities.

Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. We observe resonance fluorescence and verify the emission coherence through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation also enables the direct measurement of the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, indicating high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically driven ionization process attributed to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We demonstrate that a low-power incoherent pump laser efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns.

    "abstract": "           Phased array transducers can shape acoustic fields for versatile manipulation; however, generating multiple focal points typically involves complex optimization. This study demonstrates that Dammann gratings - binary phase gratings originally used in optics to generate equal-intensity spot arrays - can be adapted for acoustics to create multiple equal-strength focal points with a phased array transducer. The transducer elements were assigned phases of 0 or {\\pi}, based on a Dammann grating defined by its transition points. Simulations show that simple gratings with two transition points can generate fields with up to 12 focal points of nearly equal acoustic pressures. Compared to conventional multi-focus phase optimization techniques, the Dammann grating approach offers computational efficiency and facile reconfiguration of the focal pattern by adjusting the grating hologram. We tested this approach in numerical simulations with a hypothetical high-resolution array, achieving up to 12 focal points, and validated the efficacy of the Dammann grating in a conventional 16x16 transducer array through both simulations and experiments. This comparison highlights that while Dammann gratings effectively generate multi-focus fields, the recreation ability of these gratings in a conventional array shows a lower resolution than the hypothetical array. This study underlines the potential of adapting binary phase functions from photonics to enhance ultrasound-based acoustic manipulation for tasks requiring parallel actuation at multiple points.

In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only 1% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions.

Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature.

    "abstract": "           We present a frequency tunable magneto-acoustic oscillator (MAO) operating in low-phase-noise and complex dynamical regimes based on a single composite YIG-GGG resonator. The magneto-acoustic resonator (MAR) is based on a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) layer epitaxially grown on a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrate. By optimizing the YIG thickness, we obtain a high magneto-elastic coupling of around 1 MHz between the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in YIG and high overtone acoustic resonances (HBARs) in the YIG-GGG structure in the 1-2 GHz frequency range. It allows to eliminate the need for pre-selectors and bulky circulators, thus simplifying the MAO design while maintaining the possibility to lock to HBAR YIG-GGG modes. With an adjustment in the loop over-amplification parameter, the MAO can be locked either only to high-Q magneto-acoustic HBARs or to both types of resonance including HBARs and the FMR mode of the YIG film. In a low-phase-noise regime, MAO generates only at certain values of the applied field and exhibits discrete frequency tunability with a 3.281 MHz step corresponding to the frequency separation between the adjacent HBAR modes in a YIG-GGG structure. In a complex regime where oscillation conditions expand to include both HBAR and FMR modes, MAO demonstrates continuous generation as the function of the applied field with variable phase noise parameters. Moreover, in low-phase-noise regime, MAO phase noise plot improves by 30 dB compared to the operational regime locked to the pure FMR in YIG which is in agreement with the measured FMR and HBAR Q-factors.

    "title": "Emulating photonic time interfaces via smooth temporal transitions",
    "abstract": "           The introduction of time as an additional degree of freedom to control wave-matter interactions have opened new avenues to fully control wave propagation in four dimensions (x,y,z,t). Time interfaces (rapid changes of the constitutive relations of the medium where a wave propagates) have recently become popular as they are the temporal analogue of spatial interfaces. While recent groundbreaking experimental work has demonstrated time interfaces from water waves, microwaves and the optical regime, rapidly changing, for instance, the permittivity of the medium requires carefully engineered structures. Here, we study the possibility of implementing smooth temporal transitions of the refractive index of the medium in order to mimic the response of time interfaces via adiabatic modulations. It is shown that indeed, as long as the signal is inside the structure during the modulation time, there are some values of rising/falling time of the adiabatic modulation that enables a full approximate emulation of a time interface. These results may open further avenues to explore by relaxing the speed at which the time-modulation should be introduced when designing four-dimensional media.         ",

    "title": "Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers",
    "abstract": "           Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.
