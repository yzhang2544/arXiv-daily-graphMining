    "abstract": "           Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.

Here, we investigate the Worthington jets generated during the water entry of solid spheres with no cavity formed experimentally and theoretically. Three different pinch-off modes are identified in experiments, which depend solely on the release height H and the diameter of the sphere D, regardless of the material of the sphere. A brief dimensional analysis of the experimental data indicates that the dimensionless maximum height of the jet h/D is proportional to the Froude number, defined as Fr=2H/D. Based on the basic solution of flow past a sphere and the application of a reasonable potential function near the free surface, a theoretical model is developed diverging from the Rayleigh-Besant problem. Predictions regarding the shape and maximum height of the jet show good agreement with experimental results.         ",

Here, we developed a black GeSn thin-film PD on silicon, optimised for efficient SWIR photodetection and imaging. Incorporating Sn into the Ge layer effectively extended the photodetection range to 1960 nm. The blackening of the GeSn surface resulted in a substantial reduction of reflection loss across a broad spectral range of 1200-2200 nm. Furthermore, the responsivity experienced a remarkable increase of 1.45 times through reduced reflection loss and carrier multiplication by the carrier ionization. The black GeSn surface significantly boosts the detectivity, enhances the wide-angle SWIR photodetection, and improves the quality of the resultant images. This demonstration heralds a new era for CMOS-compatible, cost-effective, high-performance black GeSn PDs and imagers for a wide range of applications in the underexplored SWIR region.         ",

Communication technologies rely on frequency mixing, enabling signals to be converted from one frequency to another and transmitted from a sender to a receiver. Technically, this process is implemented using nonlinear components such as diodes or transistors. However, the highest operation frequency of this approach is limited to sub-THz bands. Here, we demonstrate the upconversion of a weak sub-THz signal from a photoconductive antenna to multiple THz bands. The key element is a high-mobility HgTe-based heterostructure with electronic band inversion, leading to one of the strongest third-order nonlinearities among all materials in the THz range. Due to the Dirac character of electron dispersion, the highly intense sub-THz radiation is efficiently mixed with the antenna signal, resulting in a THz response at linear combinations of their frequencies. The field conversion efficiency above 2$\\%$ is provided by a bare tensile-strained HgTe layer with a thickness below 100 nm at room temperature under ambient conditions. Devices based on Dirac materials allow for high degree of integration, with field-enhancing metamaterial structures, making them very promising for THz communication with unprecedented data transfer rate.

This technique relies on the enhanced atomic spontaneous emission rate related to the counter-rotating coupling between the detector and massless scalar fields. Our analysis demonstrates that the integration of a cylindrical cavity, coherent light excitation, and multi-atom super-radiation significantly enhances the signal strength, as the radiation rate associated with the standard rotating-wave coupling can be greatly suppressed within the cavity. Compared to linear acceleration, circular motion can significantly reduce the atomic acceleration path length, leading to increased detection efficiency and lower experimental difficulty.

Under the influence of magnetic field millions of particles in solution form macroscopic shapes and when dispersed again at zero field they return to their original shape. The charge and magnetic behaviors of the particles are strongly dependent on the handedness of the chiral molecule in the hybrid organometallic compound. The microparticles forming the shaped structures are collectively coupled under the influence of long-range van der Waals exchange interactions which govern the collective macroscopic structure. There is striking evidence that the nonlocal quantum exchange interactions between particles persist up to a distance of 10 meters at temperatures above 00C. The forces which govern the collective memory effect and shape the macroscopic structure therefore allow to visualize quantum phenomena which extend the classical causality notion into an expanded nonlocal reality in which the quantum fields of the particles exist simultaneously at separated points in space. We propose that the observations are attributed to chiral electronic states dependent van der Waals interactions coupled to vacuum fluctuations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through the time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we demonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.

Efficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to operate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it particularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or spatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical DNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron and nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature. This necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental conditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument that facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields (10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment enables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the ability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse sequences involving millions of RF pulses.

This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz. Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively.

The interaction dynamics is analyzed near the strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED) regime. Our study finds new solutions in plasma media considering the effects of the re-normalized mass of relativistic electrons and the nonzero effective mass of accelerated photons. We have provided a general method for constructing exact solutions of the Dirac relativistic equation that correctly explains the dynamics of electrons in the strongly magnetized plasma medium. The modified solutions of the Dirac equation for one electron are derived and compared to the Volkov solutions. The new solutions are a basis for a feasible explanation of quantum attributes of relativistic electrons in a strong electromagnetic field of very short ultra-intense laser pulses with intensity near Schwinger field intensity. The solutions are called new Volkov solutions in a plasma medium. These solutions can be used to understand better the theory of quantum radiation reaction for the next-generation laser-plasma accelerator.

Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity \"transverse flying focus\" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\\,$pC charge, $1.6\\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\\,$% relative energy spread.

    "abstract": "           Suppressing high-frequency laser phase noise, particularly at frequencies near and beyond typical feedback bandwidths of a few MHz, is a critical yet challenging task in many advanced applications. Feedforward-based methods generally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances are more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\\geq 40$ dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2 MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50 MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.         ",

    "title": "Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication",
    "abstract": "           Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.

    "abstract": "           Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is a promising platform for nonlinear photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its strong light confinement, high second-order nonlinearity, and flexible quasi-phase matching for three-wave mixing processes via periodic poling. Among the three-wave mixing processes of interest, difference frequency generation (DFG) can produce long wave infrared (IR) light from readily available near IR inputs. While broadband DFG is well studied for mid-IR frequencies, achieving broadband idler generation within the telecom window (near C-band) and the short-wave infrared (near 2 micron) is more challenging due to stringent dispersion profile requirements, especially when using standardized TFLN thicknesses. In this paper, we investigate various standard waveguide designs to pinpoint favorable conditions for broadband DFG operation covering several telecom bands. Our simulations identify viable designs with a possible 3-dB conversion efficiency bandwidth (CE-BW) of 300 nm and our measurements show idler generation from 1418 nm to 1740 nm, limited by our available sources, experimentally confirming our design approach. Furthermore, temperature tuning allows further shift of the idler towards the mid-IR, up to 1819 nm. We also achieve a stretched wavelength range of idler generation by leveraging the longitudinal variation of the waveguide in addition to poling. Finally, our numerical simulations show the possibility of extending the CE-BW up to 780 nm while focusing on waveguide cross-sections that are available for fabrication within a foundry. Our work provides a methodology that bridges the deviations between fabricated and designed cross-sections, paving a way for standardized broadband DFG building blocks.         ",

    "abstract": "           A quantum transducer converts an input signal to an output probe at a distant frequency band while maintaining the quantum information with high fidelity, which is crucial for quantum networking and distributed quantum sensing and computing. In terms of microwave-optical quantum transduction, the state-of-the-art quantum transducers suffer low transduction efficiency from weak nonlinear coupling, wherein increasing pump power to enhance efficiency inevitably leads to thermal noise from heating. Moreover, we reveal that the efficiency-bandwidth product of a cavity electro-optical or electro-optomechanical transducer is fundamentally limited by pump power and nonlinear coupling coefficient, irrespective of cavity engineering efforts. To overcome this fundamental limit, we propose to noiselessly boost the transduction efficiency by consuming intraband entanglement (e.g., microwave-microwave or optical-optical entanglement in the case of microwave-optical transduction). Via a squeezer-coupler-antisqueezer sandwich structure, the protocol enhances the transduction efficiency to unity in the ideal lossless case, given an arbitrarily weak pump and nonlinear coupling. In practical cavity systems, our entanglement-assisted protocol surpasses the non-assisted fundamental limit of the efficiency-bandwidth product and reduces the threshold cooperativity for positive quantum capacity by a factor proportional to two-mode squeezing gain. Given a fixed cooperativity, our approach increases the broadband quantum capacity by orders of magnitude. The entanglement-assisted advantage is robust to ancilla loss and cavity detuning.
