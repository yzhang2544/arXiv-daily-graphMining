    "abstract": "           Quantum mechanics is a notoriously abstract subject, and therefore challenging to teach at pre-college and introductory college levels. Here we introduce the Bloch Cube, a hands-on educational tool which can illustrate key quantum concepts without equations. A series of videos have been created showing how Bloch Cubes can be used to teach concepts such as quantum measurement, quantum dynamics, pure states versus mixed states, and quantum decoherence. Bloch Cube states can assist in the development of more sophisticated concepts such as the Bloch Sphere, which plays a central role in the quantum mechanics of two-state systems and quantum information science.

The photonic mesh lattice configuration is generalized with polarization multiplexing to achieve a four-dimensional Hilbert space, based on which we provide photonic building blocks for realizing various quantum walks in non-Abelian gauge fields. It is found that SU(2) gauge fields can lead to Peierls substitution in both momenta and quasienergy. In one and two dimensions, we describe detailed photonic setups to realize topological quantum walk protocols whose Floquet winding numbers and Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin invariants can be effectively controlled by the gauge fields. Finally, we show how non-Abelian gauge fields facilitate convenient simulation of entanglement in conjunction with polarization-dependent and spatial-mode-dependent coin operations. Our results shed light on the study of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields in photonic Floquet systems.         ",

However, the studies of structured optical tweezers are usually accompanied by complex theoretical models, strict simulation conditions, and uncertain experimental factors, which may bring about high time costs and insufficiently precise results. In this work, we proposed a bidirectional neural network model for the analysis and design of OTs with optical vortices (OVs) as a typical structured light beam. In analyzing optical forces, the network can achieve over 98% accuracy and improve computational efficiency by more than 20 times. In further analyzing particle trajectories, the network can also achieve over 95.5% accuracy. Meanwhile, in OTs with OV-like beams, our network can still predict particle motion behavior with a high accuracy of up to 96.2%. Our network can inversely design optical vortex tweezers on demand with 95.4% accuracy. In addition, the experimental results in OTs with plasmonic vortex can be analyzed by the proposed model, which can be used to achieve arbitrary optical manipulation. Our work demonstrates that the proposed deep learning network can provide an effective algorithmic platform for the analysis and design of OTs, and is expected to promote the application of OTs in biomedicine.

Optimization of the DLW parameters has to take various factors into account like initial electron energy, THz pulse energy available, THz pulse width, DLW dimensions, etc. To maximize the final kinetic energy of the accelerated electrons, this study presents a comprehensive analytical/numerical guideline for cylindrical DLW LINACs. Additionally, graphic representations are introduced to visualize optimal designs for varying initial electron and THz pulse energies.

However, dispersion constraints such as phase-matching and doubly resonant conditions have so far limited demonstrations to narrowband operation. In this work, we overcome these limitations showing ultrabroadband resonant frequency doubling in a novel integrated device, wherein the resonant enhancement of pump and second harmonic are individually addressed in two distinct and linearly uncoupled microring resonators, each adjusted to target the respective spectral band. The two microresonators are designed and tuned independently, yet share a common interaction region that grants nonlinear coupling over a quasi-phase-matching bandwidth exceeding 200 nm, enabled by the inscription of a photoinduced $\\chi^{(2)}$ grating. The system allows to not only conveniently disentangle the design parameters of the two microresonators but also to reconfigure the doubly resonant condition electrically, and the phase-matching condition optically. We demonstrate milliwatt-level addressable second-harmonic generation over the entire telecom band and then configure the device to generate and upconvert a Kerr frequency comb with bandwidth exceeding 100 nm and upconverted power up to 10 mW.

The knock-on deuteron imager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these particles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense fuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images collected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the deuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of attempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential mechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged particles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion. A novel particle-tracing methodology is developed and utilized to create synthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the main experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude with a discussion of the outlook for KoDI, and potential considerations for other charged-particle diagnostics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Electro-optical modulation is widely employed for optical signal processing and in laser technology. To date, it is efficiently realized in integrated photonic systems as well as in bulk optics devices. Yet, the achievement of modulators exploiting Pockels effect in flat optics, essential to scale down the electric radiation-optical control in free space, currently lag behind bulk and on-chip integrated platforms in terms efficiency and speed. We bridge this gap realizing a metasurface based on lithium niobate (LiNbO3) on insulator that leverages on resonances with quality-factor as high as 8e3 to achieve fast electrical modulation of both linear and nonlinear optical properties. LiNbO3, well known for its high nonlinear susceptibility and wide transparency window across the infrared and visible spectrum, is employed to realize an asymmetric, one-dimensional array of nanowires, exhibiting resonances with linewidth < 0.2 nm. By applying a CMOS-compatible electrical bias, the metasurface imparts a relative reflectivity modulation around 0.1, with a modulation efficiency, defined as relative modulation per applied Volt, larger than 0.01 V^-1 on a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. We also demonstrated more than one order of magnitude intensity modulation of the second harmonic seeded by a continuous-wave laser, with a modulation efficiency of about 0.12 V^-1. This dual modulation capability, rooted in the interplay between optical resonances and electric field manipulation, holds significant potential for cutting-edge applications in high-speed photonics, nonlinear optics, and reconfigurable communication systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of LiNbO3-based metasurfaces for integration into next-generation optical technologies that demand rapid, efficient electrical control of light.

We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\\langle \\mathrm{\\hat{O}} \\rangle=\\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\\bar{Z}=\\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{\\hat{O}e^{-\\beta H}})$ and $Z=\\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{e^{-\\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time.

Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are imprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state probabilities. We derive the \"quantum sensitivity\" of parametric oscillators, linking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes, highlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum sensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a broader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based superconducting circuits.

If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent experiments demonstrate highly tunable nonreciprocal coupling between levitated nanoparticles due to optical binding [Rieser et al., Science 377, 987 (2022)]. In view of recent experiments cooling nanoparticles to the quantum regime, we here develop the quantum theory of small dielectric objects interacting via the forces and torques induced by scattered tweezer photons. The interaction is fundamentally non-Hermitian and accompanied by correlated quantum noise. We present the corresponding Markovian quantum master equation and show how to reach nonreciprocal and unidirectional coupling. Our work provides the theoretical tools for exploring and exploiting the rich quantum physics of nonreciprocally coupled nanoparticle arrays.         ",

    "abstract": "           The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.

Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.

    "abstract": "           We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \\(10^{-5}\\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. We provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimate.         ",
