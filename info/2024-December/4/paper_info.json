    "abstract": "           We theoretically propose a scheme to synthesize photonic non-Abelian electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the synthetic frequency dimension based on a polarization-multiplexed time-modulated ring resonator. Inside the ring resonator, the cascade of polarization-dependent phase modulation, polarization rotation, and phase retardation enables a photonic realization of minimal SOC composed of equal Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. The synthetic bands and associated spin textures can be effectively probed by the continuous-wave polarization- and time-resolved band structure measurements. Meanwhile, the pulse dynamics in the frequency dimension can be manipulated by both synthetic Abelian and non-Abelian electric fields, leading to Bloch oscillation, Zitterbewegung, and their interplay dynamics. Our proposed setup can be realized with free-space optics, fibers, and integrated photonics, and provides pseudospin control knobs for large-scale synthetic lattices based on frequency combs.

    "title": "Main problems in constructing quantum theory based on finite mathematics",
    "abstract": "           As shown in our publications, quantum theory based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ (FQT) is more general than standard quantum theory (SQT) because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit $p\\to\\infty$. One of the main differences between SQT and FQT is the following. In SQT, elementary objects are described by irreducible representations (IRs) of a symmetry algebra in which energies are either only positive or only negative and there are no IRs where there are states with different signs of energy. In the first case, objects are called particles, and in the second - antiparticles. As a consequence, in SQT it is possible to introduce conserved quantum numbers (electric charge, baryon number, etc.) so that particles and antiparticles differ in the signs of these numbers. However, in FQT, all IRs necessarily contain states with both signs of energy. The symmetry in FQT is higher than the symmetry in SQT because one IR in FQT splits into two IRs in SQT with positive and negative energies at $p\\to\\infty$. Consequently, most fundamental quantum theory will not contain the concepts of particle-antiparticle and additive quantum numbers. These concepts are only good approximations at present since at this stage of the universe the value $p$ is very large but it was not so large at earlier stages. The above properties of IRs in SQT and FQT have been discussed in our publications with detailed technical proofs. The purpose of this paper is to consider models where these properties can be derived in a much simpler way.         ",

At the end of this program, they will be ready to join the quantum workforce. We detail the creative process leading to a coherent curriculum, as well as why the local ecosystem led to these choices.

The pulses exhibit temporal distributions of their instantaneous frequencies with opposite slopes. As a result, interaction between the beat frequency evolving over time and a photoconductor produces a broad THz spectrum with temporal variations. In our experimental setup, we generate a 12 ps-long pulse with a 1 THz bandwidth spectrum, featuring a frequency ramp of 90 GHz/ps, resembling a chirped THz pulse.

    "abstract": "           We develop an effective computational tool for simulating the scattering of 1D waves by a composite layer architected in an otherwise homogeneous medium. The layer is designed as the union of segments cut from various mother periodic media, which allows us to describe the wavefield in each segment in terms of the ``left'' and ``right'' Bloch waves. For a given periodic medium and frequency of oscillations, the latter are computed by solving the quadratic eigenvalue problem which seeks the wavenumber -- and affiliated eigenstate -- of a Bloch wave. In this way the scattering problem is reduced to a low-dimensional algebraic problem, solved via the transfer matrix approach, that seeks the amplitudes of the featured Bloch waves, amplitude of the reflected wave, and that of the transmitted wave. Such an approach inherently caters for an optimal filter design as it enables rapid exploration of the design space with respect to segment (i) permutations, (ii) cut lengths, and (iii) cut offsets relative to the mother periodic media. Specifically, under (i)--(iii) the Bloch eigenstates remain invariant, so that only the transfer matrices need to be recomputed. The reduced order model is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Example simulations demonstrate 40x computational speedup when optimizing a 1D filter for minimum transmission via a genetic algorithm approach that entails $O(10^6)$ trial configurations. Relative to the classical rainbow trap design where the unit cells of the mother periodic media are arranged in a ``linear'' fashion according to their dispersive characteristics, the GA-optimized (rearranged) configuration yields a $40\\%$ reduction in filter transmissibility over the target frequency range, for the same filter thickness.

The basic idea is to postulate that the preferences of these agents are indeterminate (in the quantum sense of the term) before the choice is made or the decision is taken. An agent's state before the decision is represented by a superposition of potential preferences. The decision is assimilated to a measure of the agent's state and leads to a projection of the state onto one of the particular preferences. We therefore consider that uncertainty about preferences is not linked to incomplete information but to essential indeterminacy. We explore the consequences of these hypotheses on the usual concepts of decision theory and apply the formalism to the problem of the so-called \"framing\" effect.         ",

    "abstract": "           Reducing optical losses is crucial for reducing quantum noise in gravitational-wave detectors. Losses are the main source of degradation of the squeezed vacuum. Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity is currently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Such filter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce the optimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularly detrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within the cavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noise reduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of the optical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of the Virgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses with respect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses depend clearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87 ppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61 ppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical error smaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different with respect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performed before the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major loss mechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The larger discrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination. In addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodology described in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position for which the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. This work can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for the optical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallic interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials. Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history, and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However, due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to improve this nonlinear effect.

The latter finally absorbs the energy and emits an electron which exhibits the aforementioned circular dichroism in its angular distribution. We study the process on the basis of the retarded dipole--dipole interaction and report an asymptotic analytic expression for the distance-dependent chiral asymmetry of the photoelectron as induced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay for random line-of-sight and acceptor orientations. In the nonretarded limit, the predicted chiral asymmetry is reversed as compared to that of a direct photoelectron circular dichroism of the molecule.         ",

    "abstract": "           While passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been advanced for monitoring acoustic cavitation activity in focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy, achieving both real-time and high-quality imaging capabilities is still challenging. The angular spectrum (AS) method presents the most efficient algorithm for PAM, but it suffers from artifacts and low resolution due to the diffraction pattern of the imaging array. Data-adaptive beamformers suppress artifacts well, but their overwhelming computational complexity, more than two orders of magnitude higher than the classical time exposure acoustic (TEA) method, hinders their application in real-time. In this work, we introduce the cross-correlated AS method to address the challenge. This method is based on cross-correlating the AS back-propagated wave fields, in the frequency domain, measured by different apodized sub-apertures of the transducer array to provide the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) matrix for artifacts suppression. We observed that the spatial pattern of NCC matrix is variable which can be utilized by the triple apodization with cross-correlation (TAX) with AS scheme, namely the AS-TAX method, for optimal artifacts suppression outcomes. Both the phantom and mouse tumor experiments showed that: 1) the AS-TAX method has comparable image quality as the data-adaptive beamformers, reducing the energy spread area by 34.8-66.6% and improving image signal-to-noise ratio by 10.7-14.5 dB compared to TEA; 2) it reduces the computational complexity by two orders of magnitude compared to TEA allowing millisecond-level image reconstruction speed with a parallel implementation; 3) it can well map microbubble cavitation activity of different status (stable or inertial). The AS-TAX method represents a real-time approach to monitor cavitation-based FUS therapy with high image quality.         ",

    "abstract": "           HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna. This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators (1.84{\\lambda}*1.84{\\lambda}*0.032{\\lambda}, where{\\lambda}is the free space wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and 28\u00b0 respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a HPBW of 27\u00b0 at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems, such as car to car communications.         ",

As a consequence of the cavity geometry, the TBL is subjected to alternating streamwise pressure gradients: from an adverse pressure gradient (APG) to a favourable pressure gradient and back to an APG. The mean streamwise velocity and turbulence stresses over the cavity show that the streamwise pressure gradients and air injection are the dominant perturbations to the flow, with streamline curvature concluded to be marginal. Two-point correlations of the wall-normal velocity reveal an increased coherent extent over the cavity and a local anisotropy in regions under an APG, distinct from traditional APG TBLs, suggesting possible history effects.

    "abstract": "           Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model to investigate whether the ability of two quantum entangled particles to \"correlate\" their behaviors even at very large distances and in the absence of any physical connection can be seen as due to an exchange of information through an extra-temporal dimension. Since superluminal information exchange is forbidden in our (3,1) spacetime, an extra-temporal dimension is needed to recover the physical picture of finite velocity information exchange between entangled entities. Assuming that the geometry of space-time of dimension (3,2) is described by a metric containing a warping factor, the confinement of the massive particles in the extra time dimension follows. Therefore, why we do not experience an infinitely large extra time dimension can be explained. The toy model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wavefunction collapse using nonlinear (non-unitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model so obtained is just speculative without any claim of being robust against any criticism, nevertheless, it satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be verified experimentally; in fact, it proposes an experiment potentially interesting which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful.         ",

The energy is not conserved within momentum bandgaps, and eigenmodes with exponentially growing amplitudes exist in the momentum bandgap. Such properties make photonic time crystals a fascinating novel class of artificial materials from a basic science and applied perspective. This tutorial overviews the fundamental electromagnetic equations governing photonic time crystals and explores the groundbreaking physical phenomena they support. Based on these properties, we also oversee a diverse range of applications they unlock. Different material platforms suitable for creating photonic time crystals are discussed and compared.

Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $>10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and <2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.

Topological robustness of certain BICs allows them to be moved in the momentum space by tuning the geometric parameters of the structure. In this work, we study such a BIC in a one-dimensional periodic grating, and find that its momentum-space position can be made a non-monotonic function of a geometric parameter, forming a locally bent ''V''-shaped trajectory. We show that, near the turning point of this trajectory, the robustness of the BIC and its $Q$ factor can be greatly enhanced. We tune such ''V-BICs'' to almost merge with a symmetry-protected BIC at the $\\Gamma$-point. This creates a ''K''-shaped ultrahigh-$Q$ region containing a BIC with a much higher and more stable $Q$ factor compared to the ordinary merging BICs. The ''K-BICs'' are also found to provide a strong enhancement of the $Q$ factor in finite gratings over an extremely wide range of geometric parameters.

In this work, we consider perturbing fields which are themselves non-Hermitian, in the form of complex external electric fields, which are realizable as gain/loss gradients. We derive the full set of semiclassical equations of motion and show that the anomalous velocity depends not only on the Berry curvature, but on the entirety of the quantum geometric tensor, including the quantum metric. This quantum metric dependent velocity appears regardless of whether the unperturbed Hamiltonian is Hermitian or not.

We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on $\\textit{local}$ error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the 2D classical Ising model and 4D toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared to a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a sub-threshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory.

In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relation between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of didactic applications of time-dependent harmonic oscillators and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a harmonic oscillator which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.
