    "abstract": "           Laser wakefield accelerator experiments have made enormous progress over the past $\\sim 20$ years, but their promise to revolutionize high-energy particle sources is only beginning to be realized. To make the next step toward engineering LWFAs for different accelerator outcomes, we need more reliable and quantitative models to predict performance. Using the data from $>50$ published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 \\si{\\micro\\meter}, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a $\\gtrsim 30$ PW laser operating at electron density $<10^{17}/$cm$^3$.

    "abstract": "           We propose a short-term wind forecasting framework for predicting real-time variations in atmospheric turbulence based on nacelle-mounted anemometer and ground-level air-pressure measurements. Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.

    "abstract": "           In the realm of lithography, Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a crucial resolution enhancement technique that optimizes the transmission function of photomasks on a pixel-based to effectively counter Optical Proximity Effects (OPE). However, conventional pixel-based OPC methods often generate patterns that pose manufacturing challenges, thereby leading to the increased cost in practical scenarios. This paper presents a novel inverse lithographic approach to OPC, employing a model-driven, block stacking deep learning framework that expedites the generation of masks conducive to manufacturing. This method is founded on vector lithography modelling and streamlines the training process by eliminating the requirement for extensive labeled datasets. Furthermore, diversity of mask patterns is enhanced by employing a wave function collapse algorithm, which facilitates the random generation of a multitude of target patterns, therefore significantly expanding the range of mask paradigm. Numerical experiments have substantiated the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end approach, highlighting its superior capability to manage mask complexity within the context of advanced OPC lithography. This advancement is anticipated to enhance the feasibility and economic viability of OPC technology within actual manufacturing environments.         ",

    "abstract": "           The discovery of laser wakefield acceleration in gaseous plasma was a major milestone that could lead to a significant reduction of size and cost of large electron accelerators. For higher-energy laser-driven electron acceleration guiding plasma channels were proposed, which are matched to the laser pulse parameters. For guiding a Gaussian beam, a parabolic density profile is needed, which is difficult to realize experimentally. The realistic channel profiles can be described by higher order polynomial functions which are not optimal for guiding due to the development of undesired distortions in the laser intensity envelope. However, here we show that for non-parabolic plasma channels well-defined matching conditions exist, which we call mode matching. This leads to the guiding of the fundamental mode only in the acceleration regime, where the plasma electron density is modulated by the high-intensity laser pulse. In this way, we eliminate two deteriorating factors of laser wakefield acceleration, namely the mode dispersion and energy leakage. We apply this new matching condition for single-mode guiding in quasi-3D simulations to show that 10 GeV energies can be reached in a distance of less than 15 cm.         ",

In our protocol, each network user employs a unique pseudo-random sequence to rapidly change the optical frequency among many distinct frequencies. After transmission through the optical network, each user correlates the received sequence with the transmitted one, thus establishing a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technique that helps reject optical signals transmitted by other users in the network. Our method, which builds on the work by Schediwy et al. [Opt. Lett. {\\bf 38}, 2893 (2013)], improves the frequency distribution network's capacity, helps reject phase noise caused by intermediate optical back scattering, and simplifies the operational requirements. Using this protocol, we show that a frequency instability better than ~$10^{-18}$ while having more than 100 users operating in the network should be possible. Finally, we theoretically explore the limits of this protocol and show that the demonstrated stability does not suffer from any fundamental limitation. In the future, the CDMA method presented here could be used in complex time-frequency distribution networks, allowing more users while, at the same time, reducing the network's complexity.         ",

With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.

By approximating the raceway as a hollow cylinder, we derive straightforward 4x4 systems for its vibrational modes, enabling both forward and inverse problem-solving. We also demonstrate how to significantly reduce the number of required sensors by using a simple prior: the known number of rollers and their angular speed.

Consequently, in the presence of the resonant channel, the acquired polarization can be clearly observed even for light ions when it is challenging to discern which state of the ion was excited in the process. We also show that the energy dependence of the polarization parameter clearly demonstrates strong interference both between the contributions of specific autoionizing states in the resonant channel and between the non-resonant and resonant channels.

Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.         ",

    "abstract": "           We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements.

    "abstract": "           We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.

    "abstract": "           Linear measurement is an important class of measurements for sensing classical signals including gravitational wave (GW), dark matter, infrared ray, rotation rate, etc. In this Letter, we focus on multiparameter linear measurement and establish a general tradeoff relation that tightly constrains the fundamental quantum limits of two independent parameters in a monochromatic classical signal detected by any linear quantum device. Such a tradeoff relation is universal and fundamental for multiparameter linear measurement since arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Compared with the Holevo Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, our tradeoff bound can completely identify the dependence between the attainable precision limits on estimated parameters. The dependence becomes more obvious such that the individual precision can not simultaneously reach the quantum limit as the so-called incompatible coefficient rises. Eventually, we find a necessary condition under which an optimal measurement protocol can saturate the general tradeoff relation, and show that the measurement phase can be tuned for adjusting different precision weight. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.

Accurately diagnosing the transient energy chirp, which evolves rapidly at the onset of acceleration, presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel method for reconstructing the transient energy chirp of ultrashort electron beams by employing tightly focused and chirped laser pulses. We investigate the conditions that enhance the modulation of electron-beam divergence and illustrate the reconstruction of transient chirp based on the intrinsic phase correlation of the modulated divergence as projected onto specific phase space coordinates. Additionally, we estimate the temporal delay between the laser and electron beam by applying a Fourier transform to the reconstructed divergence modulation in the frequency domain. This approach holds promise for optimizing accelerator performance and facilitates the probing of timing jitter in ultrafast electron diffraction with attosecond-level precision.         ",

    "abstract": "           We report the upgrade and operation of a frequency-comb-assisted high-resolution mid-infrared molecular spectrometer allowing us to combine high spectral purity, SI-traceability, wide tunability and high sensitivity. An optical frequency comb is used to transfer the spectral purity of a SI-traceable 1.54 $\\mu$m metrology-grade frequency reference to a 10.3 $\\mu$m quantum cascade laser (QCL). The near-infrared reference is operated at the French time/frequency metrology institute, calibrated there to primary frequency standards, and transferred to Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers via the REFIMEVE fiber network. The QCL exhibits a line width of $\\delta\\nu\\sim 0.1$ Hz, a sub-$10^{-15}$ relative frequency stability from 0.1 to 10 s and its frequency is traceable to the SI with a total relative uncertainty better than $4\\times10^{-14}$ after 1-s averaging time. We have developed the instrumentation allowing comb modes to be continuously tuned over 9 GHz resulting in a QCL of record spectral purity uninterruptedly tunable at the precision of the reference over an unprecedented span of $\\Delta\\nu$ = 1.4 GHz. We have used our apparatus to conduct sub-Doppler spectroscopy of methanol in a multi-pass cell, demonstrating state-of-art frequency uncertainties down to the few kilohertz level ($\\sim10^{-10}$ in relative value). We have observed weak intensity resonances unreported so far, resolved subtle doublets never seen before and brought to light discrepancies with the HITRAN database. This demonstrates the potential of our apparatus for probing subtle internal molecular processes, building accurate spectroscopic models of polyatomic molecules of atmospheric or astrophysical interest, and carrying out precise spectroscopic tests of fundamental physics.

    "abstract": "           Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.         ",

Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.

Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.

However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.         ",

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm.
