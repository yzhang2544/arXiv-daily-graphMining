    "abstract": "           Terahertz (THz) communications have emerged as a promising technology for 6G networks due to their potential for achieving terabit-per-second data rates. However, the impact of rainfall on THz channel characteristics remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. This article presents a systematic measurement-based and theoretical investigation of line-of-sight (LoS) THz channel behavior under rainfall conditions, methodically examining both power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. Our experimental campaign, conducted at frequencies of 220-230 GHz over a 54-meter outdoor channel, is complemented by analytical frameworks incorporating ITU-R and Mie scattering models. The study reveals that while rain induces significant power attenuation, multipath scattering effects remain minimal, with Rician K-factors maintaining high values. Notably, we observe substantial variations in power loss under constant rain rates, attributed to dynamic changes in raindrop size distribution. Comparative analysis demonstrates superior BER performance of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in rainfall conditions, while revealing increased environmental sensitivity at higher frequencies. These findings underscore the necessity for adaptive modulation schemes and strategic frequency planning in future THz communication systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Photonics has unlocked the potential for energy-efficient acceleration of deep learning. Most approaches toward photonic deep learning have diligently reproduced traditional deep learning architectures using photonic platforms, separately implementing linear-optical matrix calculations and nonlinear activations via electro-optical conversion, optical nonlinearities, and signal-encoded materials. Here we propose a concept of nonlinear unitary photonic circuits to achieve the integration of linear and nonlinear expressivity essential for deep neural networks. We devise a building block for two-dimensional nonlinear unitary operations, featuring norm-preserving mappings with nonconservative inner products, which enables the construction of high-dimensional nonlinear unitary circuits. Using deep nonlinear unitary circuits, we demonstrate exponential growth in trajectory length and near-complete coverage of the output space, both of which are essential for deep learning. Along with neuroevolutionary learning examples for the regression of a nonconvex function, our results pave the way to photonic neural networks with highly expressive inference and stable training.

Our analysis focuses on crystals formed through nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene. These perturbations, which can have arbitrary spatial variations, are generally described by scalar and vector fields. Using a tight-binding model, we consider the most general nonreciprocal interactions, including gyromagnetic, pseudo-Tellegen, and moving medium responses, and examine how the corresponding nonreciprocal fields influence the crystal's topology. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal interactions alone are insufficient to induce a topologically nontrivial phase. Instead, a nontrivial p6m component in the nonreciprocal fields is required to open a bandgap and achieve a non-zero Chern number. These results provide a symmetry-based roadmap for engineering photonic topological phases via nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene, offering practical guidelines for designing topological phases in graphene-like photonic crystals.

However, genuine protection against backscattering in photonics requires implementing architectures with broken time-reversal which is technically challenging. Here, we make use of a frequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platform to experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldane model where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states' geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results thus open the door to harnessing topologically protected unidirectional transport of light in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems.         ",

Fundamental thermal noise in the resonator material typically limits the timing and frequency stability of a microcomb. The small optical mode volume of the microresonators exaggerates this effect, as it both increases the magnitude and shortens the timescale of thermodynamic fluctuations. In this work, we investigate thermal instability in silicon nitride microring resonators as well as techniques for reducing their effects on the microcomb light. We characterize the time-dependent thermal response in silicon nitride microring resonators through experimental measurements and finite element method simulations. Through fast control of the pump laser frequency, we reduce thermal recoil due to heating. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of a coupled microresonator system with tunable mode interactions to stabilize a soliton pulse against thermal shifts.         ",

Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.

Here, through the lens of quantum optics, we study the scattering of electromagnetic fields from an isotropic and nondispersive material with a suddenly changing refractive index, creating a time interface. We revisit the transformation of the bosonic mode operators and corresponding quantum states due to this interface, governed by the two-mode squeeze operator. Building on this foundation, more importantly, our analysis focuses on the photon statistics and quantum state engineering of the scattered light, elucidating various quantum optical phenomena and opportunities arising from the time interface. Notably, these include photon-pair production and destruction, photon bunching and antibunching, vacuum generation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum state freezing.

For the calculations of linear optical absorption spectra, we employed both the first-principles time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), and the electron-correlated Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model coupled with the configuration-interaction (CI) approach. In the PPP-CI approach, calculations were performed using both screened and standard parameters, along with efficiently incorporating electron correlation effects using multi-reference singles-doubles configuration-interaction for both ground and excited states. We assume that the GQDs are saturated by hydrogen atoms at the edges, making them effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations. To further quantify the influence of electron-correlation effects, we also computed the singlet-triplet gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs, and we found them to be significant.         ",

We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data.

    "abstract": "           Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.         ",
