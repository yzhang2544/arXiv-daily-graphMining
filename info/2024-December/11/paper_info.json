    "title": "From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation I: Tracing the Brussels Group's Intellectual Journey",
    "abstract": "           The conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics proposes that quantum entities have a conceptual nature, interacting with the material world through processes that are the physical counterpart of the meaning-based processes which typically occur in human cognition. This interpretation emerged from the early developments in quantum cognition, a field that uses quantum mathematics to model human cognitive activity. It benefited from the specific approach taken by the Brussels research group, modeling concepts themselves as quantum entities and minds as measuring apparatuses. The article sketches the essential steps of the intellectual journey going from the first applications of quantum notions and formalisms to human cognition to the proposal of a potentially groundbreaking interpretation of quantum mechanics, offering profound explanations for major quantum phenomena. This was done by drawing numerous parallels with the human conceptual domain and suggesting the existence of a level of cognitive activity that would underlie our physical reality. This means that an increased cross-fertilization between the conceptuality interpretation and quantum cognition is to be expected in the future, both of which are synergistic in furthering our understanding of the nature of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article. In the second part, which can be read independently of the first, the successes of the interpretation will be described in a more systematic way, providing a brief overview of what has been achieved so far.

    "abstract": "           Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has recently emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, enabling the use of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for applications in quantum information processing, precision metrology, and ultrafast optical signal processing. However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.         ",

Through a series of resistance versus temperature measurements from room temperature to a few Kelvins, we explore the change in the conductive behavior of bismuth electrodeposited on various substrates at the various temperatures. Our findings show for the first time both hysteretic and irreversible changes in resistivity as a function of temperature. Further, magnetoresistance measurements reveal notable variations in resistance behavior under different magnetic fields, highlighting the impact of magnetic fields on these films' electronic transport properties, with an indication of potential weak anti-localization effects at the lowest temperatures. This study not only provides a deeper understanding of bismuth's conductivity characteristics at low temperatures but also sheds light on the practical implications for developing more effective TESs for synchrotron X-ray facilities.

These systems enable a high level of control over the sensor's center-of-mass motion, rotational degrees of freedom, and electric charge state. For many sensing applications, extending these techniques to arrays of sensors enables rejection of correlated noise sources and increases sensitivity to interactions that may be too rare or weak to detect with a single particle. Here we present techniques capable of trapping defect free, two-dimensional arrays of more than 25 microspheres in vacuum. These techniques provide independent control of the optical potential for each sphere. Simultaneous imaging of the motion of all spheres in the array is demonstrated using camera-based imaging, with optimized object tracking algorithms reaching a displacement sensitivity below 1 nm/$\\surd$Hz. Such arrays of levitated microspheres may find applications ranging from inertial sensing to searches for weakly interacting particles such as dark matter.         ",

Our theory is based on a multiple-scale approach applied to the Lugiato-Lefever equation, and provides a framework to investigate different pumping configurations. For multi-frequency pumping, we predict a progressively lower pumping threshold as the number of spectral windows increases due to an enhancement of the effective nonlinear parameter. However, multi-frequency pumping is not a prerequisite for the formation of these combs and can emerge even with a single driving field.

    "abstract": "           Nitrous oxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas. Its isotopic composition provides valuable insights into sources and sinks, and about the mechanism of formation. A major challenge in the spectroscopic analysis of the isotopocule compositions is the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters, particularly for the minor $^{15}$N isotopocules. In this work, we introduce high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of four isotopocules of nitrous oxide: $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO, $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO, and $^{15}$N$_{2}$O in the mid-infrared range of 3300 - 3550 cm$^{-1}$, using a frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer. The nitrous oxide samples were obtained from a chemical synthesis involving acid-catalyzed amine-borane reduction of equimolar amounts of $^{15}$N isotopically enriched sodium nitrite and $^{14}$N sodium nitrite. The high-resolution spectra, measured in a temperature-controlled single-pass absorption cell, were used to retrieve line center frequencies and relative intensities for a total of 426 rovibrational transitions of the ${\\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ band of the four isotopocules, and of the one order of magnitude weaker 2${\\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ and ${\\nu}$$_{1}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{2}$ + ${\\nu}$$_{3}$ - ${\\nu}$$_{2}$ bands in the same spectral region. We compare the determined line center frequencies and relative intensities with spectroscopic parameters available in high-resolution molecular databases. For $^{14}$N$_{2}$O, $^{14}$N$^{15}$NO and $^{15}$N$^{14}$NO we find good agreement with the HITRAN database. The $^{15}$N$_{2}$O isotopocule is missing in HITRAN, and we find that its line center frequencies in the GEISA database, the Institute of Atmospheric Optics database, as well as the Ames-1 line list deviate severely from the comb measurements.

It is shown that, regardless of the specific type of atomic potential and the model dimensionality, there is a set of laser frequencies, at which the harmonic generation efficiency increases dramatically with a simultaneous increase of their ellipticity. In these cases, the harmonic ellipticity can exceed the laser ellipticity by 2 or more times in absolute value. It is shown that the efficiency of harmonic generation in this interaction regime depends weakly or almost does not depend on the laser ellipticity. The pathways leading to resonant emission of intense harmonics with increased ellipticities are identified. The enhancement of the ellipticity of these harmonics is explained in terms of relative probabilities of resonant transitions in an elliptically polarized laser field for different values of the magnetic quantum number.

Further, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. Additionally, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute.

Here, using the polarization-dependent longitudinal and transverse optical beam shift as a platform, we experimentally realize the quantum joint weak measurement in a classical optical setting. Polarization states are cleverly pre and post-selected, and different single and joint canonical position-momentum observables of the beam are experimentally extracted and subsequently analyzed for successful detection of complex joint weak value.

    "abstract": "           An integral procedure in every coherent multidimensional spectroscopy experiment is to suppress undesired background signals. For that purpose, one can employ a particular phase-matching geometry or phase cycling, a procedure that was adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In optical multidimensional spectroscopy, phase cycling has been usually carried out in a \"nested\" fashion, where pulse phases are incremented sequentially with linearly spaced increments. Another phase-cycling approach which was developed for NMR spectroscopy is \"cogwheel phase cycling,\" where all pulse phases are varied simultaneously in increments defined by so-called \"winding numbers\". Here we explore the concept of cogwheel phase cycling in the context of population-based coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. We derive selection rules for resolving and extracting fourth-order and higher-order nonlinear signals by cogwheel phase cycling and describe how to perform a numerical search for the winding numbers for various population-detected 2D spectroscopy experiments. We also provide an expression for a numerical search for nested phase-cycling schemes and predict the most economical schemes of both approaches for a wide range of nonlinear signals. The signal selectivity of the technique is demonstrated experimentally by acquiring rephasing and nonrephasing fourth-order signals of a laser dye by both phase-cycling approaches. We find that individual nonlinear signal contributions are, in most cases, captured with fewer steps by cogwheel phase cycling compared to nested phase cycling.         ",

Traditional methods, such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), scale exponentially with system size, while alternative methods like the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale more favorably, yet remain limited for large systems. In this work, we demonstrate how a simple machine learning model can enhance quantum chemical DMRG calculations, improving their accuracy to chemical precision, even for systems that would otherwise require considerably higher computational resources.

With an ever-increasing deployment density of coherent systems, the demand for highly integrated WDM coherent transceivers has been rising. While tremendous progress has been made on silicon photonics compatible high-speed modulation and photodetection on chip, a solution for monolithically integrable amplifier with high gain and output power remains a challenge. Recently, an erbium doped waveguide amplifier based on ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides has demonstrated gain and output power levels potentially suitable for Terabit class coherent communications. Here, we demonstrate a WDM coherent system enabled by this integrated photonic amplification solution. The system uses the waveguide amplifier as a booster amplifier of 16 WDM signals each carrying a net data rate of 1.6 Tb/s, achieving 25.6-Tb/s net capacity over 81-km fiber transmission. Our results highlight a fully integrated solution for highly parallel coherent transceivers including amplification, that has the potential to transform future optical communications.         ",

Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.

    "abstract": "           Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder model-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAE achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.

GenAI4UQ leverages a generative artificial intelligence (AI) based conditional modeling framework to address the limitations of traditional inverse modeling techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. By replacing computationally intensive iterative processes with a direct, learned mapping, GenAI4UQ enables efficient calibration of model input parameters and generation of output predictions directly from observations. The software's design allows for rapid ensemble forecasting with robust uncertainty quantification, while maintaining high computational and storage efficiency. GenAI4UQ simplifies the model training process through built-in auto-tuning of hyperparameters, making it accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. Its conditional generative framework ensures versatility, enabling applicability across a wide range of scientific domains. At its core, GenAI4UQ transforms the paradigm of inverse modeling by providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution.

    "abstract": "           Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is one of the most promising approaches for quantum chemical calculations with the current pre-fault tolerant quantum computers. In the conventional QSCI, the Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, the preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to compute total energies accurately. In this work, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty. In the HSB-QSCI, the Slater determinants are sampled from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the spin-singlet ground state and the first excited spin-triplet state of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecules; these results reveal that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems with multiconfigurational characteristics (i.e., the case where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard). We have also numerically confirmed that the HSB-QSCI is robust to approximation errors of the Hamiltonian simulation, such as Trotter errors and the truncation errors of Hamiltonian term by maximum locality in the localized molecular orbital basis. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for the hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecule using 20 qubits IBM superconducting device. The differences between the HSB-QSCI energy and the CAS-CI value are at most 0.15 kcal mol$^{-1}$, achieving chemical precision.         ",

Such features are essential to enable emerging THz applications, including 6G wireless communications, quantum information, bioimaging and security. However, the overall performance of these photodetectors may be utterly compromised by the impact of internal resistances presented in the device, so-called access or parasitic resistances. In this work, we provide a detailed study of the influence of internal device resistances in the photoresponse of high-mobility dual-gate GFET detectors. Such dual-gate architectures allow us to fine tune (decrease) the internal resistance of the device by an order of magnitude and consequently demonstrate an improved responsivity and noise-equivalent-power values of the photodetector, respectively. Our results can be well understood by a series resistance model, as shown by the excellent agreement found between the experimental data and theoretical calculations. These findings are therefore relevant to understand and improve the overall performance of existing high-mobility graphene photodetectors.         ",

    "abstract": "           We develop a new theoretical framework for exploring a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a highly correlated bath of bosons in the quantum critical regime of a Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) quantum phase transition. Our framework is based on a powerful quantum Gutzwiller (QGW) description of the bosonic bath combined with diagrammatic field theory for the impurity-bath interactions. By resumming a selected class of diagrams to infinite order, a rich picture emerges where the impurity is dressed by the fundamental modes of the bath, which change character from gapped particle-hole excitations in the MI to Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes in the SF. This gives rise to the existence of several quasiparticle (polaron) branches with properties reflecting the strongly correlated environment. In particular, one polaron branch exhibits a sharp cusp in its energy, while a new ground-state polaron emerges at the $O(2)$ quantum phase transition point for integer filling, which reflects the nonanalytic behavior at the transition and the appearance of the Goldstone mode in the SF phase. Smooth versions of these features are inherited in the polaron spectrum away from integer filling because of the varying ``Mottness\" of the bosonic bath. We furthermore compare our diagrammatic results with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, obtaining excellent agreement. This accuracy is quite remarkable for such a highly non-trivial case of strong interactions between the impurity and bosons in a maximally correlated quantum critical regime, and it establishes the utility of our framework. Finally, our results show how impurities can be used as quantum sensors and highlight fundamental differences between experiments performed at a fixed particle number or a fixed chemical potential.

    "abstract": "           The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.         ",

    "abstract": "           Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant nodeless fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-$\\mu$m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between ~-30 dB and ~-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at ~-60 dB at the 2-$\\mu$m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 $\\mu$m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.

    "title": "Brewster solitons and omnidirectional solitons in one-dimensional optical structures involving Kerr-type nonlinear materials",
    "abstract": "           The possibility of exciting stationary solitons due to the Brewster effect is investigated. The analysis is performed by computing the transmission coefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the optical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric polarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two different optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is assumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a linear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary solitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster phenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single Kerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton states within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the intensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the excitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers is discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission states, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that causes the homogenization of the electric permittivity.

    "abstract": "           We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate, we drive the gas isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size, and observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution. At lengthscales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we reveal the complete qualitative picture of how the steady-state cascade forms.         ",
