The shaped charge jet analogue comprises a conical copper liner, high explosive (HE), and silicone buffer. We apply a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal buffer design that can be placed between the liner and the HE that results in the largest possible change in jet velocity. The use of a genetic algorithm allows for discoveries of unintuitive, complex, yet optimal buffer designs. Experiments using the optimal design verified the effectiveness of the buffer and validated the modeling. ",

    "abstract": "The efficient generation of spin currents and spin torques via spin-orbit coupling is an important goal of spintronics research. One crucial metric for spin current generation is the spin Hall angle, which is the ratio of the spin Hall current to the transversely flowing charge current. A typical approach to measure the spin Hall angle in nonmagnetic materials is to generate spin currents via spin pumping in an adjacent ferromagnetic layer and measure the transverse voltage from the inverse spin Hall effect in the nonmagnetic layer. However, given that the spin Hall effect also occurs in ferromagnets, single ferromagnetic layers could generate a self-induced transverse voltage during spin pumping as well. Here we show that manganite based La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) films deposited by pulsed laser deposition exhibit a significant self-induced inverse spin Hall voltage while undergoing spin pumping. We observe efficient spin to charge conversion in the LSMO films via the inverse spin Hall effect. A spin pumping voltage of 1.86 $\\mu$V is observed in the LSMO (12 nm) film. Using density functional theory and the Kubo formalism, we calculate the intrinsic spin current conductivities of these films and show that they are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements.

    "abstract": "Tunable optical materials are indispensable elements in modern optoelectronics, especially in integrated photonics circuits where precise control over the effective refractive index is essential for diverse applications. Two-dimensional materials like Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene exhibit remarkable optical responses to external stimuli. However, achieving distinctive modulation across a broad spectrum while enabling precise phase control at low signal loss within a compact footprint remains an ongoing challenge. In this work, we unveil the robust electro-refractive response of multilayer ferroionic two-dimensional CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) in the near-infrared wavelength range. By integrating CuCrP2S6 into SiPh microring resonators (MRR), we enhance light-matter interaction and measurement sensitivity to minute phase and absorption variations. Results show that electrically driven Cu ions can tune the effective refractive index on the order of 2.8 x10-3 RIU (refractive index unit) while preserving extinction ratios and resonance linewidth. Notably, these devices exhibit low optical losses of 2.7 dB/cm and excellent modulation efficiency of 0.25 V.cm with a consistent blue shift in the resonance wavelengths among all devices. These results outperform earlier findings on phase shifter based on TMDs. Consequently, CCPS integration endows characteristics akin to those of high-index active dielectric materials. Moreover, we showcase the electro-optic tuning sensitivity to light polarization, opening avenues for versatile light manipulation. The dual optoelectronic and ionotronic capabilities of the two-terminal CCPS devices hold vast potential, spanning applications such as phased arrays, optical switching, and neuromorphic systems in light-sensitive artificial synapses.

This provides a basis for designing travelling slow-wave structures with a broadband interaction between relativistic charged particle beams and propagating terahertz waves allowing an energy exchange between beam and wave, amplifying terahertz radiation. We employ Fourier-Mathieu expansion, which gives approximate analytic solutions to Maxwell equations in a corrugated waveguide with periodically undulating cross-section. Being analytic, this enables quick design of corrugated waveguides, determined from desirable dispersion relations. We design a three dimensional waveguide with the desired dispersion and confirm the analytical predictions of the wave profile, using numerical simulations.

There are several models that describe the optical scattering of an incident field by the tip near a surface, and these models have been successful in relating the measured scattering signal to the dielectric function of the sample under the tip. Here, we address a situation that is normally not considered in the existing interaction models, namely the near-field signal arising from thin, highly conductive films in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. According to established theoretical models, highly conductive thin films should show insignificant contrast in the THz range for small variations in conductivity, therefore hindering the use of s-SNOM for nanoscale characterisation. We experimentally demonstrate unexpected but clear and quantifiable layer contrast in the THz s-SNOM signal from few-layer exfoliated graphene as well as subtle nanoscale contrast variations within graphene layers. We use finite-element simulations to confirm that the observed contrast is described by the classical electromagnetics of the scattering mechanism, suggesting that the dipole models must be reformulated to correctly describe the interaction with conductive samples.

Selected isolated physical systems can maintain coherence and generate entanglement using well-controlled interactions. Chemical reactions, where bonds break and form, are highly dynamic quantum processes. A fundamental question is whether coherence can be preserved in chemical reactions and then harnessed to generate entangled products. Here we investigate this question by studying the 2KRb $\\rightarrow$ K$_2$ + Rb$_2$ reaction at 500 nK, focusing on the the nuclear spin degrees of freedom. We prepare the initial nuclear spins in KRb in an entangled state and characterize the preserved coherence in nuclear spin wavefunction after the reaction. The data are consistent with full coherence at the end of the reaction. This suggests that entanglement can be prepared within the reactants, followed by a chemical reaction that produces separate, entangled molecules. We additionally demonstrate control of the reaction product state distribution by deliberately decohering the reactants. ",

While linear photonic neural networks are within reach, photonic computing with large-scale optical nonlinear nodes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a large-scale, high-performance nonlinear photonic neural system based on a disordered polycrystalline slab composed of lithium niobate nanocrystals. Mediated by random quasi-phase-matching and multiple scattering, linear and nonlinear optical speckle features are generated as the interplay between the simultaneous linear random scattering and the second-harmonic generation, defining a complex neural network in which the second-order nonlinearity acts as internal nonlinear activation functions. Benchmarked against linear random projection, such nonlinear mapping embedded with rich physical computational operations shows improved performance across a large collection of machine learning tasks in image classification, regression, and graph classification with varying complexity. Demonstrating up to 27,648 input and 3,500 nonlinear output nodes, the combination of optical nonlinearity and random scattering serves as a scalable computing engine for diverse applications. ",

    "abstract": "We start with methodological analysis of the notion of scientific theory and its interrelation with reality. This analysis is based on the works of Helmholtz, Hertz, Boltzmann, and Schr\\\"odinger (and reviews of D' Agostino). Following Helmholtz, Hertz established the \"Bild concept\" for scientific theories. Here \"Bild\" (\"picture\") carries the meaning \"model\" (mathematical). The main aim of natural sciences is construction of the causal theoretical models (CTMs) of natural phenomena. Hertz claimed that CTM cannot be designed solely on the basis of observational data; it typically contains hidden quantities. Experimental data can be described by an observational model (OM), often on the price of acausality. CTM-OM interrelation can be tricky. Schr\\\"odinger used the Bild concept to create CTM for quantum mechanics (QM) and QM was treated as OM. We follow him and suggest a special CTM for QM, so-called prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT). The common interpretation of the violation of the Bell inequality is criticized from the perspective of the two level structuring of scientific theories. Such critical analysis of von Neumann and Bell no-go theorems for hidden variables was performed already by De Broglie (and Lochak) in 1970s. The Bild-approach is applied to the two level CTM-OM modeling of Brownian motion: the overdamped regime corresponds to OM. We briefly discuss ontic-epistemic structuring of scientific theories (Primas-Atmanspacher) and its relation to the Bild concept. ",

Generally, quantum probes like entangled states or squeezing states are considered essential for enhancing the precision limit in quantum parameter estimation. However, there has been little focus on the incorporation of quantum properties into the parameterizing dynamical processes. In this work, we develop a parameterizing dynamics with an indefinite time direction for quantum parameter estimation. Leveraging this quantum properties of the parameterizing dynamics allows us to maximize the available resources in the evolving process. As a result, our scheme is capable of achieving Heisenberg-scaling enhancement in precision limit. For demonstration, we apply this strategy to maximize the utilization of OAM resources for measuring the angular rotations of beam profile. This enables a precision enhancement following the same power law of Heisenberg scaling. Notably, a nrad-scale precision of the angular rotation measurement is finally achieved in the experiment. ",

    "title": "The Quantum Transition of the Two-Dimensional Ising Spin Glass: A Tale  of Two Gaps",
    "abstract": "Quantum annealers are commercial devices aiming to solve very hard computational problems named spin glasses. Just like in metallurgic annealing one slowly cools a ferrous metal, quantum annealers seek good solutions by slowly removing the transverse magnetic field at the lowest possible temperature. The field removal diminishes quantum fluctuations but forces the system to traverse the critical point that separates the disordered phase (at large fields) from the spin-glass phase (at small fields). A full understanding of this phase transition is still missing. A debated, crucial question regards the closing of the energy gap separating the ground state from the first excited state. All hopes of achieving an exponential speed-up, as compared to classical computers, rest on the assumption that the gap will close algebraically with the number of qspins, but renormalization group calculations predict that the closing will be instead exponential. Here we solve this debate through extreme-scale numerical simulations, finding that both parties grasped parts of the truth. While the closing of the gap at the critical point is indeed super-algebraic, it remains algebraic if one restricts the symmetry of possible excitations. Since this symmetry restriction is experimentally achievable (at least nominally), there is still hope for the Quantum Annealing paradigm. ",

    "title": "Variational quantum eigensolver for closed-shell molecules with  non-bosonic corrections",
    "abstract": "The realization of quantum advantage with noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines has become one of the major challenges in computational sciences. Maintaining coherence of a physical system with more than ten qubits is a critical challenge that motivates research on compact system representations to reduce algorithm complexity. Toward this end, quantum simulations based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is considered to be one of the most promising algorithms for quantum chemistry in the NISQ era. We investigate reduced mapping of one spatial orbital to a single qubit to analyze the ground state energy in a way that the Pauli operators of qubits are mapped to the creation/annihilation of singlet pairs of electrons. To include the effect of non-bosonic (or non-paired) excitations, we introduce a simple correction scheme in the electron correlation model approximated by the geometrical mean of the bosonic (or paired) terms. Employing it in a VQE algorithm, we assess ground state energies of H2O, N2, and Li2O in good agreements with full configuration interaction (FCI) models respectively, using only 6, 8, and 12 qubits with quantum gate depths proportional to the squares of the qubit counts. We also investigate the potential energy profile along the CH2OH+ -> HCO+ + H2 decomposition reaction. With the adopted seniority-zero approximation that uses only one half of the qubit counts of a conventional VQE algorithm, we find our non-bosonic correction method reaches reliable quantum chemistry simulations at least for the tested systems.
