    "abstract": "The unique benefits of Fabry-P\\'erot resonators as frequency-stable reference cavities and as an efficient interface between atoms and photons make them an indispensable resource for emerging photonic technologies. To bring these performance benefits to next-generation communications, computation, and timekeeping systems, it will be necessary to develop strategies to integrate compact Fabry-P\\'erot resonators with photonic integrated circuits. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel reflection cancellation circuit that utilizes a numerically optimized multi-port polarization-splitting grating coupler to efficiently interface high-finesse Fabry-P\\'erot resonators with a silicon photonic circuit. This circuit interface produces spatial separation of the incident and reflected waves, as required for on-chip Pound-Drever-Hall frequency locking, while also suppressing unwanted back reflections from the Fabry-P\\'erot resonator. Using inverse design principles, we design and fabricate a polarization-splitting grating coupler that achieves 55% coupling efficiency. This design realizes an insertion loss of 5.8 dB for the circuit interface and more than 9 dB of back reflection suppression, and we demonstrate the versatility of this system by using it to interface several reflective off-chip devices.

    "abstract": "We extend the classical magnetohydrodynamics formalism to include nonlocal quantum behavior via the phenomenological Bohm potential. We then solve the quantum magnetohydrodynamics equations to obtain a new analytical form of the dynamic structure factor (DSF), a fundamental quantity linking theory and experiments. Our results show that the three-peak structure -- one central Rayleigh peak and two Brillouin peaks -- of the DSF arising from quantum hydrodynamic fluctuations becomes (in general) a five-peak structure -- one central Rayleigh peak and two pairs of peaks associated with fast and slow magnetosonic waves. The Bohm contribution influences the positions and characteristics (height, width, and intensity) of the peaks by introducing three significant modifications: (a) an increase in effective thermal pressure, (b) a reduction in the adiabatic index, and (c) an enhancement of effective thermal diffusivity. The multiple DSF peaks enable concurrent measurements of diverse plasma properties, transport coefficients, and thermodynamic parameters in magnetized dense plasmas. The potential for experimental validation of our theory looms large, particularly through future experiments conducted at state-of-the-art laser facilities. ",

    "abstract": "Electrolyte solutions play a pivotal role throughout chemistry and biology. For over a century, scientists have therefore sought to accumulate a precise knowledge and understanding of their thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural properties. However, the vast majority of electrolyte properties have not or cannot be determined empirically, despite being key to understanding a huge range of biological and chemical processes and systems. In this work, we introduce a long-sought-after solution to this problem and employ it to develop a detailed understanding of an electrolyte solution: aqueous lithium chloride. Our solution draws from recent breakthroughs in machine learning, first principles quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics and lets us develop and run truly predictive all-atom and coarse-grained simulations using long-range corrected equivariant neural network potentials (NNP). Surprisingly, our calculations reveal the formation of Li cation dimers. This previously unknown species highlights the power of the approach to divulge new understanding of electrolytes. Key electrolyte properties, including activity and diffusion coefficients, are determined from first principles and validated in close agreement with experiment. The training data is a small set (655 frames) of moderate-cost density corrected density functional theory (DC-DFT) calculations, meaning the approach can be scaled to build a database of electrolyte solution properties.

With a single-sided conical fiber taper, we demonstrate efficient coupling to an on-chip photonic bus waveguide in a liquid environment. We then show that it is possible to replace such on-chip bus waveguide by two joined conical fibers in order to directly couple light into a target whispering gallery disk resonator. This latter approach proves compliant with demanding environments, such as a vibrating pulse tube cryostat operating at low temperature, and it is demonstrated both in the telecom band and in the near infrared close to 900 nm of wavelength. The versatility, stability, and high coupling efficiency of this method are promising for quantum optics and sensing experiments in constrained environments, where obtaining high signal-to-noise ratio remains a challenge.

    "abstract": "Chiral materials display a property called optical activity, which is the capability to interact differentially with left and right circularly polarised light. This leads to the ability to manipulate the polarisation state of light, which has a broad range of applications spanning from energy efficient displays to quantum technologies. Both synthesised and engineered chiral nanomaterials are exploited in such devices. The design strategy for optimising the optical activity of a chiral material is typically based on maximising a single parameter, the electric dipole magnetic dipole response. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach of controlling optical activity by manipulating both the dipole and multipolar response of a nanomaterial. This provides an additional parameter for material design, affording greater flexibility. The exemplar systems used to illustrate the strategy are nanofabricated chiral silicon structures. The multipolar response of the structures, and hence their optical activity, can be controlled simply by varying their height. This phenomenon allows optical activity and the creation of so called superchiral fields, with enhanced asymmetries, to be controlled over a broader wavelength range, than is achievable with just the electric dipole magnetic dipole response. This work adds to the material design toolbox providing a route to novel nanomaterials for optoelectronics and sensing applications. ",

Essential to many of these applications is the control of the comb's defining parameters, i.e., carrier-envelope offset frequency and repetition rate. An elegant and all-optical approach to controlling both degrees of freedom is the suitable injection of a secondary continuous-wave laser into the resonator onto which one of the comb lines locks. Here, we study experimentally such sideband injection locking in microresonator soliton combs across a wide optical bandwidth and derive analytic scaling laws for the locking range and repetition rate control. As an application example, we demonstrate optical frequency division and repetition rate phase-noise reduction to three orders of magnitude below the noise of a free-running system. The presented results can guide the design of sideband injection-locked, parametrically generated frequency combs with opportunities for low-noise microwave generation, compact optical clocks with simplified locking schemes and more generally, all-optically stabilized frequency combs from Kerr-nonlinear resonators.

In this research, we introduce the concept of elastic metagrating and present the theoretical and experimental demonstration of locally resonant elastic metagrating (LREM). Remarkably, the LREM, with dimensions two orders of magnitude smaller than the relevant wavelength, overcomes the size limitations of conventional metagratings and offers a unique design paradigm for highly efficient wave manipulation with an extremely compact structure in elastic wave systems. Based on a distinctive elastic impedance engineering with hybridization of intrinsic evanescent waves, the proposed LREM achieves wide-angle perfect absorption. This tackles a fundamental challenge faced by all elastic metastructures designed for wave manipulation, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their implementations in real-world applications.

However, the presence of multiple-scattering (MS) signals can degrade the quantitative polarization measurement accuracy. We demonstrate a method to reduce MS signals and increase the measurement accuracy of Jones matrix PS-OCT. This method suppresses MS signals by averaging of multiple Jones matrix volumes measured using different focal positions. The MS signals are decorrelated among the volumes by focus position modulation and are thus reduced by averaging. However, the single scattering signals are kept consistent among the focus-modulated volumes by computational refocusing. We validated the proposed method using a scattering phantom and a postmortem medaka fish. The results showed reduced artifacts in birefringence and degree-of-polarization uniformity measurements, particularly in deeper regions in the samples. This method offers a practical solution to mitigate MS-induced artifacts in PS-OCT imaging and improves quantitative polarization measurement accuracy. ",

We observe intense SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under hole-capture, measure the intrinsic conversion time from the dark SiV$^{2-}$ to the bright SiV$^-$ to be 36.4(6.7)ms and demonstrate how it can be enhanced by a factor of $10^5$ via optical pumping. Moreover, we obtain new information on the defects that contribute to photo-conductivity, indicating the presence of substitutional nitrogen and divacancies. ",

We apply it to the accurate numerical study of acoustic radiation in the neighborhood of a sound-hard two-dimensional staircase modeled after the El Castillo pyramid. Such staircases support trapped waves which travel along the surface and decay exponentially away from it. We use the array scanning method (Floquet--Bloch transform) to recover the scattered field as an integral over the family of quasiperiodic solutions parameterized by their on-surface wavenumber. Each such BIE solution requires the quasiperiodic Green's function, which we evaluate using an efficient integral representation of lattice sum coefficients. We avoid the singularities and branch cuts present in the array scanning integral by complex contour deformation. For each frequency, this enables a solution accurate to around 10 digits in a couple of seconds. We propose a residue method to extract the limiting powers carried by trapped modes far from the source. Finally, by computing the trapped mode dispersion relation, we use a simple ray model to explain an observed acoustic \"raindrop\" effect (chirp-like time-domain response). ",

TERS capability of reflecting spin states in open-shell molecular configurations is yet unexplored. Here we use the tip of a scanning probe microscope to lift a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecule from a metal surface to bring it into an open-shell spin one-half anionic state. We reveal a correlation between the appearance of a Kondo resonance in the differential conductance spectroscopy and concurrent characteristic changes captured by the TERS measurements. Through a detailed investigation of various adsorbed and tip-contacted PTCDA scenarios, we infer that the Raman scattering on the suspended PTCDA is resonant with a higher excited state. Theoretical simulation of the vibrational spectra enables a precise assignment of the individual TERS peaks to high-symmetry Ag modes, including the fingerprints of the observed spin state. These findings highlight the potential of TERS in capturing complex interactions between charge, spin, and photophysical properties in nanoscale molecular systems, and suggest a pathway for designing spin-optical devices using organic molecules.

    "abstract": "The central topic of this letter is to show that light-matter hybridization not only gives rise to novel dynamic responses but can also modify intermolecular interactions and induce new structural order. Using the van der Waals (vdW) system in an optical cavity as an example, we predict the effects of interference and collectivity in cavity-induced many-body dispersion interactions. Specifically, the leading order correction due to cavity-induced quantum fluctuations leads to 3-body and 4-body vdW interactions, which can align intermolecular vectors and are not pairwise additive. In addition, the cavity-induced dipole leads to a single-molecule energy shift that aligns individual molecules, and a pair-wise interaction that scales as $R^{-3}$ instead of the standard $R^{-6}$ distance scaling. The coefficients of all these cavity-induced corrections depend on the cavity frequency and are renormalized by the effective Rabi frequency, which in turn depends on the particle density. Finally, we study the interaction of the vdW system in a cavity with an external object and find a significant enhancement in the interaction range due to modified distance scaling laws. These theoretical predictions suggest the possibility of cavity-induced nematic or smectic order and may provide an essential clue to understanding intriguing phenomena observed in optical cavities, such as strongly-modified ground-state reactivity, ion transport and solvent polarity.
