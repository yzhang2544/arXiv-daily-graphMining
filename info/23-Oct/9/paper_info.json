    "abstract": "In this study, we utilize the many-body expansion (MBE) framework to decompose electronic structures into fragments by incrementing the virtual orbitals. Our work aims to accurately solve the ground and excited state energies of each fragment using the variational quantum eigensolver and deflation algorithms. Although our approach is primarily based on unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) and a generalization thereof, we also introduce modifications and approximations to conserve quantum resources in MBE by partially generalizing the UCCSD operator and neglecting the relaxation of the reference states. As a proof of concept, we investigate the potential energy surfaces for the bond-breaking processes of the ground state of two molecules ($\\rm H_2O$ and $\\rm N_2$) and calculate the ground and excited state energies of three molecules (LiH, CH$^+$, and $\\rm H_2O$). The results demonstrate that our approach can, in principle, provide reliable descriptions in all tests, including strongly correlated systems, when appropriate approximations are chosen. Additionally, we perform model simulations to investigate the impact of shot noise on the total MBE energy and show that precise energy estimation is crucial for lower-order MBE fragments. ",

    "abstract": "The performance of a wavelet-based optical flow velocimetry (wOFV) algorithm to extract high accuracy and high resolution velocity fields from particle images in wall-bounded turbulent flows is assessed. wOFV is first evaluated using synthetic particle images generated from a channel flow DNS of a turbulent boundary layer. The sensitivity of wOFV to the regularization parameter (lambda) is quantified and results are compared to PIV. Results on synthetic particle images indicated different sensitivity to under-regularization or over-regularization depending on which region of the boundary layer is analyzed. Synthetic data revealed that wOFV can modestly outperform PIV in vector accuracy across a broad lambda range. wOFV showed clear advantages over PIV in resolving the viscous sublayer and obtaining highly accurate estimates of the wall shear stress. wOFV was also applied to experimental data of a developing turbulent boundary layer. Overall, wOFV revealed good agreement with both PIV and PIV + PTV. However, wOFV was able to successfully resolve the wall shear stress and correctly normalize the boundary layer streamwise velocity to wall units where PIV and PIV + PTV showed larger deviations. Analysis of the turbulent velocity fluctuations revealed spurious results for PIV in close proximity to the wall, leading to significantly exaggerated and non-physical turbulence intensity. PIV + PTV showed a minor improvement in this aspect. wOFV did not exhibit this same effect, revealing that it is more accurate in capturing small-scale turbulent motion in the vicinity of boundaries. The enhanced vector resolution of wOFV enabled improved estimation of instantaneous derivative quantities and intricate flow structure both closer to the wall. These aspects show that, within a reasonable lambda range, wOFV can improve resolving the turbulent motion occurring in the vicinity of physical boundaries. ",

    "abstract": "A novel room temperature capacitive transducer is described, which offers unparalleled signal to noise ratio for detecting small relative changes in capacitance, outperforming the best capacitance bridges. The transducer uses a simple resonant circuit, fashioned from a discrete inductor with small dissipation resonating with the capacitor acting as the sensor, to obtain a relative resolution equal or better than 10-11 in a 1 Hz bandwidth. When used as a mechanical displacement transducer, the predicted position noise is about 3 femtometre per rootHz. The circuit measures the change in capacitance by detecting the corresponding phase modulation at the resonance frequency and is configured to act as a close approximation of an all-pass filter to minimise the effects of amplitude modulation in case the drive signal is imperfectly tuned to the resonance. Some other applications of the proposed circuit are possible such as measuring electric field, where the sensing capacitor depends on the applied electric field. Also, the circuit can be easily adapted to function with very small capacitance values (1 - 2 pF) as is typical in MEMS based transducers. ",

    "abstract": "While dark transitions made bright by molecular motions determine the optoelectronic properties of many materials, simulating such non-Condon effects in condensed-phase spectroscopy remains a fundamental challenge. We derive a Gaussian theory to predict and analyze condensed phase optical spectra beyond the Condon limit. Our theory introduces novel quantities that encode how nuclear motions modulate the energy gap and transition dipole of electronic transitions in the form of spectral densities. By formulating the theory through a statistical framework of thermal averages and fluctuations, we circumvent the limitations of widely used microscopically harmonic theories, allowing us to tackle systems with generally anharmonic atomistic interactions and non-Condon fluctuations of arbitrary strength. We show how to calculate these spectral densities using first-principles simulations, capturing realistic molecular interactions and incorporating finite-temperature, disorder, and dynamical effects. Our theory accurately predicts the spectra of systems known to exhibit strong non-Condon effects (phenolate in various solvents) and reveals distinct mechanisms for electronic peak splitting: timescale separation of modes that tune non-Condon effects and spectral interference from correlated energy gap and transition dipole fluctuations. We further introduce analysis tools to identify how intramolecular vibrations, solute-solvent interactions, and environmental polarization effects impact dark transitions. Moreover, we prove an upper bound on the strength of cross correlated energy gap and transition dipole fluctuations thereby elucidating a simple condition that a system must follow for our theory to accurately predict its spectrum.

    "abstract": "Battery health assessment and recuperation play a crucial role in the utilization of second-life Li-ion batteries. However, due to ambiguous aging mechanisms and lack of correlations between the recovery effects and operational states, it is challenging to accurately estimate battery health and devise a clear strategy for cell rejuvenation. This paper presents aging and reconditioning experiments of 62 commercial high-energy type lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, which supplement existing datasets of high-power LFP cells. The relatively large-scale data allow us to use machine learning models to predict cycle life and identify important indicators of recoverable capacity. Considering cell-to-cell inconsistencies, an average test error of $16.84\\% \\pm 1.87\\%$ (mean absolute percentage error) for cycle life prediction is achieved by gradient boosting regressor given information from the first 80 cycles. In addition, it is found that some of the recoverable lost capacity is attributed to the lateral lithium non-uniformity within the electrodes. An equivalent circuit model is built and experimentally validated to demonstrate how such non-uniformity can be accumulated, and how it can give rise to recoverable capacity loss. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis also reveals that battery operation history significantly affects the capacity recovery. ",

    "abstract": "Efficient simulation of quantum circuits has become indispensable with the rapid development of quantum hardware. The primary simulation methods are based on state vectors and tensor networks. As the number of qubits and quantum gates grows larger in current quantum devices, traditional state-vector based quantum circuit simulation methods prove inadequate due to the overwhelming size of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement. Consequently, brutal force tensor network simulation algorithms become the only viable solution in such scenarios. The two main challenges faced in tensor network simulation algorithms are optimal contraction path finding and efficient execution on modern computing devices, with the latter determines the actual efficiency. In this study, we investigate the optimization of such tensor network simulations on modern GPUs and propose general optimization strategies from two aspects: computational efficiency and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to transform critical Einstein summation operations into GEMM operations, leveraging the specific features of tensor network simulations to amplify the efficiency of GPUs. Secondly, by analyzing the data characteristics of quantum circuits, we employ extended precision to ensure the accuracy of simulation results and mixed precision to fully exploit the potential of GPUs, resulting in faster and more precise simulations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 3.96x reduction in verification time for random quantum circuit samples in the 18-cycle case of Sycamore, with sustained performance exceeding 21 TFLOPS on one A100. This method can be easily extended to the 20-cycle case, maintaining the same performance, accelerating by 12.5x compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based results and 4.48-6.78x compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based results reported in the literature.

Additionally, unlike collapse theories, in principle, arbitrary systems can be placed in a superposition for an arbitrary amount of time. Furthermore, it provides a series of novel empirical posits that may distinguish it from other quantum theories. According to EnDQT, certain systems acquire determinate values at some point in time, and the capacity to give rise to determinate values through interactions propagates to other systems in spacetime via local interactions. This process can be represented via certain networks. When there is isolation from the rest of the systems that belong to these networks, such as inside the friend's isolated lab in the extended Wigner's friend scenarios, indeterminate values non-relationally arise inside.

Of particular prominence are autoregressive neural quantum states (ANQS), which enjoy the expressibility of deep neural networks, and are equipped with a procedure for fast and unbiased sampling. Yet, the non-selective nature of autoregressive sampling makes incorporating quantum number symmetries challenging. In this work, we develop a general framework to make the autoregressive sampling compliant with an arbitrary number of quantum number symmetries. We showcase its advantages by running electronic structure calculations for a range of molecules with multiple symmetries of this kind. We reach the level of accuracy reported in previous works with more than an order of magnitude speedup and achieve chemical accuracy for all studied molecules, which is a milestone unreported so far. Combined with the existing effort to incorporate space symmetries, our approach expands the symmetry toolbox essential for any variational ansatz and brings the ANQS closer to being a competitive choice for studying challenging quantum many-body systems.
