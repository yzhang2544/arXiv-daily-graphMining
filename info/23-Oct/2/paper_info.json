    "abstract": "A relativistic version of the correspondence principle, a limit in which classical electrodynamics may be derived from QED, has never been clear, especially when including gravitational mass. Here we introduce a novel classical field theory formulation of electromagnetism, and then show that it approximates QED in the limit of a quantum state which corresponds to a classical charged continua. Our formulation of electromagnetism features a Lagrangian which is gauge invariant, includes a classical complex field from which a divergenceless four-current may be derived, and reproduces all aspects of the classical theory of charged massive continua without any quantum effects. Taking a geometric approach, we identify the four-current as being in the direction of extremal phase velocity of the classical field; the field equations of motion determine this phase velocity as being equal to the mass, which makes the rest density proportional to the squared modulus of the field.

    "abstract": "Optimizing shapes and topology of physical devices is crucial for both scientific and technological advancements, given its wide-ranging implications across numerous industries and research areas. Innovations in shape and topology optimization have been seen across a wide range of fields, notably structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, and photonics. Gradient-based inverse design techniques have been particularly successful for photonic and optical problems, resulting in integrated, miniaturized hardware that has set new standards in device performance. To calculate the gradients, there are typically two approaches: implementing specialized solvers using automatic differentiation or deriving analytical solutions for gradient calculation and adjoint sources by hand. In this work, we propose a middle ground and present a hybrid approach that leverages and enables the benefits of automatic differentiation and machine learning frameworks for handling gradient derivation while using existing, proven solvers for numerical solutions. Utilizing the adjoint method, we turn existing numerical solvers differentiable and seamlessly integrate them into an automatic differentiation framework. Further, this enables users to integrate the optimization environment with machine learning applications which could lead to better photonic design workflows. We illustrate the approach through two distinct examples: optimizing the Purcell factor of a magnetic dipole in the vicinity of an optical nanocavity and enhancing the light extraction efficiency of a {\\textmu}LED.

Despite this proposed variety, to date, only molecules with $^2\\Sigma$-type ground states have successfully been confined and cooled in magneto-optical traps. While none of the proposed $^1\\Sigma$-type molecules have been successfully laser cooled and trapped, they are expected to have various advantages in terms of exhibiting a lower chemical reactivity and an internal structure that benefits the cooling schemes. Here, we present the prospects and strategies for optical cycling in AlCl -- a $^1\\Sigma$ molecule -- and report on the first characterization of the $A^{1}\\Pi$ state hyperfine structure. Based on these results, we carry out detailed simulations on the expected capture velocity of a magneto-optical trap for AlCl.

    "abstract": "Many biological processes occur at high speeds in complex 3D environments, and developing imaging techniques capable of elucidating their dynamics is an outstanding challenge. One outstanding question is understanding the interactions of active swimmers with the local physics of their viscous 3D environment. Here, we address this challenge by developing a multiplexed quantitative phase imaging approach capable of recording the 3D refractive index at kilohertz rates. Specifically, we develop Fourier synthesis optical diffraction tomography (FS-ODT), a new pattern generation and inverse computational strategy for ODT. In FS-ODT, we multiplex tens of beam angles to expand the system field of view and increase the information in single images, thereby increasing the tomogram acquisition rate. We further show that FS-ODT can simultaneously multiplex beam angles and positions to synthesize a large field of view at kilohertz framerates. We verify FS-ODT performance by imaging samples of known composition and accurately recovering the refractive index for multiplexing conditions. We then demonstrate the capabilities of FS-ODT for imaging fast diffusing microspheres in solution and single-cellular bacterial swimmers. FS-ODT is a promising approach for unlocking challenging imaging regimes that have been little explored, including measuring 3D flow fields generated by microswimmers. ",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the flexible tunability of excitation transport in Rydberg atoms, under the interplay of controlled dissipation and interaction-induced synthetic flux. Considering a minimum four-site setup -- a triangular configuration with an additional output site -- we study the transport of a single excitation, injected into a vertex of the triangle, through the structure. While the long-range dipole-dipole interactions between the Rydberg atoms lead to geometry-dependent Peierls phases in the hopping amplitudes of excitations, we further introduce on-site dissipation to a vertex of the triangle. As a result, both the chirality and destination of the transport can be manipulated through the flux and dissipation. In particular, we illustrate a parameter regime where our Rydberg-ring structure may serve as a switch for transporting the injected excitation through to the output site. The underlying mechanism is then analyzed by studying the chiral trajectory of the excitation and the time-dependent dissipation. ",

In many of the envisaged applications open access to the molecules involved is vital, as is independent control over polariton dispersion, and spatial uniformity. Existing cavity designs are not able to offer all of these advantages simultaneously. Here we demonstrate an alternative yet simple cavity design that exhibits all of the the desired features. We hope the approach we offer here will provide a new technology platform to both study and exploit molecular strong coupling. Although our experimental demonstration is based on excitonic strong coupling, we also indicate how the approach might also be achieved for vibrational strong coupling. ",

In this work, we unequivocally demonstrate a master-slave type of synchronization between two self-sustained optomechanical crystal oscillators that interact solely through an external optical feedback stage. Several pieces of experimental evidence rule out the possibility of resonant forcing, and, in contrast to previous works, indicate that synchronization is achieved in the regime of natural dynamics suppression. Our experimental results are in agreement with the predictions of a numerical model describing the specific mechanical lasing dynamics of each oscillator and the unidirectional interaction between them. The outcomes of our study pave the way toward the synchronization of clock signals corresponding to far-placed processing elements in a future synchronous photonic integrated circuit. ",

In this work, using the example of $\\alpha-$MoO$_3$, we demonstrate that by constructing photonic hypercrystals of this material, one can not only excite these in-plane HPhPs in the far field but also tune the far field response via twisting the hypercrystal lattice with respect the lattice of $\\alpha-$MoO$_3$.

    "abstract": "In this work, we describe a procedure for synthesizing racetrack resonators with large quality factors and apply it to realize a multi-channel wavelength-selective switch (WSS) on a silicon photonic chip. We first determine the contribution of each component primitive to propagation loss in a racetrack resonator and use this data to develop a model for the frequency response of arbitrary order, coupled-racetrack channel dropping filters. We design second-order racetrack filters based on this model and cascade multiple such filters to form a 1x7 WSS. We find good agreement between our model and device performance with second-order racetrack that have ~1 dB of drop-port loss, ~2 GHz FWHM linewidth, and low optical crosstalk due to the quick filter roll-off of ~ 5.3 dB/GHz. Using a control algorithm, we show three-channel operation of our WSS with a channel spacing of only 10 GHz. Owing to the high quality factor and quick roll-off of our filter design, adjacent channel crosstalk is measured to be <-25 dB for channels spaced on a 10 GHz grid. As a further demonstration, we use five of seven WSS channels to perform a demultiplexing operation on both an 8 GHz and a 10 GHz grid. These results suggest that a low-loss WSS with fine channel resolution can be realized in a scalable manner using the silicon photonics platform. ",
