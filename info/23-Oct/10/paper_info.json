    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to determine the optical properties of materials in the nanoscale range using optical tweezers (OT). Fluorescent polymer-based nanostructures (pdots) are optically trapped in a Gaussian beam OT and the trap stiffness is studied as a function of various parameters of interest. We explicitly show that properties such as the refractive index and the optical anisotropy of these nanostructures can be determined with high accuracy by comparing the experimental data to an optical force model. In particular, we demonstrate that the effective optical properties of these pdots can be modulated by changing the light wavelength that excites the sample, opening the door for a fine tuning of their optical response, with possible applications in the development of new sensors and/or other optoelectronic devices.

    "abstract": "In classical mechanics, a particle cannot escape from an unbounded potential well. Naively, one would expect a similar result to hold in wave mechanics, since high barriers make tunneling difficult. However, this is not always the case and it is known that wave delocalization can arise in certain models with incommensurate unbounded potentials sustaining critical states, i.e. states neither fully extended nor fully localized. Here we introduce a different and broader class of unbounded potentials, which are not quasi-periodic and do not require any specially-tailored shape, where wave delocalization is observed. The results are illustrated by considering light dynamics in synthetic photonic lattices, which should provide a feasible platform for the experimental observation of wave delocalization in unbounded potentials.

    "abstract": "Here we present a new measurement method for the characterization of photonic integrated circuits (PIC) with an ultrahigh resolution, speed, and sensitivity that outperforms the existing PIC characterization methods. It is based on the heterodyne process and employs a tunable laser and a fixed-wavelength laser (termed sweeping optical heterodyne method, SOHO). By varying the wavelength of the tunable laser that is fed into the photonic microchip, the beat frequency is swept from DC to the GHz range. An outstanding advantage of this method is that it does not require any advanced components such as a narrow linewidth tunable laser or light modulator. Moreover, there is no need for an additional calibration procedure. We compared the performance of this method with the standard measurement method based on a tunable laser and a photodiode and achieved 100 times higher spectral resolution and 6 dB higher sensitivity. We further advanced this method to operate in real-time. The wavelength resolution of <40 fm is verified by measuring the spectrum of an unbalanced fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Finally, using this method, we characterized high-quality factor microring resonators that are realized in our new hybrid platform. This new measurement approach, which has superior performance parameters compared to existing methods, has the potential to become an essential characterization tool in integrated photonics. ",

This study takes advantage of the synergetic effects of tightly confined local fields of plasmonic nanoaperture, self-induced back-action of nanoparticles, and resonant optical trapping scheme to demonstrate enhanced manipulation of Janus nanoparticles in metallic nanohole aperture. We theoretically demonstrate that displacement of Au-coated Janus nanoparticles toward plasmonic nanoaperture and proper orientation of the metal coating give rise to enhanced near-field intensity and pronounced optical force. We also explore the effect of resonant optical trapping by employing two-laser system, where an on-resonant green laser excites the metal-coated nanoparticle whereas an off-resonant near-infrared laser plays trapping role. It is found that, at optimum nanoparticle configuration, the resonant optical trapping method can result in three-fold enhancement of optical force, which is attributed to excitation of surface plasmon resonance in Janus nanoparticles. These findings might have implications for efficient manipulation of light-absorbing nanoparticles of various compositions with low-power. ",

    "abstract": "With a growing demand for high-quality fabrication, the interest in real-time monitoring of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes has increased, leading manufacturers to incorporate a variety of online sensing methods including acoustic sensing, photodiode sensing, and high-speed imaging. However, real-time acquisition of high-resolution melt pool images in particular remains computationally demanding in practice due to the limitation of data caching and transfer. In this work, we present a new acoustic and thermal information-based monitoring approach that can infer critical melt pool morphological features in LPBF and represent them in image forms. We utilize wavelet scalogram matrices of acoustic and photodiode clip data to identify and predict highly time-resolved (within a 1.0 ms window) visual melt pool characteristics via a well-trained data-driven pipeline. With merely the acoustic and photodiode-collected thermal emission data as the input, the proposed pipeline enables data-driven inference and tracking of melt pool visual characteristics with an R-2 value of 0.8. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using an efficient and cost-effective method to facilitate online visual melt pool characterization, and we believe it can further contribute to the advances in quality control for LPBF.

Usually, this term is used for integrable models where solitons interact elastically. However, soliton turbulence can also be a part of non-integrable dynamics, where long-lasting solutions in the form of almost solitons may exist. In the present paper, the complex dynamics of ensembles of solitary waves is studied within the Schamel equation using direct numerical simulations. Some important statistical characteristics (distribution functions, moments) are calculated numerically for unipolar and bipolar soliton gases. Comparison of results with integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified KdV (mKdV) models are given qualitatively. Our results agree well with the predictions of the KdV equation in the case of unipolar solitons. However, in the bipolar case, we observed a notable departure from the mKdV model, particularly in the behavior of kurtosis. The observed increase in kurtosis signifies the amplification of distribution function tails, which, in turn, corresponds to the presence of high-amplitude waves. ",

For a single qubit model of H$_2$, we find that we are able to obtain energies within 4 millihartree (2.5 kcal/mol) of the exact energy along the entire potential energy curve, with the accuracy limited by both stochastic error and inconsistent performance of the IBM devices. We find that an optimization algorithm using direct inversion of the iterative subspace can converge swiftly, even to excited states, but stochastic noise can cause large parameter updates. For the four-site transverse-field Ising model at the critical point, PQE with an appropriate application of qubit tapering can recover 99% of the correlation energy, even discarding several parameters. The large number of CNOT gates needed for the additional parameters introduces a concomitant error that, on the IBM devices, results in loss of accuracy, despite the increased expressivity of the trial state. Error extrapolation techniques and tapering or postselection are recommended to mitigate errors in PQE hardware experiments. ",

THz phononic engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher temperatures. It can also enable new ways to manipulate and control thermal transport, as THz acoustic phonons are the main heat carriers in nonmetallic solids. Despite its potential, methods for engineering THz phonons have been little explored due to the challenges of achieving the required material control at sub-nanometer precision and efficient phonon coupling at THz frequencies. Here, we demonstrate efficient generation, detection, and manipulation of THz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We employ few-layer graphene as an ultrabroadband transducer, converting fs near-infrared pulses to broadband acoustic phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A single layer of WSe$_2$ is used as a sensor, where high-fidelity readout is enabled by the exciton-phonon coupling and strong light-matter interactions. By combining these capabilities in a single van der Waals heterostructure and detecting responses to incident mechanical waves, we performed THz phononic spectroscopy, similar to conventional optical spectroscopy which detects responses to incident electromagnetic waves. We demonstrate high-Q THz phononic cavities using hBN stacks. We further show that a single layer of WSe$_2$ embedded in hBN can efficiently block the transmission of THz phonons. By comparing our measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtain the important force constants at the heterointerfaces. Our results could enable THz phononic metamaterials based on van der Waals heterostructures, as well as novel routes for thermal engineering. ",
