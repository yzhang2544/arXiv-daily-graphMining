    "abstract": "III-V semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are near-ideal and versatile single-photon sources. Because of the capacity for monolithic integration with photonic structures as well as optoelectronic and optomechanical systems, they are proving useful in an increasingly broad application space. Here, we develop monolithic circular dielectric gratings on bulk substrates -- as opposed to suspended or wafer-bonded substrates -- for greatly improved photon collection from InAs quantum dots. The structures utilize a unique two-tiered distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structure for vertical electric field confinement over a broad angular range. Opposing ``openings\" in the cavities induce strongly polarized QD luminescence without harming collection efficiencies. We describe how measured enhancements depend critically on the choice of collection optics. This is important to consider when evaluating the performance of any photonic structure that concentrates farfield emission intensity. Our cavity designs are useful for integrating QDs with other quantum systems that require bulk substrates, such as surface acoustic wave phonons. ",

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are ubiquitously used for signal processing and filtering, as well as mechanical, chemical and biological sensing, and show promise as quantum transducers. However, nowadays most SAWs are excited and driven via electromechanical coupling and interdigital transducers (IDTs), limiting operation bandwidth and flexibility. Novel ways to coherently excite and detect SAWs all-optically interfaced with photonic integrated circuits are yet elusive. Backward Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) provides strong coherent interactions between optical and acoustic waves in chip-scale waveguides, however, demonstrations have been limited to single longitudinal waves in the waveguide core. Here, we numerically model and experimentally demonstrate surface acoustic wave stimulated Brillouin scattering (SAW-SBS) on a photonic chip. We designed and fabricated tailored waveguides made out of GeAsSe glass that show good overlap between SAWs at 3.81 GHz and guided optical modes, without requiring a top cladding. We measure a 225 W$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ Brillouin gain coefficient of the surface acoustic resonance and linewidth narrowing to 40 MHz. Experimentally accessing this new regime of stimulated Brillouin scattering opens the door for novel on-chip sensing and signal processing applications, strong Brillouin interactions in materials that do not provide sufficient acoustic guidance in the waveguide core as well as excitation of surface acoustic waves in non-piezoelectric materials.

    "abstract": "Chip-based terahertz devices are a versatile tool to manipulate and control millimeter-wave frequencies for integrated high-speed communication applications and related technologies in the context of sixth-generation (6G) wireless. However, there is a limited library of integrated functionalities, particularly for tailoring the emission and directivity of terahertz antennas, e.g., via frequency- and space-division multiplexing. Here we show that a simple silicon photonic crystal membrane provides a pathway for selectively suppressing, enhancing, directing, and re-directing frequencies between 0.3-0.5 THz. We develop a near-field emission and detection scheme to observe three distinct effects when an antenna is placed near a photonic crystal: (i) field suppression at frequencies corresponding to its quasi-TE bandgaps (ii) a previously unreported frequency-dependent directed emission from the point dipole along two distinct pathways for two neighboring frequencies, resulting in a local field concentration; (iii) a re-direction of the directed emission, achieved by rotating the photonic crystal with respect to the dipole orientation. Our simulations reveal that the observed behavior can be predicted from the underlying band structure. These results highlight the opportunities that photonic crystals can provide for alignment-free, chip-based 6G technologies. Our experimental technique will find use for characterizing the emission properties of true fabricated samples, whose inherent imperfections cannot realistically be accounted for by simulations, particularly in highly dispersive frequency bands.

    "abstract": "Resonant metasurfaces are of paramount importance in addressing the growing demand for reduced thickness and complexity, while ensuring high optical efficiency. This becomes particularly crucial in overcoming fabrication challenges associated with high aspect ratio structures, thereby enabling seamless integration of metasurfaces with electronic components at an advanced level. However, traditional design approaches relying on lookup tables and local field approximations often fail to achieve optimal performance, especially for nonlocal resonant metasurfaces. In this study, we investigate the use of statistical learning optimization techniques for nonlocal resonant metasurfaces, with a specific emphasis on the role of near-field coupling in wavefront shaping beyond single unit cell simulations. Our study achieves significant advancements in the design of resonant metasurfaces. For transmission-based metasurfaces, a beam steering design outperforms the classical design by achieving an impressive efficiency of 80\\% compared to the previous 23%. Additionally, our optimized extended depth-of-focus (EDOF) metalens yields a remarkable five-fold increase in focal depth, a four-fold enhancement in focusing power compared to conventional designs and an optical resolution superior to 600 cycle/mm across the focus region. Moreover, our study demonstrates remarkable performance with a wavelength-selected beam steering metagrating in reflection, achieving exceptional efficiency surpassing 85\\%. This far outperforms classical gradient phase distribution approaches, emphasizing the immense potential for groundbreaking applications in the field of resonant metasurfaces. ",

We found a phenomenon of the pronounced phase slippage of the inverse Faraday effect distribution when the pump wavelength is within the photonic band gap of the structure.

    "abstract": "Linear colour conversion is a process where an emitter absorbs a photon and then emits another photon with either higher or lower energy, corresponding to up- or down conversion, respectively. In this regard, the presence of a volumetric cavity plays a crucial role in enhancing absorption and photoluminescence (PL), as it allows for large volumes of interaction between the exciting photons and the emissive materials, maximising the colour conversion efficiency. Here, we present a dual resonance nanostructure made of a titanium dioxide (TiO2) subwavelength grating to enhance the colour down-conversion efficiency of green light at ~530 nm emitted by gradient alloyed CdxZn1-xSeyS1-y colloidal quantum dots (QDs) when excited with a blue light at ~460 nm. A large mode volume can be created within the QD layer by the hybridisation of the grating resonances and waveguide modes. This allows increasing mode overlap between the resonances and the QDs, resulting in large absorption and tailored emission enhancements. Particularly, we achieved polarized light emission with maximum photoluminescence enhancement of ~140 times at a specific angular direction, and a total enhancement of ~34 times within 0.55 numerical aperture (NA) of the collecting objective. The enhancement encompasses absorption enhancement, Purcell enhancement and directionality enhancement (i.e., outcoupling). We achieved total absorption of 35% for green QDs with a remarkably thin colour conversion layer of ~ 400 nm (inclusive of the TiO2 layer). This work provides a guideline for designing large-volume cavities for practical application in absorption/fluorescence enhancement, such as down colour conversion in microLED displays, detectors or photovoltaics.

Project 8 seeks to use the CRES technique to measure the neutrino mass with a sensitivity of 40~meV, requiring a large supply of tritium atoms stored in a multi-cubic meter detector volume. Antenna arrays are one potential technology compatible with an experiment of this scale, but the capability of an antenna-based CRES experiment to measure the neutrino mass depends on the efficiency of the signal detection algorithms. In this paper, we develop efficiency models for three signal detection algorithms and compare them using simulations from a prototype antenna-based CRES experiment as a case-study. The algorithms include a power threshold, a matched filter template bank, and a neural network based machine learning approach, which are analyzed in terms of their average detection efficiency and relative computational cost. It is found that significant improvements in detection efficiency and, therefore, neutrino mass sensitivity are achievable, with only a moderate increase in computation cost, by utilizing either the matched filter or machine learning approach in place of a power threshold, which is the baseline signal detection algorithm used in previous CRES experiments by Project 8.

Confined semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) offer additional handles to control the properties of excitons, for example, by changing the size or the shape of the NC, resulting in a mismatch between the excitonic gaps and the phonon frequencies. This has led to the hypothesis of a significant slowing down of exciton relaxation in strongly confined NC, but in practice due to increasing exciton--phonon coupling and rapid multiphonon relaxation channels, the relaxation of excitons depends only weakly on the size or shape of the NC. In this work, we focus on elucidating the nonradiative relaxation of excitons in NC placed in an optical cavity. We find that as the cavity photon energy decreases and/or the cavity--exciton coupling increases, the relaxation to thermal equilibrium is significantly slowed down, resulting in a polariton--induced phonon bottleneck, with relaxation timescales that are slower by orders of magnitude compared to the cavity--free case.

Comparing theory and experiment we demonstrate how this narrow resonance enables the dynamical creation of a large closed-channel molecular fraction superfluid, appearing in the vicinity of unitarity. Theoretically the observed superchemistry (\\textit{i.e.}, Bose enhanced reactions of atoms and molecules), is found to be assisted by the formation of Cooper pairs of bosonic atoms having opposite momenta. Importantly, this narrow resonance opens the possibility to explore the quantum critical point of a molecular Bose superfluid and related phenomena which would not be possible near a more typically broad Feshbach resonance.

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate optical detection at 12.5~bits per incident photon, 9.4~dB higher than the theoretical limit of conventional coherent detection. A single laser transmits both data and optical clock, undergoes 77~dB of attenuation before quantum detection followed by optical clock and data recovery. ",
