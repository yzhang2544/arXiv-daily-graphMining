    "abstract": "I. The arena of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is the abstract, unobserved and unobservable, M-dimensional formal Hilbert space [not equal to] spacetime. II. The arena of observations and, more generally, of all events (i.e. everything) in the real physical world, is the classical 4-dimensional physical spacetime. III. The \"Born Rule\" is the random process \"magically\" transforming I. into II. Wavefunctions are superposed and entangled only in the abstract space I., never in spacetime II. Attempted formulations of quantum theory directly in real physical spacetime actually constitute examples of \"locally real\" theories, as defined by Clauser & Horne, and are therefore already empirically refuted by the numerous tests of Bell's theorem in real, controlled experiments in laboratories here on Earth. Observed quantum entities, i.e. events, are never superposed or entangled as they: 1) Exclusively \"live\" (manifest) in real physical spacetime, 2) Are not described by entangled wavefunctions after \"measurement\", effectuated by III. When separated and treated correctly in this way, a number of fundamental problems and \"paradoxes\" of quantum theory vs. relativity (i.e. spacetime) simply vanish, such as the black hole information paradox, infinite zero-point energy of quantum field theory and quantization of general relativity.

    "abstract": "Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the most accurate of all experimentally verified physical theories. How QED and other theories of fundamental interactions couple to gravity through special unitary symmetries, on which the standard model of particle physics is based, is, however, still unknown. To enable a new kind of coupling between the electromagnetic field, Dirac electron-positron field, and the gravitational field, we develop a covariant spinorial photon equation with an eight-component spinorial representation of photons that is analogous to the well-known representation of particles in the Dirac theory. We reformulate QED using eight-component spinors. Furthermore, we introduce the generating Lagrangian density of gravity based on the special unitary symmetry of the eight-dimensional spinor space. The generating Lagrangian density of gravity plays, in the definition of the gauge theory of gravity and its symmetric stress-energy-momentum tensor source term, a similar role as the conventional Lagrangian density of the free Dirac field plays in the definition of the gauge theory of QED and its electric four-current density source term. The fundamental consequence, the Yang-Mills gauge theory of gravity, is studied in a separate work. We devote ample space for details of the eight-spinor QED to provide solid mathematical basis for the present work and the related work on the Yang-Mills gauge theory of gravity. ",

Engineered photonic lattices, with spatial regions of optical gain and loss, provide a prime and simple physical platform for tailoring non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and for unveiling the intriguing interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity. Here it is shown that in mosaic photonic lattices with on-site uncorrelated disorder or quasi-periodic order, the addition of uniform loss at alternating sites of the lattice results in the suppression or enhancement of wave spreading, thus providing a simple method for non-Hermitian control of wave transport in disordered systems.

    "abstract": "TurboGenius is an open-source Python package designed to fully control ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) jobs using a Python script, which allows one to perform high-throughput calculations combined with TurboRVB [K. Nakano et al. J. Phys. Chem. 152, 204121 (2020)]. This paper provides an overview of the TurboGenius package and showcases several results obtained in a high-throughput mode. For the purpose of performing high-throughput calculations with TurboGenius, we implemented another open-source Python package, TurboWorkflows, that enables one to construct simple workflows using TurboGenius. We demonstrate its effectiveness by performing (1) validations of density functional theory (DFT) and QMC drivers as implemented in the TurboRVB package and (2) benchmarks of Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for several data sets. For (1), we checked inter-package consistencies between TurboRVB and other established quantum chemistry packages. By doing so, we confirmed that DFT energies obtained by PySCF are consistent with those obtained by TurboRVB within the local density approximation (LDA), and that Hartree-Fock (HF) energies obtained by PySCF and Quantum Package are consistent with variational Monte Carlo energies obtained by TurboRVB with the HF wavefunctions. These validation tests constitute a further reliability check of the TurboRVB package. For (2), we benchmarked atomization energies of the Gaussian-2 set, binding energies of the S22, A24, and SCAI sets, and equilibrium lattice parameters of 12 cubic crystals using DMC calculations. We found that, for all compounds analyzed here, the DMC calculations with the LDA nodal surface give satisfactory results, i.e., consistent either with high-level computational or with experimental reference values.

The most pressing one, potentially, is the requirement for a substantial modulation strength in the material properties to create a noticeable momentum bandgap. Reaching that noticeable bandgap in optics is highly demanding with current, and possibly also future, material platforms since their modulation strength is small by tendency. Here we demonstrate that by introducing temporal variations in a resonant material, the momentum bandgap can be drastically expanded, potentially approaching infinity with modulation strengths in reach with known low-loss materials and realistic laser pump powers. The resonance can emerge from an intrinsic material resonance or a suitably spatially structured material supporting a structural resonance. Our concept is validated for resonant bulk media and optical metasurfaces and paves the way toward the first experimental realizations of photonic time crystals. ",

Copper demonstrated being a suitable cathode material in normal conducting injector cavities used at X-Ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) operating with pulsed RF.

    "abstract": "We present an experimental investigation of multiple scattering in photonic-crystal-based topological edge states with and without engineered random disorder. We map the spatial distribution of light as it propagates along a so-called bearded interface between two valley photonic crystals which supports both trivial and non-trivial edge states. As the light slows down and/or the disorder increases, we observe the photonic manifestation of Anderson localization, illustrated by the appearance of localized high-intensity field distributions. We extract the backscattering mean free path (BMFP) as a function of frequency, and thereby group velocity, for a range of geometrically engineered random disorders of different types. We observe that the BMFP is an order of magnitude higher for the non-trivial edge state than for the trivial. However, the BMFP for the non-trivial mode decreases rapidly with increasing disorder. As the light slows down the BMFP for the trivial state decreases as expected, but the BMFP for the topological state shows a non-trivial relation to group velocity. While the topological mode is not immune to backscattering at the disorder that breaks the protecting crystalline symmetry, it displays a larger robustness than the trivial mode for a specific range of parameters in the same structure. Intriguingly, the topological nature of the edge states appears to break the conventional relationship in which slower light always leads to more backscattering. ",

Secondly, the data-driven inverse problems are studied for PT-symmetric potential functions discovery rather than just potential parameters in the 1D and 2D SNLSEs. Particularly, we propose a modified PINNs (mPINNs) scheme to identify directly the PT potential functions of the 1D and 2D SNLSEs by the solution data. And the inverse problems about 1D and 2D PT -symmetric potentials depending on propagation distance z are also investigated using mPINNs method. We also identify the potential functions by the PINNs applied to the stationary equation of the SNLSE. Furthermore, two network structures are compared under different parameter conditions such that the predicted PT potentials can achieve the similar high accuracy. These results illustrate that the established deep neural networks can be successfully used in 1D and 2D SNLSEs with high accuracies. Moreover, some main factors affecting neural networks performance are discussed in 1D and 2D PT Scarf-II and periodic potentials, including activation functions, structures of the networks, and sizes of the training data. In particular, twelve different nonlinear activation functions are in detail analyzed containing the periodic and non-periodic functions such that it is concluded that selecting activation functions according to the form of solution and equation usually can achieve better effect.

By using numerical experiments on a two-level quantum system, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve a similar optimal performance as Bayesian inference, while drastically reducing computational costs. Additionally, the method exhibits robustness against the presence of imperfections in both measurement and training data. This approach offers a promising and computationally efficient tool for quantum parameter estimation with photon-counting data, relevant for applications such as quantum sensing or quantum imaging, as well as robust calibration tasks in laboratory-based settings.

Here, we propose a single-shot nondestructive quantum sensing method addressing such an issue. Our scheme consists of two steps. In the first step, the two enantiomers are prepared in different rotational states via microwave enantio-specific state transfer. Then, the chiral discrimination is transferred to quantum hypothesis testing. In the second step, we for the first time introduce a non-destructive quantum-state detection technique assisted with a microwave resonator to chiral discrimination, through which the molecular chirality is determined by the sign of the output signals. Using a typical chiral molecule, 1,2-propanediol, and an experimentally feasible model based on spherical Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity, we show that the molecular chirality of slowly moving enantiopure gaseous samples with $10^2 - 10^3$ molecules can be highly credibly distinguished in a single-shot detection. By further trapping chiral molecules, it is promising to achieve chiral discrimination at the single molecule level by using our approach. ",

For this purpose, we develop the theory of entanglement-assisted quantum chiral spectroscopy. Our results show that the signals of left- and right-handed molecules in the quantum spectrum are always distinguishable by suitably configuring the entangled probe photons.
