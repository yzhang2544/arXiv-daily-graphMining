To achieve this, the plan involves incorporating three new magnetic alloy cavities while maintaining the existing system to enable double harmonic acceleration. As a consequence of the increased current intensity, the beam loading effect will be significantly amplified, presenting a considerable challenge for the low-level RF control system of the magnetic alloy cavity. To address this challenge, an adaptive feedforward algorithm has been developed to enable optimal control.

    "abstract": "Coherent acoustic phonon generation and detection assisted by optical resonances are at the core of efficient optophononic transduction processes. However, when dealing with a single optical resonance, the optimum generation and detection conditions take place at different laser wavelengths, i.e. different detunings from the cavity mode. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the use of elliptical micropillars to reach these conditions simultaneously at a single wavelength. Elliptical micropillar optophononic resonators present two optical modes with orthogonal polarizations at different wavelengths. By employing a cross-polarized scheme pump-probe experiment, we exploit the mode splitting and couple the pump beam to one mode while the probe is detuned from the other one. In this way, at a particular micropillar ellipticity, both phonon generation and detection processes are enhanced. We report an enhancement of a factor of ~3.1 when comparing the signals from elliptical and circular micropillars. Our findings constitute a step forward in tailoring the light-matter interaction for more efficient ultrahigh-frequency optophononic devices. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic integrated circuits offer a compact and stable platform for generating, manipulating, and detecting light. They are instrumental for classical and quantum applications. Imperfections stemming from fabrication constraints, tolerances and operation wavelength impose limitations on the accuracy and thus utility of current photonic integrated devices. Mitigating these imperfections typically necessitates a model of the underlying physical structure and the estimation of parameters that are challenging to access. Direct solutions are currently lacking for mesh configurations extending beyond trivial cases. We introduce a scalable and innovative method to characterize photonic chips through an iterative machine learning-assisted procedure. Our method is based on a clear-box approach that harnesses a fully modeled virtual replica of the photonic chip to characterize. The process is sample-efficient and can be carried out with a continuous-wave laser and powermeters. The model estimates individual passive phases, crosstalk, beamsplitter reflectivity values and relative input/output losses. Building upon the accurate characterization results, we mitigate imperfections to enable enhanced control over the device. We validate our characterization and imperfection mitigation methods on a 12-mode Clements-interferometer equipped with 126 phase shifters, achieving beyond state-of-the-art chip control with an average 99.77 % amplitude fidelity on 100 implemented Haar-random unitary matrices.

A low phase noise dual frequency Master Oscillator (MO), where the two frequencies are related by a fractional ratio of 608/609 and flexible divide by four frequency outputs has been consolidated into a single chassis. Optical fiber clock distribution system has been selected over the old coax system used in ALS to distribute these signals to various clients across the facility, providing high electrical isolation between outputs and therefore lower phase errors. A Xilinx FPGA ties the MO chassis together by providing a RS-485 interface to monitor and control the system.

The quantum frequency comb, that is, a coherent superposition of multiple frequency modes, is proven to be a frequency-entangled qudit state. We also show that dissipative Kerr soliton combs are highly coherent and mode-locked due to the collective coherence or self-organization of solitons. Moreover, the valley kink states allow both quantum frequency combs and dissipative Kerr soliton combs with robustness against sharp bends.

    "abstract": "A new frontier in optics research has been opened by the recent developments in non-perturbative optical modulation in both time and space that creates temporal boundaries generating ``time-reflection'' and ``time-refraction'' of light in the medium. The resulting formation of a Photonic Time Crystal within the modulated optical material leads to a broad range new phenomena with a potential for practical applications, from non-resonant light amplification and tunable lasing, to the new regime of quantum light-matter interactions. However, the formation of the temporal boundary for light relies on optical modulation of the refractive index that is both strong and fast even on the time scale of a single optical cycle. Both of these two problems are extremely challenging even when addressed independently, leading to conflicting requirements for all existing methods of optical modulation. However, as we show in the present work, an alternative approach based on virtual interband transition excitation, solves this seemingly insurmountable problem. Being fundamentally dissipation-free, optical modulation by virtual excitation does not face the problem of heat accumulation and dissipation in the material, while the transient nature of the excited virtual population that modifies the material response only on the time scale of a single optical cycle, ensures that the resulting change in the refractive index is inherently ultrafast. Here we develop the theoretical description of the proposed modulation approach, and demonstrate that it can be readily implemented using already existing optical materials and technology. ",

    "abstract": "During the pulsed operation of the linear accelerator in DCLS (Dalian Coherent Light Source), we found a strong correlation between the klystron modulator's high voltage and the klystron output microwave, with noticeable jitter among adjacent microwaves. Therefore, we propose an intra-pulse feedforward algorithm and implement it in LLRF (Low-Level Radiofrequency) systems. This algorithm assumes that the transfer model of the microwave system is linear within a small range of work points and measures the transfer coefficient of the microwave between the LLRF and klystron. For each pulsed microwave of the klystron output, the LLRF system first calculates the vector deviation between the initial measurement within its pulse and the target. The deviation will be compensated in the LLRF excitation so that the jitter in the later part of the pulsed microwave is suppressed. Experiments have shown that this algorithm can effectively suppress the jitter among adjacent microwaves, e.g., improving the amplitude and phase stability (RMS) from 0.11%/0.2{\\deg} to 0.1%/0.05{\\deg}. This algorithm can also be applied to other accelerators operating in pulsed modes. ",

    "abstract": "The future of quantum information processing hinges on chip-scale nanophotonics, specifically cavity QED and waveguide QED. One of the foremost processes underpinning quantum photonic technologies is the phenomenon of Rabi oscillations, which manifests when a qubit is irradiated by an intense laser source. Departing from the conventional semiclassical framework, we expound on the more general, quantum-theoretic case where the optical excitation takes the form of a multiphoton Fock state, and the qubit couples to a continuum of radiation modes. By employing the real-space formalism, we analytically explore the scattering dynamics of the photonic Fock state as it interfaces with a two-level emitter. The resulting amplitude for atomic excitation features a linear superposition of various independent scattering events that are triggered by the potential of sequential photon absorptions and emissions. The lowest-order excitation event, initiated by the stochastic scattering of one of the several photons, aptly characterizes the dynamics in a weak-field environment. This is complemented by a multitude of higher-order scattering events ensuing from repeated atom-photon interactions. The temporal evolution of the qubit excitation in our configuration closely mirrors the semiclassical predictions, particularly in the strong-pumping limit where Rabi oscillations unfold. Notably, this compatibility with the semiclassical paradigm applies both to the weak-driving and large-detuning limits. Our analysis, therefore, extends the existing results on quantum Rabi oscillations pertinent to single-mode cavity QED, to the multimode, waveguide-QED configurations wherein flying photons are the information carriers. Finally, we explore the scattering dynamics of pulsed wave packets, highlighting the potential to substantially enhance excitation efficiency, even in scenarios involving just a few photons. ",

    "abstract": "The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and, with Hilbert transforms as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions of the radiation field inside the medium and, for a semi-infinite medium, also those of the emerging field.
