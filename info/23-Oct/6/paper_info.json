    "abstract": "The concepts of topology provide a powerful tool to tailor the propagation and localization of light. While electromagnetic waves have only two polarization states, engineered degeneracies of photonic modes provide novel opportunities resembling orbital or spin degrees of freedom in condensed matter. Here, we tailor such degeneracies for the array of femtosecond laser written waveguides in the optical range exploiting the idea of photonic molecules -- clusters of strongly coupled waveguides. In our experiments, we observe the emergence of topological modes caused by the inter-orbital coupling and track multiple topological transitions in the system with the change of the lattice spacings and excitation wavelength. This strategy opens an avenue in designing novel types of photonic topological phases and states. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss and address the challenges of predicting extreme atmospheric events like intense rainfall, hail, and strong winds. These events can cause significant damage and have become more frequent due to climate change. Integrating climate projections with machine learning techniques helps improve forecasting accuracy and identify regions where these events become most frequent and dangerous. To achieve reliable and accurate prediction, we propose a robust neural network architecture that outperforms multiple baselines in accuracy and reliability. Our physics-informed algorithm heavily utilizes the whole range of problem-specific physics, including a specific set of features and climate projections data. The analysis also emphasizes the landscape impact on the frequency distribution of these events, providing valuable insights for effective adaptation strategies in response to climate change. ",

    "abstract": "We report the experimental study of the structural transition of a stable complex plasma crystal to a solid-liquid phase coexistence by the controlled adjustment of the confinement potential, while keeping all other parameters constant. The experiments are carried out in a tabletop Linear Dusty Plasma Experimental (LDPEx) device which consists of a circular powered electrode and an extended grounded cathode plate. A stationary crystal of melamine formaldehyde particles is formed in a background of Argon plasma inside a confining ring that is isolated to the cathode by a ceramic cover. The stable crystal structure breaks in the core region and transitions to a coexistent state by carefully changing the confining potential, thereby modifying the sheath structure. The transition is confirmed by evaluating the variation in different characteristic parameters such as the pair correlation function, local bond order parameter, and dust kinetic temperature as a function of confining bias potential. It is found that melting in the core is due to the onset of dust fluctuations in the layers beneath the topmost layer, which grow in amplitude as the confining bias potential is reduced below a threshold value. The present technique of changing confinement provides a unique feature to study structural transitions of plasma crystals without affecting the overall plasma parameters. ",

The chemical inertness of efficient second-order nonlinear materials ($\\chi^{(2)}$) prohibited their nanofabrication until 2018. The current method is restricted to top-down laser-based techniques limiting the periodicity along z-axis to 10 um. We demonstrate the first bottom-up fabricated 3D NPhC in sol-gel derived barium titanate by soft-nanoimprint lithography: a woodpile with eight layers and periodicities of 1 um (xy-plane) and 300 nm (z-plane). The surface areas exceed $5.3\\cdot 10^4$ um^2, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art.

A challenge to SHB is the high level of shot noise due to the laser power constraint imposed by the spectroscopic sample. Here, we have demonstrated the production, detection, and separation of multiple optical frequency modes to the benefit of optical environment sensing for realtime phase noise subtraction as well as shot noise reduction through multi-mode averaging. This has allowed us to achieve improved noise performance in low-optical-power interferometry. Although our target application is laser stabilization via SHB in cryogenic temperature rare-earth doped crystals, these techniques may be employed in a variety of different contexts. ",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional reconstruction of vocal folds in medicine usually involves endoscopy and an approach to extract depth information like structured light or stereo matching of images. The resulting mesh can accurately represent the superior area of the vocal folds, while new approaches also try to reconstruct the inferior area. We propose a novel approach to extract the time-dependent 3D geometry of the vocal fold from optical measurements on both the superior and inferior side, requiring optical measurements only from the superior side. First, a time-dependent, tri-variate surface velocity vector field is reconstructed using a high-speed camera and a laser Doppler vibrometer in an experimental environment. This vector field serves as target in an inverse finite-element simulation that optimizes the forces applied to a deformable vocal fold model such that the resulting movement after FEM simulation matches the velocity observations on the superior side. The required forces for the finite element method simulation are treated as unknowns and are assembled using multiple scalar fields. We use tensor products in B\\'ezier Bernstein basis for our scalar fields to reduce the degrees of freedom for our optimization. We use gradient descent to optimize the control points of the force field polynomials. Our utilized error metric for gradient descent consists of two terms. The first term is used to match the simulated velocities to the observed measurements, while the second term measures the silhouette difference between observation and simulation. ",

Here, we demonstrate two distinct classes of corner states in breathing Kagome lattices (BKLs) with \"bearded\" edge truncation, unveiling their topological origin. The in-phase corner states are found to exist only in the topologically nontrivial regime, characterized by a nonzero bulk polarization. In contrast, the out-of-phase corner states appear in both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes, either as bound states in the continuum or as in-gap states depending on the lattice dimerization conditions. Furthermore, the out-of-phase corner states are highly localized, akin to flat-band compact localized states, and they manifest both real- and momentum-space topology. Experimentally, we observe both types of corner states in laser-written photonic bearded-edge BKLs, corroborated by numerical simulations. Our results not only deepen the current understanding of topological corner modes in BKLs, but also provide new insight into their physical origins, which may be applied to other topological BKL platforms beyond optics.

However, the design of optimal near-field thermal radiation structure is a complex and challenging problem due to the tremendous number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we have proposed a data-driven machine learning workflow to efficiently design multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials composed of ${\\alpha}$-MoO$_{\\rm 3}$ for near-field thermal radiative modulator with high modulation contrast. By combining the multilayer perceptron and Bayesian optimization, the rotation angle, layer thickness and gap distance of the multilayer metamaterials are optimized to achieve a maximum thermal modulation contrast ratio of 6.29. This represents a 97% improvement compared to previous single layer structure. The large thermal modulation contrast is mainly attributed to the alignment and misalignment of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons and hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons of each layer controlled by the rotation. The results provide a promising way for accelerating the designing and manipulating of near-field radiative heat transfer by anisotropic hyperbolic materials through the data-driven style. ",

Here, we study the role of spatial optical coherence in DONN operation. We propose a numerical approach to efficiently simulate DONNs under input illumination with arbitrary spatial coherence and discuss the corresponding computational complexity using coherent, partially coherent, and incoherent light. We also investigate the expressive power of DONNs and examine how coherence affects their performance. In particular, we show that under fully incoherent illumination, the DONN performance cannot surpass that of a linear model. As a demonstration, we train and evaluate simulated DONNs on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using light with varying spatial coherence. ",

However, fabricating ONAs while maintaining design performances is challenging. Limitations in fabrication techniques often limit the realizable precision of the trained parameters. Physical constraints may also limit the range of values the physical parameters can hold. Thus, ONAs should be trained within the implementable constraints. However, such physics-based constraints reduce the training objective to a constrained optimization problem, making it harder to optimize with existing gradient-based methods. To alleviate these critical issues that degrade performance from simulation to realization we propose a physics-informed quantization-aware training framework. Our approach accounts for the physical constraints during the training process, leading to robust designs. We evaluate our approach on an ONA proposed in the literature, named a diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), for all-optical phase imaging and for classification of phase objects. With extensive experiments on different quantization levels and datasets, we show that our approach leads to ONA designs that are robust to quantization noise. ",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear curvature wavefront sensor (nlCWFS) offers improved sensitivity for adaptive optics (AO) systems compared to existing wavefront sensors, such as the Shack-Hartmann. The nominal nlCWFS design uses a series of imaging planes offset from the pupil along the optical propagation axis as inputs to a numerically-iterative reconstruction algorithm. Research into the nlCWFS has assumed that the device uses four measurement planes configured symmetrically around the optical system pupil. This assumption is not strictly required. In this paper, we perform the first systematic exploration of the location, number, and spatial sampling of measurement planes for the nlCWFS. Our numerical simulations show that the original, symmetric four-plane configuration produces the most consistently accurate results in the shortest time over a broad range of seeing conditions. We find that the inner measurement planes should be situated past the Talbot distance corresponding to a spatial period of $r_0$. The outer planes should be large enough to fully capture field intensity and be situated beyond a distance corresponding to a Fresnel-number-scaled equivalent of $Z\\approx50$ km for a $D=0.5$ m pupil with $\\lambda=532$ nm. The minimum spatial sampling required for diffraction-limited performance is 4-5 pixels per $r_0$ as defined in the pupil plane. We find that neither three-plane nor five-plane configurations offer significant improvements compared to the original design. These results can impact future implementations of the nlCWFS by informing sensor design. ",

Here, we investigate the role of optical penetration depth on this photomechanical response. We present a model of the photomechanical behavior of photoactive LCE strips under illumination that goes beyond the common assumption of shallow penetration. This model reveals how the optical penetration depth and the consequent photomechanically induced deformation can depend on the concentration of photoactive molecules, their absorption cross-sections, and the intensity of illumination. Through a series of examples, we show that the penetration depth can quantitatively and qualitatively affect the photomechanical response of a strip. Shallow illumination leads to monotone curvature change while deep penetration can lead to non-monotone response with illumination duration. Further, the flapping behavior (a cyclic wave-like motion) of doubly clamped and buckled strips that has been proposed for locomotion can reverse direction with sufficiently large penetration depth. This opens the possibility of creating wireless light-driven photomechanical actuators and swimmers whose direction of motion can be controlled by light intensity and frequency. ",
