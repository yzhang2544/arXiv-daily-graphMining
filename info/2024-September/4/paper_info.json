In this paper, we propose efforts to include quantum computing as a fundamental pillar of Colombia's development plan. In this research we involved three stakeholders: academia (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), industry (Alianza Team), and government (Vice Ministry of Digital Transformation).

It illustrates the characteristics of energy bandgaps, momentum bandgaps, and mixed energy momentum bandgap eigenmodes within the dispersion relation of these crystals. Additionally, the article details the properties of second order exceptional points that occur when two bandgaps overlap under specific conditions.

Previous open-source codes often include only one portion of what is needed to calculate the spectral response of a nanoparticulate medium, such as Mie theory or a Monte Carlo method. FOS is designed to provide a convenient fully integrated format to remove the barrier as well as providing a significantly accelerated implementation with compiled Python code, parallel processing, and pre-trained machine learning predictions. This program can accelerate optimization and high throughput design of optical properties of nanoparticle or nanocomposite media, such as radiative cooling paint and solar heating liquids, allowing for the discovery of new materials and designs. FOS also enables convenient modeling of lunar dust coatings, combustion particulates, and many other particulate systems.

The technique involves continuously scanning the length of a high-finesse cavity to periodically lock a diode laser to the cavity resonance, resulting in a discrete set of transmission measurements that are evenly spaced in frequency. For a fixed laser bias, data can be collected spanning a spectral bandwidth equivalent to the free-spectral range of the cavity, with spectral resolution inversely proportional to the distance from the laser to cavity. The center frequency of this scan can be tuned by tuning the free-running laser frequency. We demonstrate the concept using a fiber-coupled 1578-nm laser and a scanning Fabry-Perot cavity to measure a series of weak CO2 absorption lines with a frequency resolution of 15.6 MHz and a noise equivalent absorption coefficient of 10-7 cm-1, limited by the moderate finesse (~5000) and short length (~5 cm) of the cavity. Individual CO2 line shapes can be measured with high resolution in a single scan that takes 67 ms. The approach has a combination of characteristics that are advantageous for in situ instruments, such as small size, high spectral resolution, fast data collection, and minimal components.         ",

    "abstract": "           This paper derives and demonstrates a new, purely density-based ab initio approach for calculation of the energies and properties of many-electron systems. It is based upon the discovery of relationships that govern the \"mechanics\" of the electron density -- i.e., relations that connect its behaviors at different points in space. Unlike wave mechanics or prior electron-density-based implementations, such as DFT, this density-mechanical implementation of quantum mechanics involves no many-electron or one-electron wave functions (i.e., orbitals). Thus, there is no need to calculate exchange energies, because there are no orbitals to permute or \"exchange\" within two-electron integrals used to calculate electron-electron repulsion energies. In practice, exchange does not exist within quantum density mechanics. In fact, no two-electron integrals need be calculated at all, beyond a single coulomb integral for the 2-electron system. Instead, a \"radius expansion method\" is introduced that permits determination of the two-electron interaction for an N-electron system from one with (N-1)-electrons. Also, the method does not rely upon a Schrodinger-like equation or the variational method for determination of accurate energies and densities. Rather, the above-described results follow from the derivation and solution of a \"governing equation\" for each number of electrons to obtain a screening relation that connects the behavior at the \"tail\" of a one-electron density, to that at the Bohr radius. Solution of these equations produces simple expressions that deliver a total energy for a 2-electron atom that is nearly identical to the experimental value, plus accurate energies for neutral 3, 4, and 5-electron atoms, along with accurate one-electron densities of these atoms. Further, these methods scale in complexity only as N, not as a power of N, as do most other accurate many-electron methods.         ",

    "abstract": "           Topological photonics has revolutionized manipulations of electromagnetic waves by leveraging various topological phases proposed originally in condensed matters, leading to robust and error-immune signal processing. Despite considerable efforts, a critical challenge remains in devising frequency routers operating at a broadband frequency range with limited crosstalk. Previous designs usually relied on fine tuning of parameters and are difficult to be integrated efficiently and compactly. Here, targeting the demand for frequency-selective applications in on-chip photonics, we explore a topological approach to photonic frequency router via valley-Hall metacrystals. Diverging from the majority of studies which focuses on zigzag interfaces, our research shifts the attention to armchair interfaces within an ABA sandwich-like structure, where a single column of type-B metacrystal acts as a perturbation in the background type-A metacrystal. Essentially, through tuning a single geometric parameter of the type-B metacrystal, this configuration gives rise to interface states within a customized frequency band, enabling signal routing with limited crosstalk to meet specified demands. Moreover, this concept is practically demonstrated through a photonic frequency router with three distinct channels, experimentally exhibiting robust wave transmissions with excellent agreement with the design. This investigation manifests possible applications of the armchair interfaces in valley-Hall photonic systems and advances development of photonic devices that are both compact and efficient. Notably, the approach is naturally compatible with on-chip photonics and integration, which could benefit telecommunications and optical computing applications.         ",

To achieve optimal sensitivity, cooling, and quantum control in these systems, it is beneficial to achieve optimal displacement detection using scattered light.

We demonstrate the agreement between our method and prior methods employed for spherical particles, both in the Rayleigh and Lorentz-Mie regimes.

If locking to any resonant frequency is allowed, the capture range is infinite. From the effect of using both lights, our method achieves the highest sensitivity to the frequency fluctuations around the resonant frequency and provides robustness against the interferometer fluctuations.

We demonstrate the potential of this approach by engineering the spatial distribution of the complex susceptibility tensor of the medium in photonic structures to realize nonreciprocal optical effects. Specifically, we investigate the advantages of chiral interaction between atoms and photons in an atom-cladded waveguide, theoretically showing that reconfigurable, strong, and fastly switchable isolation of optical signals in a selected optical mode is possible.

By adjusting the round-trip gain and time delay of the OEO loop, a radio frequency (RF) signal with a frequency that is 1/N that of the injection signal is generated, thus N times frequency division is achieved. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ILFD. The results demonstrate that the system can divide a RF signal from 2.6 to 20.8 GHz to 1.3 to 1.95 GHz with different frequency division factors ranging from 2 to 13. A significant improvement in phase noise of 35.11 dB is also obtained at a frequency offset of 100 kHz when the frequency division factor is 13.         ",

The effectiveness of the multi-frequency NeuralBIM is validated through synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency for solving ISP. Moreover, this method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and noise resistance.

    "abstract": "           We report strongly thermochromic YSZ/V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2/SiO2 coatings, where YSZ is Y stabilized ZrO2, prepared using a scalable deposition technique on standard glass at a low substrate temperature of 320 \u00b0C and without any substrate bias voltage. The coatings exhibit a transition temperature of 22 \u00b0C with an integral luminous transmittance of 63.7% (low-temperature state) and 60.7% (high-temperature state), and a modulation of the solar energy transmittance of 11.2%. Such a combination of properties, together with the low deposition temperature, fulfill the requirements for large-scale implementation on building glass and have not been reported yet. Reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow feedback control allows us to prepare crystalline W and Sr co-doped VO2 of the correct stoichiometry. The W doping of VO2 decreases the transition temperature, while the Sr doping of VO2 increases the luminous transmittance significantly. A coating design utilizing a second-order interference in two antireflection layers is used to maximize both the integral luminous transmittance and the modulation of the solar energy transmittance. A compact crystalline structure of the bottom YSZ antireflection layer further improves the VO2 crystallinity, while the top SiO2 antireflection layer provides also the mechanical and environmental protection for the V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2 layer.

Here, we report an experimental realization of circularly-symmetric OVLs with alternating positive and negative TCs of order +/-n, referred to the $n$th-order circularly-symmetric alternating OVL (CSAOVL). The focusing fields of such CSAOVLs exhibit the very interesting patterns with a period of 4 for different n values, and their intensity and phase distributions can be regulated using the radial and azimuthal parameters. Particularly, the formed central bright spot in the focusing fields of those CSAOVLs with n equaling to a multiple of 4 is observed to be much smaller than a Gaussian spot. The results can promote significantly the exploration of structured OVLs and provide potential applications in particle manipulation, imaging, and the realization of complex interactions between optical lattices and microscope particles such as atoms and micro- or nano-particles.

To address this, we use a recently proposed phase noise measurement technique that employs multi-heterodyne detection and subspace tracking. This allows for the measurement of the common mode, repetition-rate and high-order phase noise terms, and their corresponding scaling as a function of a comb-line number, using a single measurement set-up.

    "title": "Maximum Shannon Capacity of Photonic Structures",
    "abstract": "           Information transfer through electromagnetic waves is an important problem that touches a variety of technologically relevant applications, including computing and telecommunications. Prior attempts to establish limits on optical information transfer have treated waves propagating through known photonic structures (including vacuum). In this article, we address fundamental questions concerning optimal information transfer in photonic devices. Combining information theory, wave scattering, and optimization theory, we formulate bounds on the maximum Shannon capacity that may be achieved by structuring senders, receivers, and their environment. Allowing for arbitrary structuring leads to a non-convex problem that is significantly more difficult than its fixed structure counterpart, which is convex and satisfies a known \"water-filling\" solution. We derive a geometry-agnostic convex relaxation of the problem that elucidates fundamental physics and scaling behavior of Shannon capacity with respect to device parameters and the importance of structuring for enhancing capacity. We also show that in regimes where communication is dominated by power insertion requirements, maximum Shannon capacity maps to a biconvex optimization problem in the basis of singular vectors of the Green's function. This problem admits analytical solutions that give physically intuitive interpretations of channel and power allocation and reveals how Shannon capacity varies with signal-to-noise ratio. Proof of concept numerical examples show that bounds are within an order of magnitude of achievable device performance and successfully predict the scaling of performance with channel noise. The presented methodologies have implications for the optimization of antennas, integrated photonic devices, metasurface kernels, MIMO space-division multiplexers, and waveguides to maximize communication efficiency and bit-rates.

For long-distance outdoor wireless communications, THz channels may suffer substantial power loss and security issues due to atmospheric weather effects. It is crucial to assess the impact of weather on high-capacity data transmission to evaluate wireless system link budgets and performance accurately. In this article, we provide an insight into the propagation characteristics of THz channels under atmospheric conditions and the security aspects of THz communication systems in future applications. We conduct a comprehensive survey of our recent research and experimental findings on THz channel transmission and physical layer security, synthesizing and categorizing the state-of-the-art research in this domain. Our analysis encompasses various atmospheric phenomena, including molecular absorption, scattering effects, and turbulence, elucidating their intricate interactions with THz waves and the resultant implications for channel modeling and system design. Furthermore, we investigate the unique security challenges posed by THz communications, examining potential vulnerabilities and proposing novel countermeasures to enhance the resilience of these high-frequency systems against eavesdropping and other security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of such high-frequency wireless communications and provide insights into future research prospects for realizing the 6G vision, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome the atmospheric hurdles and security concerns in THz communications.

Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with only one L\u00e9vy index $\\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\u00e9vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\u00e9vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.         ",

We have proved there that the palette and grain combination problems of panpsychism and panprotopsychism arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience that are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. In this article, we address what is probably the first and most important combination problem of panpsychism: the subject-summing problem originally posed by William James. We begin by identifying the physical counterparts of the subjects of experience within the quantum panprotopsychic approach presented in that article. To achieve this, we turn to the notion of subject of experience inspired by the idea of prehension proposed by Whitehead and show that this notion can be adapted to the quantum ontology of objects and events. Due to the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics and its causal openness, this ontology also seems to be suitable for the analysis of the remaining aspects of the structure combination problem, which shows how the structuration of consciousness could have evolved from primitive animals to humans. The analysis imposes conditions on possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain and suggests new problems and strategies to address them. In particular, with regard to the structuring of experiences in animals with different degrees of evolutionary development.         ",

This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.

Because of this, maintaining THz channel reliability and efficiency in adverse weather conditions is crucial. Rain, in particular, disrupts THz channel propagation significantly and there is still lack of comprehensive investigations due to the involved experimental difficulties. This work explores how rain affects THz channel performance by conducting experiments in a rain emulation chamber and under actual rainy conditions outdoors. We focus on variables like rain intensity, raindrop size distribution (RDSD), and the channel's gradient height. We observe that the gradient height (for air-to-ground channel) can induce changes of the RDSD along the channel's path, impacting the precision of modeling efforts. To address this, we propose a theoretical model, integrating Mie scattering theory with considerations of channel's gradient height. Both our experimental and theoretical findings confirm this model's effectiveness in predicting THz channel behavior in rainy conditions. This work underscores the necessary in incorporating the variation of RDSD when THz channel travels in scenarios involving ground-to-air or air-to-ground communications.         ",

The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.         ",

Here, we introduce a novel architecture of photonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices, usually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or quantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter meshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous designs, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology. We have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower depth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware errors.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are subjects of both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the refractive index of a material under intense laser illumination. This effect is inherently weak, limiting its practical use in free-space nanophotonics. In this work, we demonstrate an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by more than three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating with an overall thickness of less than 300 nm. Our study involves the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses. We observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, leading to more than fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude and enabling transitions between `Off' and `On' states of transmission. We also demonstrate the capability of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The results presented here reveal promising directions for developing advanced all-optical devices based on free-space nanophotonics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Continuous seismic monitoring of the near-surface structure is crucial for urban infrastructure safety, aiding in the detection of sinkholes, subsidence, and other seismic hazards. Utilizing existing telecommunication optical fibers as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems offers a cost-effective method for creating dense seismic arrays in urban areas. DAS leverages roadside fiber-optic cables to record vehicle-induced surface waves for near-surface imaging. However, the influence of roadway vehicle characteristics on their induced surface waves and the resulting imaging of near-surface structures is poorly understood. We investigate surface waves generated by vehicles of varying weights and speeds to provide insights into accurate and efficient near-surface characterization. We first classify vehicles into light, mid-weight, and heavy based on the maximum amplitudes of quasi-static DAS records. Vehicles are also classified by their traveling speed using their arrival times at DAS channels. To investigate how vehicle characteristics influence the induced surface waves, we extract phase velocity dispersion and invert the subsurface structure for each vehicle class by retrieving virtual shot gathers (VSGs). Our results reveal that heavy vehicles produce higher signal-to-noise ratio surface waves, and a sevenfold increase in vehicle weight can reduce uncertainties in phase velocity measurements from dispersion spectra by up to 3X. Thus, data from heavy vehicles better constrain structures at greater depths. Additionally, with driving speeds ranging from 5 to 30 meters per second in our study, differences in the dispersion curves due to vehicle speed are less pronounced than those due to vehicle weight. Our results suggest judiciously selecting and processing surface wave signals from certain vehicle types can improve the quality of near-surface imaging in urban environments.         ",

    "abstract": "           Complex networks are abundant in nature and many share an important structural property: they contain a few nodes that are abnormally highly connected (hubs). Some of these hubs are called influencers because they couple strongly to the network and play fundamental dynamical and structural roles. Strikingly, despite the abundance of networks with influencers, little is known about their response to stochastic forcing. Here, for oscillatory dynamics on influencer networks, we show that subjecting influencers to an optimal intensity of noise can result in enhanced network synchronization. This new network dynamical effect, which we call coherence resonance in influencer networks, emerges from a synergy between network structure and stochasticity and is highly nonlinear, vanishing when the noise is too weak or too strong. Our results reveal that the influencer backbone can sharply increase the dynamical response in complex systems of coupled oscillators.         ",

However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.         ",

    "abstract": "           Nonlinear optics plays important roles in the research of fundamental physics and the applications of high-performance optoelectronic devices. The bulk nonlinear optical responses arise from the uniform light absorption in noncentrosymmetric crystals, and hence are usually considered to be the collective phenomena of all atoms. Here we show, in contrast to this common expectation, the nonlinear optical responses in antiferromagnets can be selectively accumulated near the surfaces, representing a skin effect. This is because the inversion symmetry, despite being broken globally by magnetism, is barely violated locally deeply inside these antiferromagnets. Using A-type layered antiferromagnets as the representatives, we predict that the spatial-dependent nonlinear optical responses, such as bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are notable in the top- and bottom-most layers and decay rapidly when moving away from the surfaces. Such a phenomenon is strongly associated with the antiferromagnetism and exists in a broad range of antiferromagnets composed of centrosymmetric sublattices, offering promising device applications using these antiferromagnets. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked property of nonlinear optical responses and opens new opportunities for high-performance antiferromagnetic optospintronics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n > 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.         ",

Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the magnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic derivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.         ",
