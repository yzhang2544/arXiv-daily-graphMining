    "abstract": "           Postselection is an operation that allows the selection of specific measurement outcomes. It serves as a powerful theoretical tool for enhancing the performance of existing quantum algorithms. Despite recent developments such as time reversal in quantum measurements and IBM's mid-circuit measurements, postselection continues to face significant challenges, most notably poor, often exponential, scaling. This study investigates how Two-Way Quantum Computing (2WQC) offers potential solutions to these challenges. By introducing the concept of postparation and enabling dynamic quantum state control, 2WQC has the potential to mitigate scaling issues and improve the practicality of postselection, thereby fostering advancements in the field of quantum algorithms.

    "abstract": "           The expansion dynamics of laser produced plasma plumes in gaseous atmospheres exhibit information on plasma-ambient gas interactions which result in plume splitting, shock formation, sharpening and confinement. We investigate laser spot size variation on shock wave, plume, and ion dynamics from laser produced YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) plasmas using fast photography and Langmuir probe diagnosis. Changes in plume geometry are observed with varying focal spot size. At smaller spot sizes, lateral expansion of the plume is found to be larger, and plume expansion is spherical, while at larger spot sizes plume expansion is more cylindrical. Shock front formation time, relative intensity, spatial extent and total charge yield (TCY) are all dependent on laser spot size. Total charge yield (TCY) increases as the spot area increases, but decreases beyond a certain value. The width of the ion velocity distribution and the peak velocity decrease with increasing spot size, demonstrate that ions corresponding to larger spot sizes are somewhat more monoenergetic.

Here, we first derive three-wave equations that describe multi-color solitons that appear in microresonators with a nearly quartic dispersion profile. These solitons are characterized by a single angular group velocity and multiple angular phase velocities. We then use these equations to explain the interleaved frequency combs that are observed at the output of the microresonator. Finally, we used these equations to describe the experimentally-observed soliton-OPO effect. In this effect, the pump frequency comb interacts nonlinearly with a signal frequency comb to create an idler frequency comb in a new frequency range, analogous to an optical parametric oscillation (OPO) process. We determine the conditions under which we expect this effect to occur. We anticipate that the three-wave equations and their extensions will be of use in designing new frequency comb systems and determining their stability and noise performance.         ",

For that purpose, new experimental speed of sound data are presented in the pressure range between (0.1 up to 13) MPa and at temperatures of (260, 273.16, 300, 325, and 350) K for two mixtures qualified as primary calibration standards: a 11 component synthetic natural gas mixture (11 M), and another low-calorific $H_{2}$-enriched natural gas mixture with a nominal molar percentage $x_{H_{2}}$ = 3%. Measurements have been gathered using a spherical acoustic resonator with an experimental expanded ($k$ = 2) uncertainty better than 200 parts in $10^{6}$ (0.02%) in the speed of sound. The heat capacity ratio as perfect-gas $\\gamma_{pg}$, the molar heat capacity as perfect-gas $C_{p,m}^{pg}$, and the second $\\beta_{a}$ and third $\\gamma_{a}$ acoustic virial coefficients are derived from the speed of sound values. All the results are compared with the reference mixture models for natural gas-like mixtures, the AGA8-DC92 EoS and the GERG-2008 EoS, with special attention to the impact of hydrogen on those properties. Data are found to be mostly consistent within the model uncertainty in the 11 M synthetic mixture as expected, but for the hydrogen-enriched mixture in the limit of the model uncertainty at the highest measuring pressures.

Hall-effect devices hold the largest share of the magnetic sensor market, and they are particularly valued for their reliability, low cost and CMOS compatibility. This paper introduces a novel 3-axis Hall-effect sensor element based on an inverted pyramid structure, realized by leveraging MEMS micromachining and CMOS processing. The devices are manufactured by etching the pyramid openings with TMAH and implanting the sloped walls with n-dopants to define the active area. Through the use of various bias-sense detection modes, the device is able to detect both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields within a single compact structure. In addition, the offset can be significantly reduced by one to three orders of magnitude by employing the current-spinning method. The device presented in this work demonstrated high in-plane and out-of-plane current- and voltage-related sensitivities ranging between 64.1 to 198 V A$^{-1}$ T$^{-1}$ and 14.8 to 21.4 mV V$^{-1}$ T$^{-1}$, with crosstalk below 3.7 %. The sensor exhibits a thermal noise floor which corresponds to approximately 0.5 $\\mu$T/$\\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1.31 V supply. This novel Hall-effect sensor represents a promising and simpler alternative to existing state-of-the-art 3-axis magnetic sensors, offering a viable solution for precise and reliable magnetic field sensing in various applications such as position feedback and power monitoring.

    "abstract": "           While there is much indirect evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), to date it has evaded detection. Current efforts focus on DM masses over $\\sim$GeV -- to push the sensitivity of DM searches to lower masses, new DM targets and detection schemes are needed. In this work, we focus on the latter - a novel detection scheme recently proposed to detect ~10-100 meV phonons in polar target materials. Previous work showed that well-motivated models of DM can interact with polar semiconductors to produce an athermal population of phonons. This new sensing scheme proposes that these phonons then facilitate quantum evaporation of $^3$He from a van der Waals film deposited on the target material. However, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still unclear, with several uncertainties related to the precise rate of evaporation and how it can be controlled. In this work, we use \\textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare the adsorption energies of helium atoms on a polar target material, sodium iodide (NaI), to understand the underlying evaporation physics. We explore the role of surface termination, monolayer coverage and elemental species on the rate of He evaporation from the target material. Using this, we discuss the optimal target features for He-evaporation experiments and their range of tunability through chemical and physical modifications such as applied field and surface termination.

    "abstract": "           The numerical simulation and optimization of technical systems described by partial differential equations is expensive, especially in multi-query scenarios in which the underlying equations have to be solved for different parameters. A comparatively new approach in this context is to combine the good approximation properties of neural networks (for parameter dependence) with the classical finite element method (for discretization). However, instead of considering the solution mapping of the PDE from the parameter space into the FEM-discretized solution space as a purely data-driven regression problem, so-called physically informed regression problems have proven to be useful. In these, the equation residual is minimized during the training of the neural network, i.e. the neural network \"learns\" the physics underlying the problem. In this paper, we extend this approach to saddle-point and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, respectively, namely stationary Stokes and stationary Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we propose a modification of the existing approach: Instead of minimizing the plain vanilla equation residual during training, we minimize the equation residual modified by a preconditioner. By analogy with the linear case, this also improves the condition in the present non-linear case. Our numerical examples demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the training effort and greatly increases accuracy and generalizability. Finally, we show the application of the resulting parameterized model to a related inverse problem.         ",

This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.

    "abstract": "           Understanding the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules induced by light-matter interactions is crucial for potential applications of photochemical processes, but it is challenging due to the high computational costs of exact quantum dynamics simulations. Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for exact quantum dynamics simulations by exploiting the quantum nature of the computational device. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. In this work, we present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.         ",

    "abstract": "           Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, \\citet{Niraula2022} pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this Letter, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use the perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\\sim$10\\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ presents a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily driven by the observation of gas giants) at $\\sim$4.3$\\mu$m and yet severely lack opacity data. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$ ~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements. Our proof-of-concept introduces a computationally affordable way to compute full-dimensional interaction potentials and scattering quantum dynamics with a precision sufficient to reduce the model-limited biases originating from the pressure broadening and thus support instrument-limited science with JWST and future missions.

    "abstract": "           Integrated frequency comb generators based on Kerr parametric oscillation have led to chip-scale, gigahertz-spaced combs with new applications spanning hyperscale telecommunications, low-noise microwave synthesis, LiDAR, and astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Recent progress in lithium niobate (LN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has resulted in chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs, offering precise comb-line positioning and simple operation without relying on the formation of dissipative Kerr solitons. However, current integrated EO combs face limited spectral coverage due to the large microwave power required to drive the non-resonant capacitive electrodes and the strong intrinsic birefringence of Lithium Niobate. Here, we overcome both challenges with an integrated triply resonant architecture, combining monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with PICs based on the recently emerged thin-film lithium tantalate. With resonantly enhanced EO interaction and reduced birefringence in Lithium Tantalate, we achieve a four-fold comb span extension and a 16-fold power reduction compared to the conventional non-resonant microwave design. Driven by a hybrid-integrated laser diode, the comb spans over 450nm (60THz) with >2000 lines, and the generator fits within a compact 1cm^2 footprint. We additionally observe that the strong EO coupling leads to an increased comb existence range approaching the full free spectral range of the optical microresonator. The ultra-broadband comb generator, combined with detuning-agnostic operation, could advance chip-scale spectrometry and ultra-low-noise millimeter wave synthesis and unlock octave-spanning EO combs. The methodology of co-designing microwave and optical resonators can be extended to a wide range of integrated electro-optics applications.         ",

Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.

    "abstract": "           Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.         ",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their low mass, are excellent candidates for suspended membranes to provide high sensitivity, small footprint sensors. The present work demonstrates pressure sensors employing large-scale-synthesized 2D platinum diselenide (PtSe${_2}$) films as piezoresistive membranes supported only by a thin polymer layer. We investigate three different synthesis methods with contrasting growth parameters and establish a reliable high yield fabrication process for suspended PtSe${_2}$/PMMA membranes across sealed cavities. The pressure sensors reproducibly display sensitivities above 6 x 10${^4}$ kPa${^{-1}}$. We show that the sensitivity clearly depends on the membrane diameter and the piezoresistive gauge factor of the PtSe${_2}$ film. Reducing the total device size by decreasing the number of membranes within a device leads to a significant increase in the area-normalized sensitivity. This allows the manufacturing of pressure sensors with high sensitivity but a much smaller device footprint than the current state-of-the-art MEMS technology. We further integrate PtSe${_2}$ pressure sensors with CMOS technology, improving the technological readiness of PtSe${_2}$-based MEMS and NEMS devices.         ",
