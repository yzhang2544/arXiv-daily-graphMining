We introduce a new nonlinear reconstruction algorithm, ``Planck regression,\" that reconstructs the temperature map from a grayscale sensor image, even in the presence of severe chromatic aberration, by exploiting blackbody and optical physics particular to thermal imaging. We combine this algorithm with an end-to-end approach that optimizes a manufacturable, single-layer metasurface to yield the most accurate reconstruction. Our designs demonstrate high-quality, noise-robust reconstructions of arbitrary temperature maps (including completely random images) in simulations of an ultra-compact thermal-imaging device. We also show that Planck regression is much more generalizable to arbitrary images than a straightforward neural-network reconstruction, which requires a large training set of domain-specific images.

    "abstract": "           In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the spectrometer is a fundamental component of MRI systems, responsible for the transmission of radiofrequency (RF) pulses that excite hydrogen nuclei and the subsequent acquisition of MR signals for processing. However, detailed knowledge about this component remains largely inaccessible due to the proprietary nature of commercial systems. To address this gap, we present an FPGA-based platform specifically designed for MRI signal transmission and reception in low-field MRI applications. Additionally, with appropriate chip replacements, this platform can be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems. This platform leverages Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technology to generate RF pulses, offering the flexibility to quickly and precisely adjust soft pulse parameters to meet the specific requirements of the MRI system. Additionally, the platform processes MRI signals through digital downconversion techniques and utilizes CIC and FIR filters to obtain baseband signals. Experimental testing of this platform has yielded promising results. We hope that this work will inspire further research and development in the field of MRI spectrometer design. Furthermore, it is worth noting that with the replacement of relevant chips, this system can also be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Ionising radiation interactions in matter can trigger a cascade of processes that underpin long-lived damage in the medium. To date, however, a lack of suitable methodologies has precluded our ability to understand the role that material nanostructure plays in this cascade. Here, we use transient photoabsorption to track the lifetime of free electrons (t_c) in bulk and nanostructured SiO2 (aerogel) irradiated by picosecond-scale (10^-12 s) bursts of X-rays and protons from a laser-driven accelerator. Optical streaking reveals a sharp increase in t_c from < 1 ps to > 50 ps over a narrow average density (p_av) range spanning the expected phonon-fracton crossover in aerogels. Numerical modelling suggests that this discontinuity can be understood by a quenching of rapid, phonon-assisted recovery in irradiated nanostructured SiO_2. This is shown to lead to an extended period of enhanced energy density in the excited electron population. Overall, these results open a direct route to tracking how low-level processes in complex systems can underpin macroscopically observed phenomena and, importantly, the conditions that permit them to emerge.

    "abstract": "           An essential requirement for universal quantum control of the centre-of-mass motion of levitated objects is the development of a precise readout of all three translational degrees of freedom. Improving that precision presents one key challenge: collecting all the information on the object's position, encoded in the scattered light, equivalent to minimising the measurement imprecision. Here, we propose a new detection technique based on spatial mode decomposition, which addresses this problem using a simple integrated setup, where all of the light back-scattered from a levitated nanoparticle couples into a spatial mode sorter. We observe that each mode of the sorter pairs predominantly to the in-elastically scattered field generated by the object's motion along a particular spatial axis. This results in each translational degree of freedom being selectively encoded in the amplitude of orthogonal information channels. Using this approach, we report measurement efficiencies ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{tot}}^x$, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{tot}}^y$, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{tot}}^z$) = (0.17, 0.15, 0.30), implying that our technique is capable of reaching the 3D quantum ground state.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computation for chemical problems will require the construction of guiding states with sufficient overlap with a target state. Since easily available and initializable mean-field states are characterized by an overlap that is reduced for multi-configurational electronic structures and even vanishes with growing system size, we here investigate the severity of state preparation for reaction chemistry. We emphasize weaknesses in current traditional approaches (even for weakly correlated molecules) and highlight the advantage of quantum phase estimation algorithms. An important result is the introduction of a new classification scheme for electronic structures based on orbital entanglement information. We identify two categories of multi-configurational molecules. Whereas class-1 molecules are dominated by very few determinants and often found in reaction chemistry, class-2 molecules do not allow one to single out a reasonably sized number of important determinants. The latter are particularly hard for traditional approaches and an ultimate target for quantum computation. Some open-shell iron-sulfur clusters belong to class 2. We discuss the role of the molecular orbital basis set and show that true class-2 molecules remain in this class independent of the choice of the orbital basis, with the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase being a prototypical example. We stress that class-2 molecules can be build in a systematic fashion from open-shell centers or unsaturated carbon atoms. Our key result is that it will always be possible to initialize a guiding state for chemical reaction chemistry in the ground state based on initial low-cost approximate electronic structure information, which is facilitated by the finite size of the atomistic structures to be considered.

We prove this by integrating SNSPDs and showing through-waveguide single-photon detection in commercially manufactured silicon and lithium niobate on insulator integrated photonic circuits.

Multiple approaches have been introduced to achieve such goals, typically obtrusive and non-obtrusive. Amongst the obtrusive approaches are the wearable devices, and among the non-obtrusive approaches are the movement detection systems, including motion sensors and thermal sensor arrays (TSAs). TSA systems are advantageous when preserving a person's privacy and picking his precise spatial location. In this study, human daily living activities were monitored day and night, constructing the corresponding activity time series and spatial probability distribution and employing a TSA system. The monitored activities are classified into two categories: sleeping and daily activity. Results showed the possibility of distinguishing between classes regardless of day and night. The obtained sleep activity duration was compared with previous research using the same raw data. Results showed that the duration of sleep activity, on average, was 9 hours/day, and daily life activity was 7 hours/day. The person's spatial probability distribution was determined using the bivariate distribution for the monitored location. In conclusion, the results showed that sleeping activity was dominant. Our study showed that TSAs were the optimum choice when monitoring human activity.

    "abstract": "           Out-of-equilibrium fermionic quantum impurity models (QIM), describing a small interacting system coupled to a continuous fermionic bath, play an important role in condensed matter physics. Solving such models is a computationally demanding task, and a variety of computational approaches are based on finding approximate representations of the bath by a finite number of modes. In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding efficient bath representations as that of approximating a kernel of the bath's Feynman-Vernon influence functional by a sum of complex exponentials, with each term defining a fermionic pseudomode. Under mild assumptions on the analytic properties of the bath spectral density, we provide an analytic construction of pseudomodes, and prove that their number scales polylogarithmically with the maximum evolution time $T$ and the approximation error $\\varepsilon$. We then demonstrate that the number of pseudomodes can be significantly reduced by an interpolative matrix decomposition (ID). Furthermore, we present a complementary approach, based on constructing rational approximations of the bath's spectral density using the ``AAA'' algorithm, followed by compression with ID. The combination of two approaches yields a pseudomode count scaling as $N_\\text{ID} \\sim \\log(T)\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$, and the agreement between the two approches suggests that the result is close to optimal. Finally, to relate our findings to QIM, we derive an explicit Liouvillian that describes the time evolution of the combined impurity-pseudomodes system. These results establish bounds on the computational resources required for solving out-of-equilibrium QIMs, providing an efficient starting point for tensor-network methods for QIMs.         ",

This endeavor is motivated by the higher densities, which can be expected from hydrogen compared to neutrons, the easier access, the fact that GQS were never observed with atoms and the accessibility to hypothetical short range interactions. In addition to enabling gravitational quantum spectroscopy, such a cryogenic hydrogen beam with very low vertical velocity components - a few cm s$^{-1}$, can be used for precision optical and microwave spectroscopy.

In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Identical systems, or entities, are indistinguishable in quantum mechanics (QM), and the symmetrization postulate rules the possible statistical distributions of a large number of identical quantum entities. However, a thorough analysis on the historical development of QM attributes the origin of quantum statistics, in particular, Bose-Einstein statistics, to a lack of statistical independence of the micro-states of identical quantum entities. We have recently identified Bose-Einstein statistics in the combination of words in large texts, as a consequence of the entanglement created by the meaning carried by words when they combine in human language. Relying on this investigation, we put forward the hypothesis that entanglement, hence the lack of statistical independence, is due to a mechanism of contextual updating, which provides deeper reasons for the appearance of Bose-Einstein statistics in human language. However, this investigation also contributes to a better understanding of the origin of quantum mechanical statistics in physics. Finally, we provide new insights into the intrinsically random behaviour of microscopic entities that is generally assumed within classical statistical mechanics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.

    "abstract": "           Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.         ",
