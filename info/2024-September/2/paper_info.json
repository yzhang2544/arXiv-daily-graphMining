Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.

We demonstrate the correctness and applicability of the technique by computing alchemical free energy changes of gas-phase molecules, with both nuclear and electron creation/annihilation.

We consider the \"prolate-type\" asymmetryic top molecules with the asymmetry parameters $-1 < \\kappa < 0$ and the C2v symmetry in the low-temperature limiting case, which are aligned by using mutually orthogonal linearly polarized double laser pulses. The landscape map for each molecule consists of 6000 pixels, each pixel of which represents the maximum degree of alignment achieved by each set of control parameters. After examining ways to deal with the markedly different molecular parameters in a unified manner for suitably training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we train the CNN model by using 55 training sample molecules to predict the control landscape maps of 35 test sample molecules with reasonably high accuracy. As the predicted landscape maps provide a big picture of the alignment control, we show, for example, that the double pulse control scheme is especially effective for a molecule having a polarizability component that is much larger in value than the other two components.

Current micro-acoustic resonator technology, a key component in radiofrequency front end filters, is struggling to keep pace with these developments. This work presents a novel acoustic resonator architecture enabling multi-frequency, low-loss, and wideband filtering for the 5G and future 6G bands located above 3 GHz. Thanks to the exceptional performance of these resonators, filters for the 5G n77 and n79 bands are demonstrated, exhibiting fractional bandwidths of 13% and 25% respectively with low insertion loss of around 1 dB.

    "abstract": "           We demonstrate that periodically driven quantum rotors provide a promising and broadly applicable platform to implement multi-gap topological phases, where groups of bands can acquire topological invariants due to non-Abelian braiding of band degeneracies. By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.

    "abstract": "           Calorimetric determination of enthalpies of mixing ($\\Delta$H$_{\\rm mix}$) of multicomponent molten salts often employs empirical models that lack parameters with clear physical interpretation (e.g., coordination numbers, molar volumes, and pair potentials). Although such physics informed models are not always needed, a thermodynamic understanding of the relationships between excess energies of mixing and local to intermediate solvation structures is particularly important for pyrochemical separation, as is the case for lanthanides (Ln), which are common neutron poisons and critical industrial elements found in spent nuclear fuels. Here we implement the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) to synthesize information from experimentally measured $\\Delta$H$_{\\rm mix}$ (using high temperature melt drop calorimetry) and the distribution of solvation structures from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This was demonstrated by a case study of molten salt system consisted of LaCl$_3$ mixing with a eutectic LiCl-KCl (58mol% to 42mol%) at 873 K and 1133 K. The parameters modelled from MIVM were used to extrapolate excess Gibbs energy ($\\Delta$G$_{\\rm mix}$), and compositional dependence of La$^{3+}$ activity in the LaCl$_3$-(LiCl-KCl) system. In contrast, by AIMD or polarizable ion model (PIM) simulations, a significant deviation regarding the predicted $\\Delta$H$_{\\rm mix}$ was seen if computed directly from the molecular dynamic trajectories. The integrated experimental and simulation data within the MIVM formalism are generalizable to a wide variety of molten salts and demonstrate a significant improvement over currently employed methods to study molten salts for nuclear and separations sciences.

Traditional machine learning is expected to accelerate the optimization of FET design, yet its application in this field is limited by the lack of both high-fidelity datasets and the integration of physical knowledge. Here, we introduced a physics-integrated neural network framework to predict the transport curves of sub-5-nm gate-all-around (GAA) FETs using an in-house developed high-fidelity database. The transport curves in the database are collected from literature and our first-principles calculations. Beyond silicon, we included indium arsenide, indium phosphide, and selenium nanowires with different structural phases as the FET channel materials. Then, we built a physical-knowledge-integrated hyper vector neural network (PHVNN), in which five new physical features were added into the inputs for prediction transport characteristics, achieving a sufficiently low mean absolute error of 0.39. In particular, ~98% of the current prediction residuals are within one order of magnitude. Using PHVNN, we efficiently screened out the symmetric p-type GAA FETs that possess the same figures of merit with the n-type ones, which are crucial for the fabrication of homogeneous CMOS circuits. Finally, our automatic differentiation analysis provides interpretable insights into the PHVNN, which highlights the important contributions of our new input parameters and improves the reliability of PHVNN. Our approach provides an effective method for rapidly screening appropriate GAA FETs with the prospect of accelerating the design process of next-generation electronic devices.         ",

We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strongly coupled vacuum mode induces polarization rotation in the linear scattering, which is incompatible with a linear polarizability model of isotropic objects.

By highlighting the role of the polarization field in reshaping the spin and orbit potentials, we reveal in this work the characteristics and underlying mechanism in the relatively simpler OEC evolutions within the states S0 - S2 prior to the water oxidation. The characteristic shifts of the density of states (DOS) of the electron donor Mn atom are observed in the vicinity of the Fermi surface to occur with the spin flips of Mn atoms and the change of the Mn oxidation states during the electron transfer. Notably, the spin flips of Mn atoms point to the resulting spin configuration of the next states. It is found that the electron transfer tend to stabilize the catalyst OEC itself, whereas the proton transfer pushes the evolution forward by preparing a new electron donor, demonstrating the proton-coupled electron transfer. Meanwhile, it shows that the Mn-O bonds around the candidate Mn atom of the electron donor undergo characteristic changes in the bond lengths during the electron transfer. These concomitant phenomena uncovered in first-principle calculations characterize the essential equilibrium of the OEC between the state evolution and stability that forms a ground of the dynamic OEC cycles. In particular, the characteristic undulation of the DOS around the Fermi level occurring at the proton-coupled electron transfer can be used to reveal crucial processes in a wide range of realistic systems.

    "abstract": "           The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis of the model shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe the contribution of recombination to the device response. The influence of local electrostatics on non-radiative trap-mediated and Auger recombination becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model of non-radiative recombination, for which transistors gated by the local change in electrostatic potential implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence the small signal electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant to a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.         ",
