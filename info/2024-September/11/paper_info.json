    "abstract": "           Kramers-Kronig (KK) analysis has been widely used to extract the optical conductivity spectrum from a broad range of reflectance spectrum obtained from far-infrared to ultraviolet frequency ranges. In this study, we present how measurement uncertainty in the reflectivity spectrum affects the extracted optical conductivity spectrum obtained through KK analysis. We consider realistic uncertainties that can easily occur in reflectance measurement environments: (1) a rigid shift of the absolute reflectance in the whole measurement frequency window, and (2) a linear decrement of reflectance with increasing frequency. Our investigation reveals that the reliability of the extracted optical conductivity spectrum, especially in the lower-frequency range, should be carefully addressed, particularly when the reflectance is above approximately 95 %.

However, numerous challenges remain, including improving their depletion depth and identifying effective methods to calculate per-pixel gain conversion. We have tested a commercial Sony IMX290LLR CMOS sensor under X-ray light using an $^{55}$Fe radioactive source and collected X-ray photons for $\\sim$15 consecutive days under stable conditions at regulated temperatures of 21\u00b0C and 26\u00b0C. At each temperature, the data set contained enough X-ray photons to produce one spectrum per pixel consisting only of single-pixel events. We determined the gain dispersion of its 2.1 million pixels using the peak fitting and the Energy Calibration by Correlation (ECC) methods. We measured a gain dispersion of 0.4\\% at both temperatures and demonstrated the advantage of the ECC method in the case of spectra with low statistics. The energy resolution at 5.9 keV after the per-pixel gain correction is improved by $\\gtrsim$10 eV for single-pixel and all event spectra, with single-pixel event energy resolution reaching $123.6\\pm 0.2$ eV, close to the Fano limit of silicon sensors at room temperature. Finally, our long data acquisition demonstrated the excellent stability of the detector over more than 30 days under a flux of $10^4$ photons per second.         ",

Here we demonstrate the use of a mid-infrared, frequency agile optical frequency comb as the coupling laser for three-photon Rydberg atom electrometry. This approach allows us to simultaneously prepare as many as seven individual Rydberg states, allowing for multichannel detection across a frequency range from 1 GHz to 40 GHz.

Here, we present an optical neural engine (ONE) architecture combining diffractive optical neural networks for Fourier space processing and optical crossbar structures for real space processing to solve time-dependent and time-independent PDEs in diverse disciplines, including Darcy flow equation, the magnetostatic Poisson equation in demagnetization, the Navier-Stokes equation in incompressible fluid, Maxwell's equations in nanophotonic metasurfaces, and coupled PDEs in a multiphysics system. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capability of the ONE architecture, which not only leverages the advantages of high-performance dual-space processing for outperforming traditional PDE solvers and being comparable with state-of-the-art ML models but also can be implemented using optical computing hardware with unique features of low-energy and highly parallel constant-time processing irrespective of model scales and real-time reconfigurability for tackling multiple tasks with the same architecture.

The framework comprises two main components: computing the fundamental bound using the semi-definite relaxation and finding a realizable solution via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. The embedded element patterns are subject to the optimization with two distinct goals under study: focusing the radiation in a single direction or synthesizing patterns with desired shapes. The reactive terminations of passive antenna elements serve as optimization variables. We demonstrate the framework using a connected bowtie-slot antenna and antenna array with both beam-focusing and beam-shaping targets. The tests show that the optimization on the Riemannian manifold yields superior results compared to existing methods, such as the genetic algorithm. This is particularly evident in the most complex and extensive problem, which requires the synthesis of shaped embedded element patterns for a sparse reactively loaded antenna array with a limited field of view.

Zero back-scattering is achieved due to generalized Kerker effect and multipole cancellation condition. We found a set of geometries and shapes of the nanoantenna having back-scattering intensity close to zero. With help of clustering algorithms, all the found geometries fall separated into several groups according to their multipolar content. While the optical properties of scatterers in each group were similar due to similar multipolar content, their shapes can be significantly different which stresses the ambiguity of free-form optimization problem.

We report on protocol for the direct optical activation of split-vacancy color centers in diamond via localized processing with continuous wave laser at mW optical powers. We demonstrate the activation of photoluminescent Mg- and Sn-related centers at both the ensemble and single-photon emitter level in ion-implanted, high-purity diamond crystals without further thermal processing.

The strong dependence of viscosity on temperature and pressure leads to the appearance of a hump with reduced density. This hydrodynamic model for laser swelling is formulated in general form. We present a 1D solution for laser swelling of a thin glassy polymer film on a strongly thermally conductive substrate for laser pulses long enough that the sound confinement effect can be neglected. It is shown that within this condition the evolution of the film thickness over time can be addressed using a second-order ordinary differential equation. It is also shown that in some cases this equation can be reduced to a first-order differential equation resembling the phenomenological equation of the previously published relaxation model of laser swelling. The main features of the dependence of laser swelling on laser fluence, namely the threshold at low fluencies and saturation at high fluencies, have been clarified allowing for the dependence of viscosity on pressure, which was not taken into account in the previous theoretical studies of laser swelling. Typical regimes of the film thickness evolution are considered and compared to existing experimental data.         ",

    "abstract": "           A resonant electro-optic (EO) frequency comb is generated through electro-optic modulation of laser light within an optical resonator. Compared to cavity-less EO combs generated in a single pass through a modulator, resonant EO combs can produce broader spectra with lower radio frequency (RF) power and offer a measure of noise filtering beyond the cavity's linewidth. Understanding, measuring, and suppressing the sources of phase noise in resonant EO combs is crucial for their applications in metrology, astrophotonics, optical clock generation, and fiber-optic communication. According to the standard phase noise model of frequency combs, only two variables - the common mode offset and repetition rate phase noise - are needed to fully describe the phase noise of comb lines. However, in this work we demonstrate analytically, numerically, and experimentally that this standard model breaks down for resonant EO combs at short timescales (high frequencies) and under certain comb parameters. Specifically, a third phase noise component emerges. Consequently, resonant EO combs feature qualitatively different phase noise from their cavity-less counterparts and may not exhibit the anticipated noise filtering. A more complete description of the deviations from the standard phase noise model is critical to accurately predict the performance of frequency combs. The description presented here paves the way for improved designs tailored to applications such as super-continuum generation and optical communication.         ",

At low optical density of the atomic cloud the intensity distribution of light in the cavity is ruled by the cavity's mode function, which is solely determined by its geometry. In this regime the dynamics of the coupled atom-cavity system is conveniently described by the open Dicke model, which we apply to calculating normal mode splitting generated by periodically ordered clouds in linear and ring cavities. We also show how to use normal mode splitting as witness for Wannier-Bloch oscillations in the tight-binding limit. At high optical density the atomic distribution contributes to shaping the mode function. This regime escapes the open Dicke model, but can be treated by a transfer matrix model provided the saturation parameter is low. Applying this latter model to an atomic cloud periodically ordered into a one-dimensional lattice, we observe the formation of photonic bands gaps competing with the normal mode splitting. We discuss the limitations of both models and point out possible pathways to generalized theories.         ",

    "title": "Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study",
    "abstract": "           The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.

    "title": "Inverse-design of high-dimensional quantum optical circuits in a complex medium",
    "abstract": "           Programmable optical circuits form a key part of quantum technologies today, ranging from transceivers for quantum communication to integrated photonic chips for quantum information processing. As the size of such circuits is increased, maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging, leading to a reduction in the quality of the operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we show how embedding an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability over the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear optical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial multi-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these circuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show how their programmability allows us to turn the multi-mode fibre itself into a generalised multi-outcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. Finally, we discuss the scalability of our approach, numerically showing how a high circuit fidelity can be achieved with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode-mixer. Our work serves as an alternative yet powerful approach for realising precise control over high-dimensional quantum states of light, with clear applications in next-generation quantum communication and computing technologies.

    "title": "Evaluating a quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with Matchgate shadows",
    "abstract": "           Solving the electronic structure problem of molecules and solids to high accuracy is a major challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.

    "title": "Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "           Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.         ",

Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD.
