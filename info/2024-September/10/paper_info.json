    "title": "A physical perspective on lithium therapy",
    "abstract": "           Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and primary headaches, and has recently gathered attention due to its preventive effect on viral attacks. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade already in the late 1940s, the underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. The therapeutic effect is achieved through long-term exposure to lower doses, where it, opposite to acute doses, alleviates excessive cellular activity, and induces a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. This review investigates how lithium ions affect membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability, and ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.

    "abstract": "           Research suggests that acoustic technology may be able to detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos if a large amount of non-linear fluid is analyzed. When a neutrino interacts in water, it creates a quasi-instantaneous cascade of particles, heating that region of the fluid and emitting a tiny acoustic signal. This rapid heating produces a thermoacoustic Bipolar Pulse (BP) with unique characteristics such as a wide bandwidth and a narrow directivity for these frequencies. While dedicated devices for acoustic neutrino detection are currently non-existent, there are a few underwater neutrino telescopes that utilize optical technology, but often with an acoustic positioning system that deploys hydrophones in the infrastructure. The possibility of using them to study a BP caused by a neutrino interaction is currently being discussed. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a trigger system to detect a possible BP in deep-sea hydrophones. For this, up to 24 hours of the raw acoustic signal recorded by the O$\\nu$DE-2 station, which was located 25 km off-shore from Catania in the Western Ionian Sea, at 2100 m depth, is analyzed. The station used calibrated hydrophones from a few Hz to 70 kHz. In this work, a synthetic BP is created and added to the experimental data, allowing the study of its detection and the calculation of precision and recall.         ",

    "abstract": "           The accuracy of high precision and fundamental measurements of atomic transition frequencies via laser spectroscopy depends upon fitting the spectral data with a lineshape. With atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen 1S-2S two-photon spectroscopy, computer intensive Monte-Carlo simulations have been used to compute the optical Bloch equations in order to match and interpret the experimental spectra. For the highest resolutions, one tries to minimize saturation effects going to regimes of low excitation probability, where perturbation theory can provide reliable results. Here we describe an analytical approach to the lineshape based on perturbation theory accounting for the AC-Stark shift and ionization. The expressions can be used for beam experiments or integrated over the magnetic field profile for a trapped sample. Theses lineshapes, providing fast results, allow for studies of many systematic effects that influence the accuracy of the determination of the central frequency. This development has relevance to hydrogen beam experiments and to trapped hydrogen and antihydrogen, as developed by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN, for tests of the CPT-symmetry and the highest accuracy measurement on antimatter.

Although it has been suggested that a series of progressively sophisticated tests using artificial intelligence could yield increasingly significant experimental data to constrain potential resolutions to the measurement problem, no feasible experimental designs have yet been proposed. In this work, we utilize advanced deep learning technology to develop a novel experimental framework that integrates neural network-based artificial intelligence into a Bell test. This framework challenges the implicit assumptions underlying Bell tests. We demonstrate our framework through a simulation and introduce three new metric-morphing polygons, averaged Shannon entropy, and probability density map-to analyze the results. This approach enables us to determine whether quantum probability aligns with any one of these three interpretations or a hybrid of them.         ",

We discuss a class of states that exist at any value of the coupling, and whose properties such as mass, electric and magnetic charges, and spin quantum numbers can be precisely characterised at low energies. The low-energy theory is best presented as a one-dimensional complex manifold, equipped with metric and other structures: namely, the space of low-energy vacua, covered by three open regions that are interpreted as macroscopic phases.

The TMOKE amplitude can be tailored by manipulating the perturbation parameter, and it can reach as high as 1.978, approaching the theoretical maximum value of 2. Additionally, a single-mode temporal coupled-mode theory is employed to further reveal the underlying physical mechanism. It is found that TMOKE is strongly related to the line width of the quasi-BIC resonance and local field enhancement, which are pivotal factors in the design and optimization of photonic devices. As a potential application, we design and numerically demonstrate a refractive index sensor based on the resonantly enhanced TMOKE, with the optimal sensitivity of 110.66 nm/RIU and the corresponding maximum figure of merit of 299.3 RIU$^{-1}$. Our work provides a simple and efficient approach for enhancing TMOKE based on an easy-to-fabricate platform, laying the groundwork for exploring and developing magneto-optical devices such as sensors, magnetic storage devices, and nonreciprocal photonic devices.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the evolution of the zonal flows and their sustainability. Based on studies in two-dimensional (2D) $\\beta$ plane setups, zonal flow is believed to be forced at the intermediate scale via baroclinic instabilities, and the inverse cascade leads to the transfer of energy to large scales. However, whether such a process exists in three-dimensional (3D) deep convection systems remains an open and challenging question. To explore a possible answer, we perform Large Eddy Simulations at the geophysically interesting regime of $Ra=$$10^{12}$, $Ek=$$10^{-6}$,$10^{-7}$ and $10^{-8}$ in horizontally rotating Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection setup and discover the existence of natural forcing through buoyancy and inverse cascade.

The TWT performance is evaluated via particle-in-cell simulations that reveal a 3-dB bandwidth of approximately 12 GHz spanning from 54.5 GHz to 66.3 GHz, accompanied by a maximum gain of 23 dB. Because of GS, the backward wave in the first spatial harmonic is not longitudinally polarized, leading to a low risk of backward wave oscillations in the TWT.

    "abstract": "           The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.

    "abstract": "           We employ an optical fiber doped with randomly oriented fluorescent sub-micron diamonds and the novel zero-field resonance protocol to collect information on the localization and orientation of a magnetic-field source and its distribution. Many previous demonstrations of diamond-based magnetic field sensing achieved ultrahigh sensitivities down to the fT range warranted by manipulating spin states of the diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with externally applied radio or microwaves. The application of such oscillating fields is problematic in distributed magnetic-field measurements and may be incompatible with specific targets. Instead of relying on these approaches, we leveraged cross-relaxations of particular spin-state populations of the NV center under a magnetic field, thus observing zero-field resonances and making external radio frequency fields redundant. Combined with an optical fiber sensitive to the magnetic field along its entire length, remote sensing was realized that returned information on the spatial field distribution without using any moving mechanical elements in the detection system. Variation of the spatial parameters of the investigated field was achieved simply by controlling the current in a pair of induction coils easily integrable with optical fibers without limiting the fiber-specific functionality of the optical readout taking place at a fixed location at the optical fiber output. Lifting of the requirements related to the mechanical scanning of the fiber, the application of external fields, and the orientation of the NV centers against the measured field mark a very practical step forward in optically driven magnetic field sensing, not easily achievable with earlier implementations.

    "abstract": "           Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -> 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -> 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.         ",

The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.

By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.

Here, we present a solution by achieving polarization engineering of frequency-nondegenerate biphotons emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in GaAs metasurfaces, where quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances were utilized for boosting the biphoton generation. By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization. This work provides a significant step towards utilizing metasurfaces to not only generate quantum light but also engineer their polarization, a critical aspect for future quantum technologies.

These collective states are potentially important in the context of single photon sources, optical transistor, all-optical quantum gates and fast read-out of quantum information. However progress in Rydberg polariton quantum technology has been hindered by fast motional dephasing on which no effective methods exist for undoing it.

This theoretical concept, dubbed as 'tomographic Fermi liquid', is yet challenging to test with dc electrical measurements as electron scattering weakly affects the electrical resistivity. Here, we show that linewidth and amplitude of electromagnetic absorption at the multiple harmonics of the cyclotron resonance carries all necessary information to test the tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis. Namely, the height and inverse width of $m$-th order cyclotron resonance ($m \\ge 2$) is proportional to the lifetime of $m$-th angular harmonic of electron distribution function $\\tau_m$, if probed at wavelengths exceeding the cyclotron radius $R_c$. Measurements of high-order cyclotron resonance at short wavelengths order of $R_c$ also enable a direct determination of all lifetimes $\\tau_m$ from a simple linear system of equations that we hereby derive. Extraction of cyclotron resonance lifetimes from an experiment on terahertz photoconductivity in graphene shows that third-order resonance is systematically narrower than second-order one, supporting the prediction of tomographic Fermi liquid hypothesis.

In this contribution, we present a general approach for the simulation of the optical response of multi-chromophore systems in a structured environment and its implementation as a quantum algorithm. A key step of the procedure is the pseudomode embedding of the system-environment problem resulting in a finite set of quantum states evolving according to a Markovian quantum master equation. This formulation is then solved by a collision model integrated into a quantum algorithm designed to simulate linear and nonlinear response functions. The workflow is validated by simulating spectra for the prototypical excitonic dimer interacting with fast (memoryless) and finite-memory environments. The results demonstrate, on the one hand, the potential of the pseudomode embedding for simulating the dynamical features of nonlinear spectroscopy, including lineshape, spectral diffusion, and relaxations along delay times. On the other hand, the explicit synthesis of quantum circuits provides a fully quantum simulation protocol of nonlinear spectroscopy harnessing the efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics promised by the future generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following such a framework, we for the first time fabricated a broadband VIS-NIR (400-1700 nm) hyperspectral imaging sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024*1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams, and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems.

    "title": "The Ontology of Compositeness Within Quantum Field Theory",
    "abstract": "           In this work, we attempt to define a notion of compositeness compatible with Quantum Field Theory. Considering the analytic properties of the S-matrix, we conclude that there is no satisfactory definition of compositeness compatible with Quantum Field Theory. Without this notion, one must claim that all bound states are equally fundamental, that is, one cannot rigorously claim that everyday objects are made of atoms or that atoms are made of protons and neutrons. I then show how an approximate notion of compositeness may be recovered in the regime where the mass of a bound state is close to a multi-particle threshold. Finally, we see that rejecting compositeness solves several of the \"problems of everyday objects\" encountered in an undergraduate metaphysics course.         ",

By solving the coupled-channel equations with hyperfine and Zeeman interactions omitted at short range, the extended theory enables a drastically simplified description of the intricate quantum dynamics of ultracold molecular collisions in terms of a small number of short-range parameters. We apply the formalism to ultracold Mg + NH collisions in a magnetic field, achieving a 10$^4$-fold reduction in computational effort.         ",

    "abstract": "           Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.         ",

Building on the method presented in S. Wald \\ea, Appl.

We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $>23\\,\\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\\,\\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\\circ\\rm C$.

The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.         ",

Using locally addressed excited-state Stark shifts to tune atoms out of resonance, we realize site-selective hyperfine-state cavity readout across a 10-site array. The state discrimination fidelity is 0.994(1) for one atom and 0.989(2) averaged over the entire array at a survival probability of 0.975(1). To further speed up array readout, we demonstrate adaptive search strategies utilizing global/subset checks. Finally, we demonstrate repeated rounds of classical error correction, showing exponential suppression of logical error and extending logical memory fivefold beyond the single-bit idling lifetime.
