    "abstract": "           When an excited electromagnetically open optical waveguide goes through a temporal transition of its material properties, it radiates to the ambient surroundings. In this letter, we explore this radiation and reveal, using asymptotic evaluation of path integral in the complex frequency (Laplace) plane, a peculiar space-time dependence of its frequency. Specifically, we derive an exact formula (Eq. (11)) for the instantaneous radiation frequency, which exhibits a chirp behavior with respect to time. This simple formula depends on the ambient properties and on the longitudinal wavenumber \\beta of the guided mode before the temporal transition but not on the specific waveguide structure or materials. In addition, we derive a t^(-3/2) decay rate of the radiative field on time. We verify our analytic results using full-wave simulations of a dispersive and lossy Indium Tin Oxide waveguide that undergoes smooth temporal long transitions over up to ~200 cycles at the initially guided mode frequency. Thus, these theoretical findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of general optical waveguides experiencing temporal transitions and provide a powerful tool for analyzing and designing such THz and optical setups, with potential use in sensing and imaging.

    "abstract": "           In order to relate nanoparticle properties to function, fast and detailed particle characterization, is needed. The ability to characterize nanoparticle samples using optical microscopy techniques has drastically improved over the past few decades; consequently, there are now numerous microscopy methods available for detailed characterization of particles with nanometric size. However, there is currently no ``one size fits all'' solution to the problem of nanoparticle characterization. Instead, since the available techniques have different detection limits and deliver related but different quantitative information, the measurement and analysis approaches need to be selected and adapted for the sample at hand. In this tutorial, we review the optical theory of single particle scattering and how it relates to the differences and similarities in the quantitative particle information obtained from commonly used microscopy techniques, with an emphasis on nanometric (submicron) sized dielectric particles. Particular emphasis is placed on how the optical signal relates to mass, size, structure, and material properties of the detected particles and to its combination with diffusivity-based particle sizing. We also discuss emerging opportunities in the wake of new technology development, with the ambition to guide the choice of measurement strategy based on various challenges related to different types of nanoparticle samples and associated analytical demands.

We perform a precision analysis of the direct and inverse cascades in shell models of turbulence, where the velocity field is a real-valued function. We calculate the leading hundred anomalous scaling exponents, the marginal probability distribution functions of the velocity field at different shells, as well as the correlations between different shells. We find that the structure functions in both cascades exhibit a linear Kolomogorov scaling in the inertial range. We argue that the underlying reason for having no intermittency, is the strong correlations between the velocity fields at different shells. We analyze the tails of velocity distribution functions, which offer new insights to the structure of fluid turbulence.         ",

Manifesting the intensity gradient as an optical torque to spin particles is of great fascination on both fundamental and practical sides but remains elusive. Here, we uncover the existence of the optical intensity-gradient torque in the interaction of light with chiral particles. Such a new type of torque derives from the interplay between chirality induced multipoles, which switches its direction for particles with opposite chirality. We show that this torque can be directly detected by a simple standing wave field, created with the interference of two counterpropagating plane-like waves. Our work offers a unique route to achieve rotational control of matter by tailoring the field intensity of Maxwell waves. It also establishes a framework that maps a remarkable connection among the optical forces and torques, across chiral to nonchiral.         ",

Using numerical simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method, we investigate how spin and orbital angular momenta influence the inhomogeneous energy absorption at the surface and generate twisted optical forces that can drive topographic reorganization. We show how different structured light fields can create intricate patterns with chiral features on a material surface. We emphasize the crucial role of polarization and spatial inhomogeneity of the light field in the generation of asymmetric torque forces that directly affect the surface dynamics. Our electromagnetic simulations show how vortex beams can be used to create chiral surface structures, expanding our knowledge of laser-generated periodic surface structures and opening up new possibilities for chiral surface engineering.

    "abstract": "           Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures, however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions. Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature. Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.

This time-bin interferometer comprises a sequence of birefringent crystals which produce pulses separated by 4.3\\,ps, all along a single optical axis. Ultrafast Kerr gating in an optical fiber is employed to time-demultiplex the output from the quantum walk. We measure one-, two-, and three-photon interference arising from various input state combinations, including a heralded single-photon state, a thermal state, and an attenuated coherent state at one or more input ports.

Currently available technologies in the SWIR rely on costly epitaxial semiconductors that are not monolithically integrated with CMOS electronics. Solution-processed quantum dots can address this challenge by enabling low-cost manufacturing and simple monolithic integration on silicon in a back-end-of-line (BEOL) process. To date, colloidal quantum dot (CQD) materials to access the SWIR are mostly based on lead sulfide (PbS) and mercury telluride (HgTe) compounds, imposing major regulatory concerns and impeding their deployment in consumer electronics due to toxicity concerns. Here we report a new synthesis method for environmentally-friendly silver telluride (Ag2Te) quantum dots and their application in high-performance SWIR photodetectors. The CQD photodetector stack employs materials compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substance (RoHS) directives and is sensitive in the spectral range from 350 nm - 1600 nm. The room-temperature detectivity is of the order 1012 Jones, the 3dB bandwidth is in excess of 0.1 MHz and the linear dynamic range is over 118 dB.

    "abstract": "           A resonant electro-optic (EO) frequency comb is generated through electro-optic modulation of laser light within an optical resonator. Compared to cavity-less EO combs generated in a single pass through a modulator, resonant EO combs can produce broader spectra with lower radio frequency (RF) power and offer a measure of noise filtering beyond the cavity's linewidth. Understanding, measuring, and suppressing the sources of phase noise in resonant EO combs is crucial for their applications in metrology, astrophotonics, optical clock generation, and fiber-optic communication. According to the standard phase noise model of frequency combs, only two variables - the common mode offset and repetition rate phase noise - are needed to fully describe the phase noise of comb lines. However, in this work we demonstrate analytically, numerically, and experimentally that this standard model breaks down for resonant EO combs at short timescales (high frequencies) and under certain comb parameters. Specifically, a third phase noise component emerges. Consequently, resonant EO combs feature qualitatively different phase noise from their cavity-less counterparts and may not exhibit the anticipated noise filtering. A more complete description of the deviations from the standard phase noise model is critical to accurately predict the performance of frequency combs. The description presented here paves the way for improved designs tailored to applications such as super-continuum generation and optical communication.         ",

Equipped with these features QICAS yields for smaller correlated molecules sets of optimized orbitals with respect to which the CASCI energy reaches the corresponding CASSCF energy within chemical accuracy. For more challenging systems such as the Chromium dimer, QICAS offers an excellent starting point for CASSCF by greatly reducing the number of iterations required for numerical convergence.
