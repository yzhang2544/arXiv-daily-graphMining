    "title": "Optical Multilayer Thin Film Structure Inverse Design: From Optimization to Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "           Optical multilayer thin film structures have been widely used in numerous photonic domains and applications. The key component to enable these applications is the inverse design. Different from other photonic structures such as metasurface or waveguide, multilayer thin film is a one-dimensional structure, which deserves its own treatment for the design process. Optimization has always been the standard design algorithm for decades. Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of integrating different deep learning algorithms to tackle the inverse design problems. A natural question to ask is: how do these algorithms differ from each other? Why do we need to develop so many algorithms and what type of challenges do they solve? What is the state-of-the-art algorithm in this domain? Here, we review recent progress and provide a guide-tour through this research area, starting from traditional optimization to recent deep learning approaches. Challenges and future perspectives are also discussed.         ",

    "abstract": "           The design and analysis of high energy density (HED) laser experiments typically rely on radiation hydrodynamics simulations. However, some laser-plasma interaction regimes are not collisional and cannot be adequately modeled with hydrodynamics. For example, strongly driven magnetic reconnection and magnetized collisionless shock experiments possess extended hydrodynamic or even kinetic properties, necessitating first-principles kinetic simulations. In this paper, we present the benchmarking and first results obtained with a laser-ray-tracing and inverse Bremsstrahlung absorption module implemented in the particle-in-cell code PSC. The simulation results are compared to radiation hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code as well as analytical estimates. We successfully benchmark the energy deposition model and overall hydrodynamic evolution of the systems. We also consider possible kinetic effects that may be expected from laser-target ablation in the HED regime, including non-local transport and two-temperature effects.         ",

This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.

    "title": "Reconfigurable Manipulation of Sound with a Multi-material 3D-Printed Origami Metasurface",
    "abstract": "           The challenge in reconfigurable manipulation of sound waves using metasurfaces lies in achieving precise control over acoustic behavior while developing efficient and practical tuning methods for structural configurations. However, most studies on reconfigurable acoustic metasurfaces rely on cumbersome and time-consuming control systems. These approaches often struggle with fabrication techniques, as conventional methods face limitations such as restricted material choices, challenges in achieving complex geometries, and difficulties in incorporating flexible components. This paper proposes a novel approach for developing a reconfigurable metasurface inspired by the Kresling origami pattern, designed for programmable manipulation of acoustic waves at an operating frequency of 2000 Hz. The origami unit cell is fabricated using multi-material 3D printing technology, allowing for the simultaneous printing of two materials with different mechanical properties, thus creating a bistable origami-based structure. Through optimization, two equilibrium states achieve a reflection phase difference of {\\pi} through the application of small axial force, F, or torque, T. Various configurations of the metasurface, generated from different combinations of these two equilibria, enable distinct reflective behaviors with switchable and programmable functionalities. The principle of this work simplifies the shaping of acoustic waves through a straightforward mechanical mechanism, eliminating the need for complex control systems and time-consuming adjustments. This innovative approach paves a novel and effective perspective for developing on-demand switchable and tunable devices across diverse fields, including electromagnetics, mechanics, and elastics, leveraging multi-material printing technology.

By utilizing linearly chirped sampled gratings and incorporating multiple true {\\pi}-phase shifts within the cavity, we achieved and experimentally validated a four-wavelength laser with a channel spacing of 0.4 nm. The device operates stably and uniformly across a wide range of injection currents from 280 mA to 350 mA. The average wavelength spacing was measured at 0.401 nm with a standard deviation of 0.0081 nm. Additionally, we demonstrated a 0.3 nm MW-DFB laser with a seven-channel output, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.274 nm and a standard deviation of 0.0055 nm. This MW-DFB laser features a ridge waveguide with sidewall gratings, requiring only one metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) step and a single III-V material etching process. This streamlined fabrication approach simplifies device manufacturing and is well-suited for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems.         ",

The stratified medium gives rise to a spherically aberrated intensity profile near the focal region of the optical tweezers, with off-axis intensity lobes in the radial direction possessing opposite LSAM (helicities corresponding to $\\sigma = +1$ and -1) compared to the beam centre. We trap mesoscopic birefringent particles in an off-axis intensity lobe as well as at the beam center by modifying the trapping plane, and observe particles spinning in opposite directions depending on their location. The direction of rotation depends on particle size with large particles spinning either clockwise (CW) or anticlockwise (ACW) depending on the direction of spirality of the polarization of the ARP vector beam after tight focusing, while smaller particles spin in both directions depending on their spatial location. Numerical simulations support our experimental observations. Our results introduce new avenues in spin-orbit optomechanics to facilitate novel yet straightforward avenues for exotic and complex particle manipulation in optical tweezers.         ",

Away from the mirror, the resonance frequencies of the Kittel mode (KM) inside a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble have sinusoidal shifts as the normalized distance between the spin ensemble and the mirror increases compared to the setup without the mirror. These shifts are a consequence of the KM's interaction with its own image. Furthermore, the variation of the magnon radiative decay into the waveguide shows a cosine squared oscillation and is enhanced twofold when the KM sits at the magnetic antinode of the corresponding eigenmode. We can finely tune the KM to achieve the maximum adsorption of the input photons at the critical coupling point. Moreover, by placing the KM in proximity to the node of the resonance field, its lifetime is extended to more than eight times compared to its positioning near the antinode.         ",

We present a comprehensive study of the SnS and SnSe crystals by means of optical spectroscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab initio calcualtions.

    "abstract": "           The upconversion process for the $Er^{3+}$ ion, when irradiated with IR photons at 980 nm, strongly depends upon the presence of the sensitizer $Yb^{3+}$ ions. There is a good correlation between the relative and absolute concentrations of the activator and sensitizer species and the intensities of the emission lines of the resulted visible spectrum. The ratios between emission intensities in the green band (510-580 nm) and red band (640-700 nm) (i.e., the spectral content) show similarities between different host crystals in which $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$ are embedded, which is an indication that, regardless of the crystalline medium of embedding, the dopant ions interact in some specific and similar ways. In order to reveal the mechanisms for the energy transfer between activator and sensitizer ions, one needs a model for the spatial distribution of these relative to one another, from which some statistical data, like crystal matrix average surrounding radii, could be inferred. Some models of cubic neighboring are presented for the relative concentration ratios of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, respectively of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8.         ",

    "abstract": "           Codesign, an integral part of computer architecture referring to the information interaction in hardware-software stack, is able to boost the algorithm mapping and execution in the computer hardware. This well applies to the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where quantum algorithms and quantum processors both need to be shaped to allow for advantages in experimental implementations. The state-of-the-art quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm faces challenges for scaling up, where the deteriorating optimization performance is not necessarily alleviated by increasing the circuit depth given the noise in the hardware. The counterdiabatic term can be introduced to accelerate the convergence, but decomposing the unitary operator corresponding to the counterdiabatic terms into one and two-qubit gates may add additional burden to the digital circuit depth. In this work, we focus on the counterdiabatic protocol with a codesigned approach to implement this algorithm on a photonic quantum processor. The tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh provides rich programmable parameters for local and global manipulation, making it able to perform arbitrary unitary evolutions. Accordingly, we directly implement the unitary operation associated to the counterdiabatic quantum optimization on our processor without prior digitization. Furthermore, we develop and implement an optimized counterdiabatic method by tackling the higher-order many-body interaction terms. Moreover, we benchmark the performance in the case of factorization, by comparing the final success probability and the convergence speed. In conclusion, we experimentally demonstrate the advantages of a codesigned mapping of counterdiabatic quantum dynamics for quantum computing on photonic platforms.         ",

However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%. While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions.

    "abstract": "           Cat states are maximally entangled states with applications in metrology and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The experiments have revealed that Rydberg collective avalanche decoherence acts as the bottleneck for cat creation with Rydberg atoms. This process initiates after the black body radiation (BBR-)induced decay of Rydberg atoms and sets a strong limit on the cat creation time. These findings necessitate the exploration of new ideas to accelerate current Rydberg cat schemes. To enhance the interaction-to-loss ratio, this paper delves into cat state formation in the strong Rydberg dressing regime, uncovering the emergence of cat states despite the presence of complex orders of nonlinearities. This unexplored regime demonstrates the potential for rapid cat state formation, particularly beneficial for operation in typical 2D lattices in Rydberg Labs. In an extreme case, this article demonstrates that second-order nonlinearity could be isolated under resonant Rydberg driving if a large number of atoms are accommodated inside the blockade volume. The resonant model significantly enhances the interaction-to-loss ratio while circumventing the adiabaticity condition, allowing fast switching of lasers. In addition, the paper presents a method for generating multi-component cat states, which are superpositions of $m$ coherent spin states ($|m-\\text{CSS}\\rangle$). The maximum value of $m$ is determined by the number of atoms within the blockade radius, where $m=\\sqrt{N}$. The states with larger $m$ are more robust against the presence of multiple orders of nonlinearity in the strong dressing Hamiltonian and are accessible in a much shorter time compared to traditional 2-component cat states.
