    "title": "Zero- to Ultralow-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",
    "abstract": "           Zero and ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) is an NMR modality where experiments are performed in fields at which spin-spin interactions within molecules and materials are stronger than Zeeman interactions. This typically occurs at external fields of microtesla strength or below, considerably smaller than Earth's field. In ZULF NMR, the measurement of spin-spin couplings and spin relaxation rates provides a nondestructive means for identifying chemicals and chemical fragments, and for conducting sample or process analyses. The absence of the symmetry imposed by a strong external magnetic field enables experiments that exploit terms in the nuclear spin Hamiltonian that are suppressed in high-field NMR, which in turn opens up new capabilities in a broad range of fields, from the search for dark matter to the preparation of hyperpolarized contrast agents for clinical imaging. Furthermore, as in ZULF NMR the Larmor frequencies are typically in the audio band, the nuclear spins can be addressed with d.c. magnetic field pulses, and highly sensitive magnetometers are used for detection. In contrast to high-field NMR, the low-frequency signals readily pass through conductive materials such as metals, and heterogeneous samples do not produce resonance line broadening, meaning that high-resolution spectroscopy is possible. Notable practical advantages of ZULF NMR spectroscopy are the low cost and relative simplicity and portability of the spectrometer system. In recent years ZULF NMR has become more accessible, thanks to improvements in magnetometer sensitivity and their commercial availability, and the development of hyperpolarization methods that provide a simple means to boost signal strengths by several orders of magnitude. These topics are reviewed and a perspective on potential future avenues of ZULF-NMR research is presented.         ",

The scheme involves the interaction of an extremely intense ($I \\gtrsim \\SI{e24}{\\watt/\\cm^2}$) circularly polarized laser pulse with a solid-density target containing a conical cavity. Through full-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that account for quantum electrodynamical effects, it is shown that this interaction results in two significant outcomes: first, the generation of quasi-static axial magnetic fields reaching tens of gigagauss due to the inverse Faraday effect; and second, the production of large quantities of electron-positron pairs (up to $\\num{e13}$) via the Breit-Wheeler process. The $e^-e^+$ plasma becomes trapped in the magnetic field and remains confined for hundreds of femtoseconds, far exceeding the laser timescale. The dependency of pair plasma parameters, as well as the efficiency of plasma production and confinement, is discussed in relation to the properties of the laser pulse and the target. Realizing this scheme experimentally would enable the investigation of physical processes relevant to extreme astrophysical environments.         ",

This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.         ",

Here, we showcase a vector OPM that utilizes Rabi oscillations driven between the hyperfine manifolds of $^{87}$Rb to measure the direction of a DC magnetic field against the polarization ellipse structure of a microwave field. By relying solely on atomic measurements -- free-induction decay (FID) signals and Rabi measurements across multiple atomic transitions -- this sensor can detect drift in the microwave vector reference and compensate for systematic shifts caused by off-resonant driving, nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effects, and buffer gas collisions. To facilitate dead-zone-free operation, we also introduce a novel Rabi measurement that utilizes dressed-state resonances that appear during simultaneous Larmor precession and Rabi driving (SPaR). These measurements, performed within a microfabricated vapor cell platform, achieve an average vector accuracy of 0.46 mrad and vector sensitivities down to 11 $\\mu$rad$/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for geomagnetic field strengths near 50 $\\mu$T.

In-depth analysis has been devoted to the seemingly simplest array system: a one-dimensionally periodic lattice of two-dimensional scatterers embedded in a dispersionless medium governed by the Helmholtz equation. We investigate such a system and experimentally confirm the existence of a new class of generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves that have been recently theorised to exist in classical wave regimes, without the need for resonant scatterers. Airborne acoustics serves as such a regime and here we experimentally observe the first generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves above the first cut-off, i.e., in the radiative regime. We consider radiative acoustic lattice resonances along a diffraction grating and connect them to generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves by considering both short and long arrays of non-resonant 2D cylindrical Neumann scatterers embedded in air. On short arrays, we observe finite lattice resonances under continuous wave excitation, and on long arrays, we observe propagating Rayleigh--Bloch waves under pulsed excitation. We interpret their existence by considering multiple wave scattering theory and, in doing so, unify differing nomenclatures used to describe waves on infinite periodic and finite arrays and the interpretation of their dispersive properties.

    "abstract": "           A new determination of the molar gas constant was performed from measurements of the speed of sound in argon at the triple point of water and extrapolation to zero pressure. A new resonant cavity was used. This is a triaxial ellipsoid whose walls are gold-coated steel and which is divided into two identical halves that are bolted and sealed with an O-ring. Microwave and electroacoustic traducers are located in the northern and southern parts of the cavity, respectively, so that measurements of microwave and acoustic frequencies are carried out in the same experiment. Measurements were taken at pressures from 600 kPa to 60 kPa and at 273.16 K. The internal equivalent radius of the cavity was accurately determined by microwave measurements and the first four radial symmetric acoustic modes were simultaneously measured and used to calculate the speed of sound. The improvements made using the new cavity have reduced by half the main contributions to the uncertainty due to the radius determination using microwave measurements which amounts to 4.7 parts in $10^{6}$ and the acoustic measurements, 4.4 parts in $10^{6}$, where the main contribution (3.7 parts in $10^{6}$) is the relative excess half-widths associated with the limit of our acoustic model, compared with our previous measurements. As a result of all the improvements with the new cavity and the measurements performed, we determined the molar gas constant $R$ = (8.314 449 $\\pm$ 0.000 056) J/(K mol) which corresponds to a relative standard uncertainty of 6.7 parts in $10^{6}$.

The traffic-induced seismic wave is a prominent contributor to urban vibrations and contain crucial information to advance urban exploration and governance. However, identifying vehicular movements within massive noisy data poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a real-time semi-supervised vehicle monitoring framework tailored to urban settings. It requires only a small fraction of manual labels for initial training and exploits unlabeled data for model improvement. Additionally, the framework can autonomously adapt to newly collected unlabeled data. Before DAS data undergo object detection as two-dimensional images to preserve spatial information, we leveraged comprehensive one-dimensional signal preprocessing to mitigate noise. Furthermore, we propose a novel prior loss that incorporates the shapes of vehicular traces to track a single vehicle with varying speeds. To evaluate our model, we conducted experiments with seismic data from the Stanford 2 DAS Array. The results showed that our model outperformed the baseline model Efficient Teacher and its supervised counterpart, YOLO (You Only Look Once), in both accuracy and robustness. With only 35 labeled images, our model surpassed YOLO's mAP 0.5:0.95 criterion by 18% and showed a 7% increase over Efficient Teacher.

It is of particular importance with cryogenic propellants where periodic tank venting maneuvers and leak detection place a special emphasis on accurate mass gauging. Several competing technologies have arisen, but capacitance mass gauging has several distinct advantages due to its low mass, non-intrusiveness, and whole volume interrogation technique. Capacitance based measurement has also seen recent success in measuring cryogenic liquid nitrogen and hydrogen volume fraction and flow rate, showing its compatibility with cryogenic propellants. However, the effects of gravity on fluid behavior make the calibration and testing of these sensors difficult on the ground. In this paper a prototype sensor is constructed that can emulate fluid positions in microgravity and earth gravity configurations. Experimental propellant fills and drains are conducted using a simulant fluid with similar electrical properties to cryogenic propellants. This expanded dataset is compared with previous simulation results and used to construct a machine learning model capable of calculating the fluid mass in tanks both with and without propellant management devices.

    "abstract": "           Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation, highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics-based models, machine learning (ML)-based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides high-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the importance of combining data from different domains, including physics-based model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.         ",

The effect of Sb-content on the frequency positions of these phonon modes has been very well correlated with the simulated strain. The Raman peaks show different frequency shifts in the heterostructure with varying Sb-content in the capping layer. This shift is attributed to the strain relaxation, bigger size of quantum dots and type-II band alignment.         ",

However, the computational resources required for such efforts are extensive. Here, we explore the possibility of employing the recent computing paradigm of quantum computing to simulate fluid flows. The lure of this new paradigm is the potentially exponential advantage in memory and speed, in comparison with classical computing. This field has recently witnessed a considerable uptick in excitement and contributions. In this work, we give a succinct discussion of the progress made so far, with focus on fluid flows, accompanied by an enumeration of challenges that require sustained efforts for progress. Quantum computing of fluid flows has a promising future, but the inherently nonlinear nature of flows requires serious efforts on resolving various bottlenecks, and on synthesising progress on theoretical, numerical and experimental fronts. We present certain critical details that have not yet attracted adequate attention.         ",

To investigate electronic interactions at such interfaces, we measure optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from iron-octaethylporphyrin (FeOEP) adsorbed on Cu(001), and perform electronic structure calculations using coupled cluster methods including optical excitations. We find that the SHG response of FeOEP/Cu(001) is modified at 2.15-2.35 eV fundamental photon energy compared to the bare Cu(001) surface. Our polarization-dependent analysis shows that the $\\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ non-linear susceptibility tensor element dominates this modification. The first-principles calculations confirm this effect and conclude a resonantly enhanced SHG by molecular transitions at $\\hbar\\omega \\geq 2$ eV. We show that the enhancement of $\\chi^{(2)}_{zzz}$ results from a strong charge-transfer character of the molecule-substrate interaction. Our findings demonstrate the suitability of surface SHG for the characterization of such interfaces and the potential to employ it for time-resolved SHG experiments on optically induced electronic dynamics.

Unfortunately, these studies have only involved and prevailingly focused on the behavior of a single particle. Here, we propose and experimentally realize quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in engineered non-Hermitian photonic lattices. We have successfully observed the unidirectional behavior of quantum walks in the bulk far from the edges induced by the skin effect.

In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-Jahn--Teller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence PL lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spinpolarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of ODMR contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spinpolarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.

Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.

The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch.

    "abstract": "           The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier, interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.

    "abstract": "           Quantum computers can revolutionize science and technology, but their realization remains challenging across all platforms. A promising route to scalability is photonic measurement-based quantum computation, where single-qubit measurements on large cluster states, together with feedforward, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, generating large cluster states at high rates is notoriously difficult, as detection probabilities drop exponentially with the number of photons comprising the state. We tackle this challenge by encoding multiple qubits on each photon through high-dimensional spatial encoding, generating cluster states with over nine qubits at a rate of 100Hz. Additionally, we demonstrate that high-dimensional encoding substantially reduces the computation duration by enabling instantaneous feedforward between qubits encoded in the same photon. Our findings pave the way for resource-efficient measurement-based quantum computation using high-dimensional entanglement.         ",

    "title": "Toward Microgravity Mass Gauging with Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing: Sensor Design and Experiment",
    "abstract": "           The use of capacitance sensors for fuel mass gauging has been in consideration since the early days of manned space flight. However, certain difficulties arise when considering tanks in microgravity environments. Surface tension effects lead to fluid wetting of the interior surface of the tank, leaving large interior voids, while thrust/settling effects can lead to dispersed two-phase mixtures. With the exception of capacitance-based sensing, few sensing technologies are well suited for measuring annular, stratified, and dispersed fluid configurations. Two modalities of capacitance measurement are compared: Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) and Electrical Capacitance Volume Sensing (ECVS). ECVT is a non-invasive imaging modality first introduced in 2006. ECVS is a measurement modality introduced in this paper that is derived from ECVT technology but does not reconstruct an image as part of the mass measurement. To optimize the design of future capacitance-based spherical tank mass gauging sensors, different electrode plate layouts are evaluated in a mass gauging context. Prototype sensors are constructed, and experiments are conducted with fluid fills in various orientations. The plate layouts and their effect on the performance of the sensor as a fuel mass gauge are analyzed through the use of imaging and averaging techniques.         ",

    "abstract": "           Broadband correlated photon pairs (biphotons) are valuable in quantum metrology, but current generation methods either involve complex nonlinear structures or lack sufficient bandwidth and brightness. In this work, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique for generation of a bright collinear biphoton field with a broad spectrum, achieved by using a tightly focused pump in a bulk nonlinear crystal. As the most straightforward application of the source, we employ Michelson interferometer-based quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT). Utilizing the source enables the demonstration of record resolution and dispersion cancellation for this QOCT scheme.         ",

    "title": "Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state",
    "abstract": "           A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.         ",
