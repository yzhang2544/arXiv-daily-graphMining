    "abstract": "           This study reports the successful fabrication of high-positive refractive index change waveguides, exceeding 0.02 in fluoride glasses, marking a significant advancement in integrated optical components for visible to mid-infrared applications. This research overcomes longstanding challenges in direct-write photonics and therefore enables the realization of true 3D geometries in optical elements, access to novel visible lasing wavelengths typically suppressed in high phonon hosts, and the miniaturization of mid-infrared optical devices. The investigation into the waveguides' origin attributes the exceptionally high index change to material densification driven by the migration of specific elements, mainly barium, within the glass composition. These waveguides, characterized by low insertion losses, and highly customizable V-numbers evidenced by multimode operation at 3.5 um, offers substantial potential for chip laser technology and the creation of advanced optical devices for sensing and spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "           Research on microwave signal measurement techniques is risen, driven by the expanding urgent demands of wireless communication, global positioning systems, remote sensing and 6G networks. In stark contrast with traditional electronic-based realization, the implementations of microwave signal measurement systems based on integrated compact photonic chip have exhibited distinct advantages in high operation bandwidth, light weight, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, although numerous integrated microwave photonic signal measurement systems have been reported, measurement bandwidth of the majority of them is still below 30 GHz due to the bandwidth limitation of electro-optical modulators (EOMs). Furthermore, previous studies often are more focused on the measurement of one single parameter (typically the frequency) of microwave signals, which has hindered their practical application in complex situations. Here, an integrated photonic microwave multi-parameter measurement system composed of microwave frequency measurement module and microwave phase amplitude measurement module based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform is reported. Utilizing this system, not only the ultra-high bandwidth (up to 60GHz) of microwave frequency, phase and amplitude measurement with low root-mean-squares errors (450MHz, 3.43\u00b0 and 1.64% of the measurement for frequency, phase and amplitude, respectively), but also the time-domain reconstruction of sinusoidal microwave signals is achieved. This demonstration further broadens the application of integrated TFLN photonic devices in microwave signal measurement technology to address the bandwidth bottleneck of the ever-growing microwave networks in the future information society.

However, the characterization of the full three-dimensional vectorial structures of the topological texures at the nanoscale has remained a challenge. Here, we propose a novel probe based on the fiber taper-silver nanowire waveguide structure to achieve super-resolution mapping of the topological textures. Based on the mode selection rules, the three-dimensional decomposed electric fields in both the far-field and near-field are directly collected and reconstructed without postprocessing algorithms, clearly visualizing the topological texures formed in free space and evanescent waves respectively. The fiber-integrated probe is further demonstrated to be robust and broadband. This approach holds promise for the characterization of more sophisticated topology in optical field, which may allow for advance applications in optical information processing and data storage.

    "abstract": "           Understanding the mechanical interplay between silicon anodes and their surrounding solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essential to improve the next generation of lithium-ion batteries. We model and simulate a 2D elliptical silicon nanowire with SEI via a thermodynamically consistent chemo-mechanical continuum ansatz using a higher order finite element method in combination with a variable-step, variable-order time integration scheme. Considering a soft viscoplastic SEI for three half cycles, we see at the minor half-axis the largest stress magnitude at the silicon nanowire surface, leading to a concentration anomaly. This anomaly is caused by the shape of the nanowire itself and not by the SEI. Also for the tangential stress of the SEI, the largest stress magnitudes are at this point, which can lead to SEI fracture. However, for a stiff SEI, the largest stress magnitude inside the nanowire occurs at the major half-axis, causing a reduced concentration distribution in this area. The largest tangential stress of the SEI is still at the minor half-axis. In total, we demonstrate the importance of considering the mechanics of the anode and SEI in silicon anode simulations and encourage further numerical and model improvements.         ",

Electric permittivity or dielectric constant is a physical property that depends on temperature and pressure $\\epsilon$($p$,$T$). Based on this property, a measuring technique consisting of a cylindrical resonant cavity that works in the microwave spectrum has been developed. Equilibrium data of fluid mixtures are measured at high pressure using a synthetic method, where phase transition is determined under isothermal conditions due to the change of the dielectric constant. This technique may be a more accurate alternative to conventional visual synthetic methods. The technique was validated measuring pure $CO_{2}$, and phase behaviour was then determined for two binary mixtures [$CO_{2}$ (0.6) + $CH_{4}$ (0.4)] and [$CO_{2}$ (0.4) + $CH_{4}$ (0.6)], results for which are presented. These systems are interesting for the study of biogas-like mixtures. In addition, data were compared with the equation of state used for natural gas GERG-2008, and also, they were modelled using Peng-Robinson equation of state and Wong-Sandler mixing rules, which are widely employed in chemical industries and which give good results.

We confirm the presence of momentum-space glide reflection from the measured momentum half translation of edge bands and their momentum-resolved probability distribution using a cylinder geometry made of acoustic resonator arrays. In particular, we observe both intrinsic and extrinsic HOTI features in such a cylinder: hopping strength variation along the open boundary leads to a bulk gap closure, while that along the closed boundary results in an edge gap closure.

The axial electron number density was measured to be invariant (about 2x10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$) along the entire filament length and for all tested laser pulse energies 5-15 mJ, and the corresponding laser intensity in the middle portion of the filament was estimated to be nearly constant for 5-15 mJ pulse energies (about 30-40 TW/cm$^2$). These fundings support that intensity clamping conditions were achieved in the experiments. The proposed approach enables capabilities that are currently unavailable to perform absolute and longitudinally resolved measurements of electron number density in laser filaments and to precisely characterize conditions associated with self-focusing and intensity clamping.

    "abstract": "           An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.         ",

    "abstract": "           Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40\u00b0 to 43\u00b0 over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20\u00b0. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25\u00b0. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, while the HPBW remains below 20\u00b0 across the operational frequency range.

By performing a comprehensive polarization tomography, we demonstrate that the polarization of the emitted photons directly reflects the qBIC mode's far-field properties. Furthermore, we show that both the type of qBIC mode and the symmetry of the meta-atoms can be tailored to control each single-photon polarization state, and that the subsequent two-photon polarization states are nearly separable, offering potential applications in the heralded generation of single photons with adjustable polarization.
