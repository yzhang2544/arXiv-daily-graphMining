    "abstract": "This paper presents several component prototypes towards a low-latency, small-form-factor optical link designed for the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter Phase-I trigger upgrade. A prototype of the custom-made dual-channel optical transmitter module, the Miniature optical Transmitter (MTx), with separate transmitter optical sub-assemblies (TOSAs) has been demonstrated at data rates up to 8 Gbps per channel. A Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) driver ASIC has been developed and is used in the current MTx prototypes. A serializer ASIC prototype, operating at up to 8 Gbps per channel, has been designed and tested. A low-latency, low-overhead encoder ASIC prototype has been designed and tested. The latency of the whole link, including the transmitter latency and the receiver latency but not the latency of the fiber, is estimated to be less than 57.9 ns. The size of the MTx is 45 mm x 15 mm x 6 mm. ",

    "abstract": "Demand for artificial body implants has been on the rise over the years. However, wear and bacterial infection are identified as two major reasons that can lead to inflammation and implant failure. In this communication, the advantages of pulsed laser deposited zirconia thin film on Ti6Al4V bio-alloy at room temperature and at an elevated substrate temperature are discussed wherein a comparison of the change in surface roughness, wettability, surface free energy, tribological and antibacterial properties of uncoated and zirconia coated Ti6Al4V samples is presented. The results of tribological analysis carried out using a standard ball-on-disc tribometer at different loads (2N, 5N and 7N) exhibited advantageous effects of zirconia coating on Ti6Al4V. Prominently, the sample coated at 200 C substrate temperature maintained very low coefficient of friction up to hundreds of sliding cycles and showed a notable reduction in the wear rate by 49% at 5N load. The in vitro bacterial retention test showed a clear inhibition in growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia bacteria on the surface of the coated samples indicating the possibility of prevention of biofilm formation. More than 50% reduction in density of Staphylococcus aureus was observed on coated sample in comparison to pristine Ti6Al4V and this can be attributed to reduction in surface energy of the sample after coating. Additionally, the observation of a larger number of decimated bacteria on coated samples by fluorescence microscopy revealed superior antibacterial properties of zirconia coating. The novelty of this work is the use of pulsed laser deposition technique for zirconia coating which dearly improves tribological and antibacterial properties of Ti6Al4V simultaneously; this shows prospects of increasing durability of artificial implant in the human body.

Aside from the intensity of the light, represented by the number of photons, their phase provides important information and enables a plethora of applications.

Using the optical interference of frequency-converted photons and leftover pump photons of the involved ultrashort pulses, fast determination of layer-thicknesses is demonstrated. The new method enables phase-resolved detection of terahertz pulses using standard sCMOS equipment while achieving sample measurement times of less than one second with a precision error of less than 0.6%.

Among the existing photonic platforms, high-index contrast silicon nitride ($Si_{3}N_{4}$) waveguides offer broadband transparency in the visible spectral range and a high scale of integration. As far as the complexity of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increases, on-chip detectors are required to monitor their working point for reconfiguration and stabilization operations. In this work we present a compact in-line power monitor integrated in $Si_{3}N_{4}$ waveguides that operates in the red-light wavelength range (660 nm). The proposed device exploits the photoconductivity of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) film employed as a coating layer of the optical waveguide. Experimental results show a responsivity of 30 mA/W, a sensitivity of -45 dBm and a sub-${\\mu}$s time response. These features enable the use of the proposed photoconductor for high-sensitivity monitoring and control of visible-light $Si_{3}N_{4}$ PICs. ",

After a thorough characterization of structural, morphological, and compositional characteristics of the prepared samples, we focus on a detailed study of the optical and mechanical losses in those materials. Mechanical losses are further investigated from a microscopic point of view by comparing our experimental results with molecular dynamic simulations of the amorphous SiC structure: first we define a protocol to generate a numerical model of the amorphous film, capturing the main features of the real system; then we simulate its dynamical behaviour upon deformation in order to obtain its mechanical response.

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are special purpose machines that are expected to be particularly useful in simulating strongly correlated chemical systems. The quantum computer excels at treating a moderate number of orbitals within an active space in a fully quantum mechanical manner. We present a quantum phase estimation calculation on F$_2$ in a (2,2) active space on Rigetti's Aspen-11 QPU. While this is a promising start, it also underlines the need for carefully selecting the orbital spaces treated by the quantum computer. In this work, a scheme for selecting such an active space automatically is described and simulated results obtained using both the quantum phase estimation (QPE) and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms are presented and combined with a subtractive method to enable accurate description of the environment. The active occupied space is selected from orbitals localized on the chemically relevant fragment of the molecule, while the corresponding virtual space is chosen based on the magnitude of interactions with the occupied space calculated from perturbation theory. This protocol is then applied to two chemical systems of pharmaceutical relevance: the enzyme [Fe] hydrogenase and the photosenzitizer temoporfin. While the sizes of the active spaces currently amenable to a quantum computational treatment are not enough to demonstrate quantum advantage, the procedure outlined here is applicable to any active space size, including those that are outside the reach of classical computation.

While substantial progress has been made separately towards ultra-low loss, $\\leq1$ dB/m, chip-scale photonic circuits and high brightness single-photon sources, integration of these technologies has remained elusive. Here, we report a significant advance towards this goal, in the hybrid integration of a quantum emitter single-photon source with a wafer-scale, ultra-low loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuit. We demonstrate triggered and pure single-photon emission directly into a Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic circuit with $\\approx1$ dB/m propagation loss at a wavelength of $\\approx920$ nm. These losses are more than two orders of magnitude lower than reported to date for any photonic circuit with on-chip quantum emitter sources, and $>50$ % lower than for any prior foundry-compatible integrated quantum photonic circuit, to the best of our knowledge. Using these circuits we report the observation of resonance fluorescence in the strong drive regime, a milestone towards integrated coherent control of quantum emitters. These results constitute an important step forward towards the creation of scaled chip-integrated photonic quantum information systems. ",

The mappings use complex rational function representations of individual qubits, producing classical vector field configurations that can be interpreted in terms of 2D inviscid fluid flows or electric fields. Elementary qubits are identified with localized defects in 2D harmonic vector fields, and multi-qubit states find natural field representations via complex superpositions of vector field products. In particular, separable states appear as highly symmetric flow configurations, making them both dynamically and visually distinct from entangled states. The resulting real-space representations of entangled qubit states enable an intuitive visualization of their transformations under quantum logic operations. We demonstrate this for the quantum Fourier transform and the period finding process underlying Shor's algorithm, along with other quantum algorithms. Due to its generic construction, the mapping procedure suggests the possibility of extending concepts such as entanglement or entanglement entropy to classical continuum systems, and thus may help guide new experimental approaches to information storage and non-standard computation.

We propose alternative measurement schemes that circumvent this limit, and also demonstrate superiority to direct measurement for a related binary hypothesis test. Our findings add to a growing list of examples in which a quantum analysis uncovers significant information gains for certain tasks in opto-molecular metrology that do not rely on multiphoton interference, but evidently do benefit from a more thorough exploitation of the coherence properties of single photons.

Although these aspects are typically discussed separately, they are deeply interconnected: indeed, a new electrolyte can allow the use of different cathodes with higher energy, lower cost or more pronounced environmental compatibility. We focus on alternative class of electrolyte solutions for lithium batteries formed by dissolving LiX salts in glyme solvents, i.e., organic ethers with the molecular formula CH3O[CH2CH2O]nCH3 differing by chain length. The advantages of these electrolytes are illustrated in terms of flammability, stability, toxicity, environmental compatibility, cell performances and economic impact. A particular light is shed on the stability of these systems, particularly in the polymer state, and in various environments including oxygen, sulfur and high-energy lithium metal. The most relevant studies on the chemical-physical features, the characteristic structures, the favorable properties, and the electrochemical behavior of the glyme-based solutions are discussed, and the most recent technological achievements in terms of cell design and battery performance are described. The use of glyme-based electrolytes in high-energy cells arranged by coupling the lithium-metal anode with conventional insertion cathodes as well as in alternative and new batteries exploiting the Li-S and Li-O2 conversion processes are described in detail. The paragraphs reveal bonuses, including safety, low cost and sustainability, that can be achieved by employing the glyme-based electrolytes with respect to the commercially available ones, in particular taking into account future and alternative applications. Particular relevance is given by the glymes with long chain that reveal a remarkable stability, high safety and very low toxicity. ",
