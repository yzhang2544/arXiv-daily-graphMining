    "title": "SIRS sequence as frequency filter: A simulation and phantom study of  spin-lock preparations among composite signals",
    "abstract": "Extracting quantitative information of neuronal signals by non-invasive imaging is an outstanding challenge for understanding brain function and pathology. However, state-of-the-art techniques offer low sensitivity to deep electrical sources. Stimulus induced rotary saturation (SIRS) is a recently proposed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence that detects oscillatory magnetic fields using a spin-lock preparation. Phantom experiments and simulations proved its efficiency and sensitivity, but the susceptibility of the method to field inhomogeneities is still not well understood. In this study, we present a simulation model for the double resonance effect that enables the simulation of any oscillating neuronal field. We analyzed the performance of three spin-lock preparations and their response to field inhomogeneities in the presence of a resonant oscillating field. We show that the composite spin-lock preparation is more robust against field variations within the double resonance effect at the expense of losing contrast amplitude. We studied the SIRS contrast as a filter of spectral frequencies and its capability to recover information about the spectral components of a composite signal. This study sets the bases to move one step further towards the clinical application of MR-based neuronal current imaging. ",

The coarse wavelength adjustment via the rotation of a diffraction grating is decoupled from the fine tuning of the external cavity modes by positioning a piezo transducer behind the diode laser, making the laser robust against misalignment and hysteresis even with long external cavities. Two laser prototypes with external cavities of different lengths were tested with a 780 nm laser diode, and locked to an atomic reference. We observe a mode-hop-free frequency tunability broader than the free spectral range of the external cavity upon changes of its length. The design is well suited to atomic and molecular experiments demanding a high level of stability over time. ",

Correlating SiV$^-$ emission with the defect's atomic-scale structure is important for controlling and optimizing quantum emission, but remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we use cathodoluminescence imaging in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to elucidate the structural sources of non-ideality in the SiV$^-$ emission from nanodiamonds with sub-nanometer-scale resolution. We show that different crystalline domains of a nanodiamond exhibit distinct zero-phonon line (ZPL) energies and differences in brightness, while near-surface SiV$^-$ emitters remain bright. We correlate these changes with local lattice expansion using 4D STEM and diffraction, and show that associated blue shifts from the ZPL are due to defect density heterogeneity, while red shifts are due to lattice distortions.

A partial transmission through the partition leads to interaction between the two cavities' modes and to multiple avoided crossings between modes' frequencies as a function of the partition position. This is analogous to a quantum system that has two multi-level and interacting sub-systems and thus exhibits multiple avoided crossings. Such an acoustic analog is realized and studied by measuring the sound transmission as a function of frequency through a pipe with a partially transmitting and movable partition. An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental results and a simple model based on sound wave transmission and reflection at different interfaces. ",

The laser frequency is automatically stabilized to an optical reference cavity with a home-made controller, which is based on a combination of digital circuit and analog circuit. The digital circuit is used for diagnosing and manipulating the state of the ultra-stable laser, and the analog circuit is used for demodulating the discriminate signal and servo control. A method of searching the transmission signal in the closed-loop state instead of the open-loop state is proposed to reduce the locking time and improve the reliable of the auto-locking ultra-stable laser. The median time of 16.6s is obtained after 157 times of relocking, and the probability of less than 20 s is more than 86%. The median linewidth of 1.08 Hz is obtained, and the fractional frequency instability is less than 3.4E-15 at integration time between 0.1 and 100 s. The performance of this system demonstrates that will be used as an important subsystem to transfer the optical clock signal. ",

    "abstract": "The adoption of 3D packaging technology necessitates the development of new approaches to failure electronic device analysis. To that end, our team is developing a tool called the quantum diamond microscope (QDM) that leverages an ensemble of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, achieving vector magnetic imaging with a wide field-of-view and high spatial resolution under ambient conditions. Here, we present the QDM measurement of 2D current distributions in an 8-nm flip chip IC and 3D current distributions in a multi-layer PCB. Magnetic field emanations from the C4 bumps in the flip chip dominate the QDM measurements, but these prove to be useful for image registration and can be subtracted to resolve adjacent current traces in the die at the micron scale. Vias in 3D ICs display only Bx and By magnetic fields due to their vertical orientation and are difficult to detect with magnetometers that only measure the Bz component (orthogonal to the IC surface). Using the multi-layer PCB, we show that the QDM's ability to simultaneously measure Bx, By, and Bz is advantageous for resolving magnetic fields from vias as current passes between layers. We also show how spacing between conducting layers is determined by magnetic field images and how it agrees with the design specifications of the PCB. In our initial efforts to provide further z-depth information for current sources in complex 3D circuits, we show how magnetic field images of individual layers can be subtracted from the magnetic field image of the total structure. This allows for isolation of signal layers and can be used to map embedded current paths via solution of the 2D magnetic inverse. In addition, the paper also discusses the use of neural networks to identify 2D current distributions and its potential for analyzing 3D structures. ",

    "abstract": "This article describes experimental research studies conducted towards understanding the implementation aspects of high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels in mission-critical metro-scale operational environments based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology. The test bed for this research study was carefully designed to mimic such environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an 800 Gbps quantum-secured optical channel--along with several other Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) channels on the C-band and multiplexed with the QKD channel on the O-band--was established at distances up to 100 km, with secure-key rates relevant for practical industry use cases. In addition, during the course of these trials, transporting a blockchain application over this established channel was utilized as a demonstration of securing a financial transaction in transit over a quantum-secured optical channel. In a real-world operational environment, deployment of such high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels multiplexed with the quantum channel will inevitably introduce challenges due to their strict requirements, such as high launch powers and polarization fluctuations. Therefore, in the course of this research, experimental studies were conducted on the impact on the system performance--and specifically on the quantum channel--of several degradation factors present in real-world operational environments, including inter-channel interference (due to Raman scattering and nonlinear effects), attenuation, polarization fluctuations and distance dependency. The findings of this research pave the way towards the deployment of QKD-secured optical channels in high-capacity, metro-scale, mission-critical operational environments, such as Inter-Data Center Interconnects.

Since optical photons must be used for communication outside a dilution refrigerator, the direct conversion of microwave photons to optical photons has been widely investigated. However, the direct conversion approach suffers from added photon noise, heating due to a strong optical pump, and the requirement for large cooperativity. Instead, for quantum communication between superconducting qubits, we propose an entanglement distribution scheme using a solid-state spin quantum memory that works as an interface for both microwave and optical photons. The quantum memory enables quantum communication without significant heating inside the refrigerator, in contrast to schemes using high-power optical pumps. Moreover, introducing the quantum memory naturally makes it possible to herald entanglement and parallelization using multiple memories. ",
