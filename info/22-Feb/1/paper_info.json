It provides high precision temporal and spatial tuning of the driving laser via the dispersion manipulation, leading to a synchronous acceleration of the velocity increasing electrons over a large energy range. Additionally, the STC scheme is a general method and can be extended to driving fields of other wavelengths such as terahertz pulses.

Designing optical resonators with high ease-of-control and reconfigurability remains a open challenge thus far. Here we propose a novel mechanism to continuously reconfigure an optical resonator between one-port and two-port configurations via \\emph{phase-change material} for efficient optical modulation. By incorporating a phase-change material VO$_2$ substrate into a photonic crystal optical resonator, we computationally show that the system behaves as a one-port device with near-perfect absorption and two-port device with high transmission up to 92% when VO$_2$ is in the metallic rutile phase and insulating monoclinic phase, respectively. The optical response can be continuously and reversibly modulated between various intermediate states. More importantly, the proposed device is compatible with wide-angle operation and is robust against structural distortion. Our findings reveal a novel device architecture of \\emph{port reconfigurable} optical resonator uniquely enabled by switchable optical properties of phase change material. ",

Here, we present a new and counterintuitive method to promote THz performance in two-color scheme. Beyond our knowledge that the maximum THz generation occurs with two-color foci overlapped, we found that, when the foci of two-color beams are noticeably separated along the propagation axis resulting in cascading plasmas, the THz conversion efficiency is surged by one order of magnitude and the bandwidth is stretched by more than 2 times, achieving $10^{-3}$ conversion efficiency and $>$100 THz bandwidth under the condition of 800/400 nm, $\\sim$35 fs driving lasers. With the help of the pulse propagation equation and photocurrent model, the observations can be partially understood by the compromise between THz generation and absorption due to the spatial redistribution of laser energy in cascading plasmas.

The extent of changes in optical pumping, velocity changing collision and hyperfine changing collision rates associated with these conditions are discussed. There is a phenomenal change in the optical density by a factor of >25 times in presence of a control field in buffer gas environment. In contrary to earlier reports, we found confinement induced enhanced optical pumping as the mechanism behind the observed transparency in buffer gas cell. The feeble interplay of radiation trapping under specific conditions are pointed out. The diffusive velocity of atoms is measured to be ~25+-12 m/s and <= 8+-4 m/s for anti-relaxation coated and buffer gas filled cell respectively.

This is directly relevant to the quantum measurement problem and its possible resolution, and appears never to have been done before.

Aspects of the results may suggest a modification to Born's rule at very small wavefunction, with possibly profound implications for the detection of extremely rare events such as proton decay, but other explanations are not ruled out. Speculatively, I introduce two candidate small-wavefunction Born rule modifications, a hard cutoff, and an offset model with a stronger underlying physical rationale. Track distributions from decays in cloud chambers represent a previously unappreciated way to probe the foundations of quantum mechanics, and a novel case of wavefunctions with macroscopic signatures.

In particular, for long-distance communication, a significant fraction of the energy budget is spent on powering optical amplifiers that counteract the signal's attenuation, as measured by their gain. Here we show that an optimal quantum joint-detection receiver (OJDR) can significantly reduce the energy consumption of amplified optical communication links at any distance. Surprisingly, we find that the communication rate attainable with the OJDR is maximized by decreasing the amplifier gains as a function of their distance from the sender, in contrast with the optimal classical receiver, which requires full amplification. We then minimize the amplification energy cost with respect to the gain profile and observe significant energy savings in practically relevant communication settings, e.g., $\\approx$55\\% savings for a 2-fold enhancement of the communication rate. Our results mark a drastic change of perspective on classical data transmission via quantum channels, shifting the attention from large gains at small practical usefulness, such as short-distance- or deep-space- communication, to significant gains in a practically relevant regime.

    "abstract": "We study the effect of spontaneous emission and incoherent atomic pumping on the nonlinear semiclassical dynamics of the unbalanced Dicke model -- a generalization of the Dicke model that features independent coupling strengths for the co- and counter-rotating interaction terms. As well as the ubiquitous superradiant behavior the Dicke model is well-known for, the addition of spontaneous emission combined with the presence of strong counter-rotating terms creates laser-like behavior termed counter-lasing. These states appear in the semiclassical model as stable periodic orbits. We perform a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the appearance of counter-lasing in the unbalanced Dicke model subject to strong cavity dissipation, such that the cavity field can be adiabatically eliminated to yield an effective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. If the coupling strength of the co-rotating interactions is small, then the counter-lasing phase appears via a Hopf bifurcation of the de-excited state. We find that if the rate of spontaneous emission is small, this can lead to resurgent superradiant pulses. However, if the co-rotating coupling is larger, then the counter-lasing phase must emerge via the steady-state superradiant phase. Such a transition is the result of the competition of the coherent and incoherent processes that drive superradiance and counter-lasing, respectively. We observe a surprisingly complex transition between the two, associated with the formation of a chaotic attractor over a thin transitional parameter region. ",

Its layered architecture plays a key role for new materials such as Van der Waals heterostructures. The layered structure has also unique implications for hosted, optically active defect centers. A very special type of defect center arises from the possibility to host mechanically isolated orbitals localized between the layers. The resulting absence of coupling to low-frequency acoustic phonons turns out to be the essential element to protect the coherence of optical transitions from mechanical interactions with the environment. Consequently, the spectral transition linewidth remains unusually narrow even at room temperature, thus paving a new way towards coherent quantum optics under ambient conditions. In this review, I summarize the state-of-the-art of defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride with a focus on optically coherent defect centers. I discuss the current understanding of the defect centers, remaining questions and potential research directions to overcome pervasive challenges.
