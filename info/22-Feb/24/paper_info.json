    "title": "Nonlinear optical processes in centrosymmetric systems by  strong-coupling-induced symmetry breaking",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear optical processes associated with even-order nonlinear susceptibilities are critical for both classical and quantum technologies. Inversion symmetry, however, prevents nonlinear optical responses mediated by even-order susceptibilities in several material systems pertinent for applications in nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate induced nonlinear optical processes, namely second- and fourth-harmonic generation that are naturally forbidden in an inversion symmetric system, by strongly coupling to a photon mode of a high-Q optical cavity. As an illustrative system with an inversion symmetry, we consider a semiconductor quantum ring of GaAs that features a single effective electron. For the coupled system, we control the inversion symmetry breaking by changing the light-matter coupling strength which at the same time allows to tune the nonlinear conversion efficiency. We find that the harmonic generation yield can be significantly increased by increasing the light-matter coupling strength in an experimentally feasible way. In the few-photon limit where the incident pump field is a coherent state with just a few photons, we find that the harmonic conversion efficiency is increased for strong coupling as opposed to using intense pump fields. This new approach is applicable to a wide variety of centrosymmetric systems as the symmetry breaking rest on the properties of the photonic environment used to achieve strong light-matter interaction. Our work constitutes a step forward in the direction of realizing physically forbidden nonlinear optical processes in centrosymmetric materials widely adopted for applications in integrated photonics.

    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of unsteady partial cavitation on the fluid-structure interaction of a freely vibrating hydrofoil section at high Reynolds numbers. We consider an elastically-mounted NACA66 hydrofoil section that is free to vibrate in the transverse flow direction. Cavitating flow dynamics coupled with the transverse vibration are studied at low angles of attack. For the numerical study, we employ a recently developed unified variational fluid-structure interaction framework based on homogeneous mixture-based cavitation with hybrid URANS-LES turbulence modeling. We first validate the numerical implementation against experimental data for turbulent cavitating flow. For freely oscillating hydrofoil, we observe large-amplitude vibrations during unsteady partial cavitating conditions that are absent in the non-cavitating flow. We identify a frequency lock-in phenomenon as the main source of sustained large-amplitude vibration whereby the unsteady lift forces lock into a sub-harmonic of the hydrofoil natural frequency. During cavity collapse and shedding, we find a periodic generation of clockwise vorticity, leading to unsteady lift generation. We determine the origin of this flow unsteadiness near the trailing edge of the hydrofoil via the interplay between the growing cavity and adverse pressure gradient. The flow-induced structural vibration is observed to have a consequent impact on the cavity dynamics. In the frequency lock-in regime, large coherent cavitating structures are seen over the hydrofoil suction surface undergoing a full cavity growth-detachment-collapse cycle. For the post-lock-in regime, cavity length is shorter and the attached cavity is observed to undergo high frequency spatially localized oscillations. In this regime, cavity shedding is primarily limited to the cavity trailing end and frequency of a complete cavity detachment and shedding event is reduced. ",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a nonlinear photomodulation spectroscopy method to image the mode profile of a high-Q photonic crystal resonator (PhCR). This is done by scanning the PhCR surface with a 405~nm pump beam that modulates the refractive index by local thermal tuning, while probing the response of the resonance. We increase resolution by probing at high power, using the thermo-optical nonlinear response of the PhCR. Spatial resolution of the thermo-optical effect is typically constrained by the broad thermal profile of the optical pump. Here we increase the resolution and show that we can approach the diffraction limit of the pump light. This is due to free carrier absorption that heats up the PhCR only when there is overlap between the optical pump spot and the optical mode profile. This is supported with a thermo-optical model that reproduces the high-resolution mode mapping. Results reveal that the observed enhanced resolution is reached for surprisingly low carrier density.

    "abstract": "Modeling water flow in unsaturated soils is vital for describing various hydrological and ecological phenomena. Soil water dynamics is described by well-established physical laws (Richardson-Richards equation (RRE)). Solving the RRE is difficult due to the inherent non-linearity of the processes, and various numerical methods have been proposed to solve the issue. However, applying the methods to practical situations is challenging because they require well-defined initial and boundary conditions. Here, we present a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) method that approximates the solution to the RRE using neural networks while concurrently matching available soil moisture data. Although the ability of PINNs to solve partial differential equations, including the RRE, has been demonstrated previously, its potential applications and limitations are not fully known. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of PINNs and carefully tested the accuracy of the solutions by comparing them with analytical solutions and accepted traditional numerical solutions. We demonstrated that the solutions by PINNs with adaptive activation functions are comparable with those by traditional methods. We showed that soil moisture dynamics in layered soils with discontinuous hydraulic conductivities are correctly simulated by PINNs with domain decomposition. We demonstrated that the unspecified upper boundary condition can be estimated from sparse soil moisture measurements. Nevertheless, there remain challenges that require further development. Chiefly, PINNs are sensitive to the initialization of NNs and are significantly slower than traditional numerical methods. ",

Within the past decade, new opportunity for MWP has emerged driven by the advances of integrated photonics. However, despite significant progress made in terms of integration level, a fully on-chip MWP functional system comprising all the necessary photonic and electronic components, is yet to be demonstrated. Here, we break the status quo and provide a complete on-chip solution for MWP system, by exploiting hybrid integration of indium phosphide, silicon photonics and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics platforms. Applying this hybrid integration methodology, a fully chip-based MWP microwave instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) system is experimentally demonstrated. The unprecedented integration level brings great promotion to the compactness, reliability, and performances of the overall MWP IFM system, including a wide frequency measurement range (2-34 GHz), ultralow estimation errors (10.85 MHz) and a fast response speed (0.3 ns). Furthermore, we deploy the chip-scale MWP IFM system into realistic application tasks, where diverse microwave signals with rapid-varying frequencies at X-band (8-12 GHz) are accurately identified in real-time. This demonstration marks a milestone for the development of integrated MWP, by providing the technology basis for the miniaturization and massive implementations of various MWP functional systems. ",

A major bottleneck in applying Fourier Optics in many cases of interest, e.g. when dealing with multiple, or out-of-aperture elements, comes from numerical complexity. In this work, we propose and implement an efficient and differentiable propagation model based on the Collins integral, which enables the optimization of diffraction optical systems with unprecedented design freedom using backpropagation.

We present a comparison of existing acoustic models for tube rows and slits, models for the latter having the advantage of incorporating frequency dependence. We then propose a new model that enables the adaptation of slit models for tube rows. This model is validated against experiments and Linearised Navier Stokes Equations (LNSE) predictions for the transmission and reflection coefficients, including phase information. The model predictions show very good agreement with the experimental and numerical validations, especially for low frequencies (Strouhal number < 0.5, based on tube radius and excitation frequency), with mean differences less than 2% for the transmission coefficients (the reflection coefficient errors are somewhat larger since their magnitudes are very close to zero).

The interaction between a solution under test and the graphene surface causes material and concentration-specific modifications of graphene's DC and AC conductivity. Moreover, wave propagation in the waveguide is modified by the dielectric properties of materials in its close proximity via the fringe field, resulting in a combined sensing mechanism leading to an enhanced S-parameter response compared to metallic microwave sensors. The possibility of further controlling the graphene conductivity via an electrolytic gate enables a new, multi-dimensional approach merging chemical field-effect sensing and microwave measurement methods. By controlling and synchronizing frequency sweeps, electrochemical gating and liquid flow in the microfluidic channel, we generate multidimensional datasets that enable a thorough investigation of the solution under study. As proof of concept, we functionalize the graphene surface in order to identify specific single-stranded DNA sequences dispersed in phosphate buffered saline solution. We achieve a limit of detection of ~1 attomole for a perfect match DNA strand and a sensitivity of ~3 dB/decade for sub-pM concentrations.
