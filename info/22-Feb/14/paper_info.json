    "abstract": "Application of the time-dependent variational principle to a linear combination of frozen-width Gaussians describing the nuclear wavefunction provides a formalism where the total energy is conserved. The computational downside of this formalism is that trajectories of individual Gaussians are solutions of a coupled system of differential equations, limiting implementation to serial propagation algorithms. To allow for parallelization and acceleration of the computation, independent trajectories based on simplified equations of motion were suggested. Unfortunately, within practical realizations involving finite Gaussian bases, this simplification leads to breaking the energy conservation. We offer a solution for this problem by using Lagrange multipliers to ensure the energy and norm conservation regardless of basis function trajectories or basis completeness. We illustrate our approach within the Multi-Configuration Ehrenfest method considering a linear vibronic coupling model. ",

Similar to conventional microwave SQUID multiplexing, our multiplexer relies on inductively coupling non-hysteretic, unshunted rf-SQUIDs to superconducting microwave resonators as well as applying flux ramp modulation for output signal linearization. However, instead of utilizing one resonator per SQUID, we couple multiple SQUIDs to a common readout resonator and encode the SQUID input signals in sidebands of the microwave carrier by varying the flux ramp modulation frequency for each SQUID. We prove the suitability of our approach using a prototype device and argue by means of fundamental information theory that our approach is particularly suited for reading out large cryogenic bolometer arrays.

For Yb, use of the narrow (183 kHz-wide) $^{1\\hspace{-0.3ex}}S_0$-$^{3\\hspace{-0.3ex}}P_1$ transition for simultaneous imaging and cooling has been demonstrated in tweezers with a magic wavelength for the imaging transition. We demonstrate high-fidelity imaging of single Sr atoms using its even narrower (7.4 kHz-wide) $^{1\\hspace{-0.3ex}}S_0$ - $^{3\\hspace{-0.3ex}}P_1$ transition. The atoms are trapped in \\textit{non}-magic-wavelength tweezers. We detect the photons scattered during Sisyphus cooling, thus keeping the atoms near the motional ground state of the tweezer throughout imaging. The fidelity of detection is 0.9991(4) with a survival probability of 0.97(2). An atom in a tweezer can be held under imaging conditions for 79(3) seconds allowing for hundreds of images to be taken, limited mainly by background gas collisions. We detect atoms in an arrary of 36 tweezers with 813.4-nm light and trap depths of 135(20) $\\mu$K. This trap depth is three times shallower than typically used for imaging on the broad $^{1\\hspace{-0.3ex}}S_0$ - $^{1\\hspace{-0.3ex}}P_1$ transition. Narrow-line imaging opens the possibility to even further reduce this trap depth, as long as all trap frequencies are kept larger than the imaging transition linewidth. Imaging using a narrow-linewidth transition in a non-magic-wavelength tweezer also allows for selective imaging of a given tweezer. As a demonstration, we selectively image (hide) a single tweezer from the array. This provides a useful tool for quantum error correction protocols. ",

    "abstract": "It is a generally accepted idea that the particle size distribution strongly affects the optical spectra of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles. It is often quoted as one of the main reasons while explaining the mismatch between the theoretical and experimental optical spectra of such nanoparticles. In this work, these aspects are critically analyzed by means of a bottom up statistical approach that considers variables such as mean, standard deviation and skewness of the nanoparticle size distribution independently from one another. By assuming normal and log-normal distributions of the particle size, the effect of the statistical parameters on the Mie analytical optical spectra of colloidal nanoparticles was studied. The effect of morphology was also studied numerically in order to understand to what extent it can play a role. It is our finding that the particle polydispersity, skewness and surface morphology in fact only weakly impact the optical spectra. While, the selection of suitable optical constants with regard to the crystallinity of the nanoparticles is a far more influential factor for correctly predicting both the plasmon band position and the plasmon bandwidth in theoretical simulations of the optical spectra. It is shown that the mean particle size can be correctly estimated directly from the plasmon band position, as it is the mean that determines the resonance wavelength. The standard deviation can on the other hand be estimated from the intensity distribution data obtained from dynamic light scattering experiments. The results reported herein clear the ambiguity around particle size distribution and optical response of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles. ",

They describe accurately the domain of applicability of the Quantum Mechanics of Coulomb Charges (QMCC) for energies (2-3 significant digits (s.d.)) of the spin-quartet state $1^40^+$ of Li-like ions (in static approximation with point-like, infinitely heavy nuclei). Variational parameters are fitted in $Z$ by 2nd degree polynomials.

Critical charge $Z=Z_B$, where the ultra-compact trial function for the $1^40^+$ state looses its square-integrability, is estimated, $Z_B(1^4\\,0^+) \\sim 1.26 - 1.30$. As a complement to Part I, square integrability for the compact functions constructed for the {\\it ground, spin-doublet state} $1^2\\,0^+$ of the Li-like sequence is discussed. The critical charge, for which these functions stop to be normalizable, is estimated as $Z_B( 1^2\\,0^+) = 1.62 - 1.65$.

We demonstrate the ability to retrieve images with micrometre-scale depth features with a photon flux as small as 7 photon pairs per frame. Using a single photon avalanche diode camera we measure both the bunched and anti-bunched photon-pair distributions at the HOM interferometer output which are combined to provide a lower-noise image of the sample.

The progress of quantum device technology, marked by improvements of characteristic coherence times and extensible architectures for quantum control, has coincided with the development of such dissipation engineering tools which interface quantum and classical degrees of freedom.

We have carried out a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the repumper-induced differential light shifts affecting the Raman resonance, dependent on intensity and detuning.

Their 4f-4f transitions are shielded by filled 5s and 5p orbitals, offering a degree of protection from external electric fields. Embedded within a thin film oxide host, REIs could enable a qubit platform with significant memory capabilities. Furthermore, a silicon-compatible thin film form factor would enable the use of standard semiconductor fabrication processes to achieve chip-based integrability and scalability for functional quantum networks. Towards this goal, we have carried out optical and microstructural studies of erbium-doped polycrystalline and epitaxial TiO$_2$ thin films on Si (100), r-sapphire, and SrTiO$_3$ (100). We observe that the inhomogeneous optical linewidth of the Er photoluminescence is comparable or better for polycrystalline Er:TiO$_2$(grown on Si) in comparison to single crystal epitaxial films on sapphire or SrTiO$_3$, implying a relative insensitivity to extended defects. We investigated the effect of the film/substrate and film/air interface and found that the inhomogeneous linewidth and spectral diffusion can be significantly improved via bottom buffer and top capping layers of undoped TiO$_2$. Using such approaches, we obtain inhomogeneous linewidths of 5.2 GHz and spectral diffusivity of 180 GHz in Er:TiO$_2$ /Si(100) films and have demonstrated the engineerability of quantum-relevant properties in these thin films.

We evaluated internal electronic energies by diffusion quantum Monte Carlo, while nuclear quantum motion and anharmonicity have been included by the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Our results show that the long-sought atomic metallic hydrogen, predicted to host room-temperature superconductivity, forms at $577\\pm 10$ GPa ($640\\pm 14$ GPa in deuterium). Indeed, anharmonicity pushes the stability of this phase towards pressures much larger than previous theoretical estimates or attained experimental values.
