    "abstract": "We study acoustic wave propagation in a waveguide loaded with two resonant side-branch channels. In the low frequency regime, one-dimensional models are derived in which the effect of the channels are reduced to jump conditions across the junction. When the separation distance is on the scale of the wavelength, which is the case that is usually considered, the jump conditions involve a single channel and acoustically induced transparency (AIT) occurs due to out-of-phase interferences between the two junctions. In contrast, when the separation distance is subwavelength, a single junction has to be considered and the jump conditions account for the evanescent field coupling the two channels. Such channel pairs can scatter as a dipole resulting in perfect transmission due to Autler - Townes splitting (ATS). We show that combining the two mechanisms offers additional degrees of freedom to control the transmission spectra. ",

    "abstract": "Light-actuated motors, vehicles, and even space sails have drawn tremendous attention for basic science and applications in space, biomedical, and sensing domains. Optical bound states in the continuum (BIC) are topological singularities of the scattering matrix, known for their unique light trapping capability and enhanced light-matter interaction. We show that BIC modes enable the generation of enhanced and tunable optical forces and torques. A sharp and controllable lineshape is observed in forces and torques spectra when approaching high-Q resonance BIC modes. Wavelength and polarization tunability are presented as an effective method to control the forces on BIC enclosed structures. Finally Finite-size simulations are performed to evaluate the practical application for a BIC assisted metavehicle. ",

    "abstract": "We rigorously assess the potential for extracting high-resolution, multi-mode surface wave dispersion data from distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) measurements using active-source multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW). We have utilized both highly-controlled, broadband vibroseis shaker trucks and more-variable, narrow-band sledgehammer sources to excite the near surface, and compare the DAS-derived dispersion data obtained from both source types directly with concurrently acquired traditional geophone-derived dispersion data. We find that the differences between the two sensing approaches are minimal and well within the dispersion uncertainty bounds associated with each individual measurement type when the following conditions are met for DAS: (a) a tight-buffered or strain-sensing fiber-optic cable is used, (b) the cable is buried in a shallow trench to enhance coupling, and (c) short gauge lengths and small channel separations are used. We also show that frequency-dependent normalization of the dispersion image following MASW processing removes the effects of scaling, integration, and differentiation on the measured waveforms, thereby allowing nearly identical dispersion data to be extracted from geophone waveforms and DAS waveforms without requiring them to first be converted into equivalent units. We demonstrate that the short wavelength DAS dispersion measurements are limited by both the gauge length and the more commonly considered channel separation. We further show that it is possible to extract essentially equivalent surface wave dispersion data from seismic measurements made using a traditional geophone array or two different DAS cables. Finally, we show that shear wave velocity profiles recovered from the DAS data using an uncertainty-consistent, multi-mode inversion agree favorably with cone penetration tests performed at the site.

    "abstract": "Multimode integrated interferometers have great potential for both spectral engineering and metrological applications. However, material dispersion of integrated platforms constitutes an obstacle which limits the performance and precision of such interferometers. At the same time, two-colour non-linear interferometers present an important tool for metrological applications, when measurements in a certain frequency range are difficult. In this manuscript, we theoretically develop and investigate an integrated multimode two-colour SU(1,1) interferometer that operates in a supersensitive mode. By ensuring a proper design of the integrated platform, we suppress dispersion and thereby significantly increase the visibility of the interference pattern. We demonstrate that such an interferometer overcomes the classical phase sensitivity limit for wide parametric gain ranges, when up to $3*10^4$ photons are generated. ",

    "abstract": "As standard microelectronic technology approaches fundamental limitations in speed and power consumption, novel computing strategies are strongly needed. Analog optical computing enables processing large amounts of data at a negligible energy cost and high speeds. Based on these principles, ultrathin optical metasurfaces have been recently explored to process large images in real-time, in particular for edge detection. By incorporating feedback, it has also been recently shown that metamaterials can be tailored to solve complex mathematical problems in the analog domain, although these efforts have so far been limited to guided-wave systems and bulky setups. Here, we present an ultrathin Si metasurface-based platform for analog computing that is able to solve Fredholm integral equations of the second kind using free-space visible radiation. A Si-based metagrating was inverse-designed to implement the scattering matrix synthesizing a prescribed Kernel corresponding to the mathematical problem of interest. Next, a semi-transparent mirror was incorporated into the sample to provide adequate feedback and thus perform the required Neumann series, solving the corresponding equation in the analog domain at the speed of light. Visible wavelength operation enables a highly compact, ultrathin device that can be interrogated from free-space, implying high processing speeds and the possibility of on-chip integration. ",

    "abstract": "Entanglement exhibits universal behavior near the ground-state critical point where correlations are long-ranged and the thermodynamic entropy is vanishing. On the other hand, a quantum quench imparts extensive energy and results in a build-up of entropy, hence no critical behavior is expected at long times. In this work, we present a new paradigm in the quench dynamics of integrable spin chains which exhibit a ground-state order-disorder phase transition at a critical line. Specifically, we consider a quench along the critical line which displays a volume-law behavior of the entropy and exponentially decaying correlations; however, we show that quantum criticality is hidden in higher-order correlations and becomes manifest via measures such as the mutual information and logarithmic negativity. Furthermore, we showcase the scale-invariance of the R\\'{e}nyi mutual information between disjoint regions as further evidence for genuine critical behavior. We attribute the emerging universality to the vanishing effective temperature of the soft mode in spite of the quench. Our results are amenable to an experimental realization on different quantum simulator platforms, particularly the Rydberg simulators. ",

The slab waveguide-enhanced photoluminescence of several defect species is used to study recombination and diffusion in the presence of thermal annealing with both rapid quench cooling and a longer return to ambient conditions. The confined mechanical geometry of the thin film is exploited to measure the spin-strain coupling of the negatively charged silicon monovacancy. The methods in this work can be used to exercise greater control on near-surface emitters in silicon carbide and better understand and control the effects of strain on spin measurements of silicon carbide based color centers.
