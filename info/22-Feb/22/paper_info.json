    "title": "Power-efficient soliton microcombs",
    "abstract": "Laser frequency combs are enabling some of the most exciting scientific endeavours in the 21st century, ranging from the development of optical clocks to the calibration of the astronomical spectrographs used for searching Earth-like exoplanets. Today, dissipative Kerr solitons generated in microresonators offer the prospect of attaining frequency combs in miniaturized systems by capitalizing on advances in photonic integration. Most of the applications based on soliton microcombs rely on tuning a continuous-wave laser into a longitudinal mode of a microresonator whose dimensions are engineered to display anomalous dispersion at the pump laser frequency. In this configuration, however, nonlinear physics precludes from attaining dissipative Kerr solitons with high power conversion efficiency, with typical comb powers amounting to ~1% of the available laser power. Here, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by inducing a controllable frequency shift to a selected cavity resonance. Experimentally, we realize this shift using two linearly coupled anomalous-dispersion microresonators (a photonic molecule), resulting in a coherent dissipative Kerr soliton with a conversion efficiency exceeding 50% and excellent line spacing stability. We describe the physical soliton dynamics in this configuration, and discover the system displays unusual characteristics, such as the possibility to backwards initiate solitons and stable operation with a blue detuned pump laser. By optimizing the microcomb power available on chip, these results facilitate the practical implementation of a scalable integrated photonic architecture for energy-efficient applications. ",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging of the retina, also termed as optoretinography (ORG), promises a noninvasive method for objective assessment of retinal function. By providing unparalleled capability to differentiate individual layers of the retina, functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been actively investigated for intrinsic signal ORG measurements. However, clinical deployment of functional OCT for quantitative ORG is still challenging due to the lack of a standardized imaging protocol and the complication of IOS sources and mechanisms. This article aims to summarize recent developments of functional OCT for ORG measurement, OCT intensity- and phase-based IOS processing.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient parallel radiative transfer-based inverse-problem solver for time-domain optical tomography. The radiative transfer equation provides a physically accurate model for the transport of photons in biological tissue, but the high computational cost associated with its solution has hindered its use in time-domain optical-tomography and other areas. In this paper this problem is tackled by means of a number of computational and modeling innovations, including 1) A spatial parallel-decomposition strategy with perfect parallel scaling for the forward and inverse problems of optical tomography on parallel computer systems; and, 2) A Multiple Staggered Source method (MSS) that solves the inverse transport problem at a computational cost that is independent of the number of sources employed, and which significantly accelerates the reconstruction of the optical parameters: a six-fold MSS acceleration factor is demonstrated in this paper. Finally, this contribution presents 3) An intuitive derivation of the adjoint-based formulation for evaluation of functional gradients, including the highly-relevant general Fresnel boundary conditions -- thus, in particular, generalizing results previously available for vacuum boundary conditions. Solutions of large and realistic 2D inverse problems are presented in this paper, which were produced on a 256-core computer system. The combined parallel/MSS acceleration approach reduced the required computing times by several orders of magnitude, from months to a few hours. ",

The instantaneous fluctuations in the frequencies of the O-H stretch modes are calculated using the wavelet method of time series analysis, while the time scales of vibrational spectral diffusion are determined from frequency-time correlation functions and joint probability distributions, as well as the hydrogen bond number correlation functions. We find that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects leads not only to a redshift in the vibrational frequency distribution by about 120~cm$^{-1}$ for both the bulk and interfacial water molecules, but also to an acceleration of the vibrational dynamics on the water-air interface by as much as 60$\\%$. In addition, a blueshift of about 30 ~cm$^{-1}$ is seen in the vibrational frequency distribution of interfacial water molecules compared to that of the bulk. Furthermore, the dynamics of water molecules beyond the topmost two molecular layers was found to be essentially similar to that of bulk water. ",

Despite a linear regime of light-to-heat conversion is well-studied both for metal and semiconductor resonant systems generalized as critical coupling condition, the clear strategy to optimize optical heating upon high-intensity light irradiation is still missing. In this work, we propose a simple analytical model for such problem taking into account material properties changes caused by the heating. It allows us to derive a new general critical coupling condition for the nonlinear case, requiring counterintuitive initial spectral mismatch between the pumping light frequency and resonant one. Basing on the suggested strategy, we develop an optimized design for efficient nonlinear optical heating, which employs a cylindrical nanoparticle supporting quasi bound state in the continuum mode (quasi-BIC or so-called `super-cavity mode') excited by the incident azimuthal vector beam. Our approach provides a background for various nonlinear experiments related to optical heating and bistability, where self-action of the intense laser beam can change resonant properties of the irradiated nanostructure.

    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs based on semiconductor lasers are a promising technology for monolithic integration of dual-comb spectrometers. However, the stabilization of the offset frequency fceo remains a challenging feat due the lack of octave-spanning spectra. In a dual-comb configuration, the uncorrelated jitter of the offset frequencies leads to a non-periodic signal resulting in broadened beatnotes with a limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, expensive data acquisition schemes and complex signal processing are currently required. Here, we show that the offset frequencies of two frequency combs can be synchronized by optical injection locking, which allows full phase-stabilization when combined with electrical injection. A single comb line isolated via an optical Vernier filter serves as Master oscillator for injection locking. The resulting dual-comb signal is periodic and stable over thousands of periods. This enables coherent averaging using analog electronics, which increases the SNR and reduces the data size by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively. The presented method will enable fully phase-stabilized dual-comb spectrometers by leveraging on integrated optical filters and provides access for measuring and stabilizing fceo. ",

We demonstrate the deterministic generation of the single-solitons that span 1.5-octaves, i.e., near 200 THz, via adiabatic pump wavelength tuning. The ultra-wide soliton existence ranges up to 17 GHz not only suggests the robustness of the system but will also extend the applications of soliton combs. Moreover, the proposed scheme is found to easily give rise to multi-solitons as well as the soliton crystals featuring enhanced repetition rate (2 and 3 THz) and conversion efficiency greater than 10%.

    "abstract": "Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) can be used to probe how quickly a quantum system scrambles information when the initial conditions of the dynamics are changed. In sufficiently large quantum systems, one can extract from the OTOC the quantum analog of the Lyapunov coefficient that describes the time scale on which a classical chaotic system becomes scrambled. OTOCs have been applied only to a very limited number of toy models, such as the SYK model connected with black hole information scrambling, but they could find much wider applicability for information scrambling in quantum systems that allow comparison with experiments. The vibrations of polyatomic molecules are known to undergo a transition from regular dynamics at low energy to facile energy flow at sufficiently high energy. Molecules therefore represent ideal quantum systems to study scrambling in many-body systems of moderate size (here 6 to 36 degrees of freedom). By computing quantum OTOCs and their classical counterparts we quantify how information becomes 'scrambled' quantum mechanically in molecular systems. Between early 'ballistic' dynamics, and late 'saturation' of the OTOC when the full density of states is explored, there is indeed a regime where a quantum Lyapunov coefficient can be defined for all molecules in this study. Comparison with experimental rate data shows that slow scrambling as measured by the OTOC can reach the time scale of molecular reaction dynamics. Even for the smallest molecules we discuss, the Maldacena bound remains satisfied by regularized OTOCs, but not by unregularized OTOCs, highlighting that the former are more useful for discussing information scrambling in this type of moderate-size quantum system.

In quantum sensing tasks, the user gets $\\rho_\\theta$, the quantum state that encodes $\\theta$. They choose a measurement, a positive-operator valued measure (POVM) $\\Pi_l$, which induces the channel $P_{l|\\theta} = {\\rm Tr}(\\rho_\\theta \\Pi_l)$ to the measurement outcome $l$, on which the aforesaid classical MMSE estimator is employed. Personick found the optimum POVM $\\Pi_l$ that minimizes the MMSE over all possible measurements, and that MMSE. This result from 1971 is less-widely known than the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which lower bounds the variance of an unbiased estimator over all measurements, when $P_\\theta$ is unavailable. For multi-parameter estimation, i.e., when $\\theta$ is a vector, in Fisher quantum estimation theory, the inverse of the QFI matrix provides an operator lower bound to the covariance of an unbiased estimator. However, there has been little work on quantifying quantum limits and measurement designs, for multi-parameter quantum estimation in the {\\em Bayesian} setting. In this paper, we build upon Personick's result to construct a Bayesian adaptive measurement scheme for multi-parameter estimation when $N$ copies of $\\rho_\\theta$ are available. We illustrate an application to localizing a cluster of point emitters in a highly sub-Rayleigh angular field-of-view, an important problem in fluorescence microscopy and astronomy. Our algorithm translates to a multi-spatial-mode transformation prior to a photon-detection array, with electro-optic feedback to adapt the mode sorter.

    "abstract": "We recently proposed effective normal modes for excitonically coupled aggregates which exactly transform the energy transfer Hamiltonian into a sum of one-dimensional Hamiltonians along the effective normal modes. Identifying physically meaningful vibrational motions which maximally promote vibronic mixing suggested an interesting possibility of leveraging vibrational-electronic resonance for mediating selective energy transfer. Here we expand on the effective mode approach elucidating its iterative nature for successively larger aggregates, and extend the idea of mediated energy transfer to larger aggregates. We show that energy transfer between electronically uncoupled but vibronically resonant donor-acceptor sites does not depend on the intermediate site energy or the number of intermediate sites. The intermediate sites simply mediate electronic coupling such that vibronic coupling along specific promoter modes leads to direct donor-acceptor energy transfer bypassing any intermediate uphill energy transfer steps. We show that interplay between the electronic Hamiltonian and the effective mode transformation partitions the linear vibronic coupling along specific promoter modes to dictate the selectivity of mediated energy transfer, with a vital role of interference between vibronic couplings and multi-particle basis states. Our results suggest a general design principle for enhancing energy transfer through synergistic effects of vibronic resonance and weak mediated electronic coupling, where both effects individually do not promote efficient energy transfer. The effective mode approach proposed here paves a facile route towards four-wavemixing spectroscopy simulations of larger aggregates without severely approximating resonant vibronic coupling. ",

Future applications demand flexible architectures which overcome common limitations of many current devices, for instance the lack of tuneabilty or built-in quantum light sources. Here, we report on a dynamically reconfigurable integrated photonic circuit comprising integrated quantum dots (QDs), a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) transducers fabricated on a monolithic semiconductor platform. We demonstrate on-chip single photon generation by the QD, initializing a photonic qubit. Two independently applied SAWs piezo-optomechanically rotates the single photon in the MZI or spectrally modulated the QD emission wavelength. In the MZI, SAWs imprint a time-dependent optical phase and modulate the qubit rotation to the output superposition state. This enables dynamic single photon routing with frequencies exceeding one gigahertz. Finally, the combination of the dynamic single photon control and spectral tuning of the QD realizes wavelength multiplexing of the input state and demultiplexing at the output. Our approach is scalable to multi-component integrated quantum photonic circuits and is compatible with hybrid photonic architectures and other key components for instance photonic resonators or on-chip detectors.

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces are believed as one of the best candidates in nano-optical devices, attributed to the key feasible modulation features of phase, polarization, and local field enhancement by structural designing. However, current methods of propagation- and geometric-phase modulation are interrelated between two eigen spin-states. This means that when the left-handed component phase of a beam is modulated by metasurfaces, its right-handed component phase will change accordingly, which limits the versatility of spin-decoupled applications. In this paper, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate a new phase modulation pathway based on chiral V-shaped holes, which enable fully decoupled one-handed phase modulation of the two eigen spin-states. Two enantiomers are proposed to realize decoupled functions for the two eign-states, e.g., the enantiomer can manipulate the left-handed component phase of a laser beam without changes of the right-handed component. This proposed method has significant meaning in metasurfaces, which can expand the methods of phase engineering. ",

The approach is based on a coordinate transformation between a moving physical domain and a fixed computational domain. This allows to simulate the combined effects of wave profile distortion due to the constitutive nonlinearity of the medium and the nonlinear Doppler modulation of a pressure wave due to the acceleration of the wave emitting boundary. A predictor-corrector method is employed to enhance the numerical stability of the method in the presence of shocks and grid motion. It is demonstrated that the method can accurately predict the Doppler shift of nonlinear wave distortion and the amplitude modulation caused by an oscillating motion of the wave emitting boundary. The novelty of the presented methodology lies in its capability to reflect the Doppler shift of the rate of nonlinear wave profile distortion and shock attenuation for finite amplitude acoustic waves emitted from an accelerating boundary.

In this work, we demonstrate how subwavelength modifications to a conventional silicon nanodisk enable strong sub-diffractive and polarization dependent field enhancements in devices supporting anapole-like modes. We examine the electromagnetic properties of both individual and arrayed diabolo nanodisks, which are found to exhibit |E|$^2$/|E$_0$|$^2$ enhancements in the range ~10$^2$-10$^4$, in the high index medium, depending on geometrical considerations. In addition to supporting a localized electric field hot-spot similar to those predicted in diabolo nanostructured photonic crystal cavities and waveguide designs, we identify an anti-diabolo effect leading to a broadband cold-spot for the orthogonal polarization. These findings offer the prospect of enhancing or manipulating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale within an all-dielectric (metal free) platform for potential applications ranging from nonlinear optics to quantum light sources, nano-sensing, nanoparticle-manipulation and active/tunable metasurfaces.

In addition, the task of discriminating whether there are one or two sources followed by detecting the faint emission of a secondary source in the proximity of a much brighter one is in itself a severe challenge for direct imaging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two tasks for superresolution imaging based on quantum state discrimination and quantum imaging techniques. We show that one can significantly reduce the probability of error for detecting the presence of a weak secondary source, especially when the two sources have small angular separations. In this work, we reduce the experimental complexity down to a single two-mode interferometer: we show that (1) this simple set-up is sufficient for the state discrimination task, and (2) if the two sources are of equal brightness, then this measurement can super-resolve their angular separation, saturating the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound. By using a collection baseline of 5.3~mm, we resolve the angular separation of two sources that are placed 15~$\\mu$m apart at a distance of 1.0~m with an accuracy of $1.7\\%$--this is between 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes more accurate than shot-noise limited direct imaging.

It is based on a striking effect where two nonlinear crystals, by sharing a coherent pump and one of two output beams each, can induce correlations between the other two individual, non-interacting beams. This can be thought of as a type of quantum-erasure effect, where the ``welcher-weg'' (which-way), or in this case ``which-source'' information is erased when the shared beams are aligned. With the correct geometry this effect can allow an object to be imaged using only photons which have never interacted with the object -- in other words the image is formed using undetected photons. Interest in this and related setups has been accelerating in recent years due to a number of desirable properties, mostly centered around the fact that the fields for detection and imaging (since separate) may have different optical properties, entailing significant advantages to various applications. The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce researchers to this area of research, to provide practical tools for setting up experiments as well as understanding the underlying theory, and to also provide a comprehensive overview of the sub-field as a whole.

After leaving 15 solar radii and in the absence of triggered ion acoustic waves at greater distances, the core electron temperature varied with radial distance, R, in solar radii, as 1900R-4/3 electron volts because of cooling produced by the adiabatic expansion. The coefficient, 1900, reproduces the minimum core electron perpendicular temperature observed during the 25 days of observation. In the presence of triggered ion acoustic waves, the core electrons were isotropically heated as much as a factor of two above the minimum temperature, 1900R-4/3 eV. Triggered ion acoustic waves were the only waves observed in coincidence with the electron core heating.
