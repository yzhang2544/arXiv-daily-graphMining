    "abstract": "We demonstrate the use of Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to both accelerate and scale up density functional theory (DFT) calculations of electronic structure. Utilizing 512 TPU v3 cores, we perform the largest $O(N^3)$ DFT computation to date, with $N = 247\\,848$ orbitals, corresponding to a cluster of over $10\\,000$ water molecules with more than $100\\,000$ electrons. A full TPU v3 pod (2048 TPU v3 cores) and a TPU v4 pod (8192 TPU v4 cores) are projected to handle up to $N \\approx 500\\,000$ and $N \\approx 1\\,000\\,000$ orbitals respectively. Lower-scaling (e.g. linear-scaling) variants of DFT can consider even larger numbers of orbitals, although they often only work for restricted classes of systems, such as insulating systems, require additional approximations and incur increased code complexity. As a result, when computationally affordable, cubic-scaling DFT as considered here is preferable due to its algorithmic simplicity and more general applicability. Our work thus paves the way towards systematic use of conventional -- and more broadly and straightforwardly applicable -- $O(N^3)$ DFT at unprecedented scales, with potential impact in areas such as quantum chemistry, drug discovery, materials science, and nanotechnology.

Such excellent performance can be achieved by the synergetic effect of enhancement in visible light absorption capacity and photo-excited carrier separation because of the highly concentrated surface defects and the specific Ti/TiOx core/shell structure, respectively.

We demonstrate the properties of nonlinear electromagnetic wave in a two-dimensional rectangular cavity by calculating the nonlinear correction for two classical standing waves. We apply the linear approximation in a short timescale. A part of the nonlinear correction increases with time. In particular, a one-dimensional second harmonic grows if the cavity size satisfies a specific condition. We also analyze the nonlinear electromagnetic wave in a timescale longer than the applicable limit of the linear approximation. We formulate the self-modulation of the amplitude and phase, including the effect of static magnetic flux density. In the viewpoint of energy flow between the two modes of the standing wave, the behavior of nonlinear electromagnetic wave can be classified into three types. Namely, the energy flow keeps oscillating, eventually decreases to zero, or never occurs. ",

Pixelated LGADs have been proposed for the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) and for the Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) of the ATLAS and CMS experiments, respectively. The drawback of segmenting an LGAD is the non-gain area between pixels and the consequent reduction in the fill factor. In this sense, inverse LGAD (iLGAD) technology has been proposed by IMB-CNM to enhance the fill factor and to reach excellent tracking capabilities. In this work, we explore the use of iLGAD sensors for X-Ray applications by developing a new generation of iLGADs. The periphery of the first iLGAD generation is optimized by means of TCAD tools, making them suitable for X-Ray irradiations thanks to the double side optimization. The fabricated iLGAD sensors exhibit good electrical performances before and after an X-Ray irradiation. The second iLGAD generation is able to withstand the same voltage, as contrary to the first iLGAD generation after irradiation. ",

    "abstract": "Numerous molecules exhibit unique absorption bands in the fingerprint infrared (IR) region, allowing chemical identification and detection. This makes IR spectroscopy an essential tool in biomedical diagnostics, sensing, and material characterization. However, measurements in the IR range are challenging due to the relatively poor performance, need for cryogenic cooling, and high cost of IR light sources and photodetectors. Here, we demonstrate that the mid-IR fingerprints of the sample can be revealed from measurements in the near-IR range using conventional silicon photodetectors. Our approach relies on the quantum interference of correlated photon pairs produced in strongly frequency non-degenerate parametric down-conversion. Our technique simultaneously measures the absorption coefficient and refractive index in the broad fingerprint region with high accuracy. As a proof-of-concept, we perform spectroscopy of nitrous oxide gas in the 7.4-8.4 {\\mu}m wavelength range, with the detection in the 865-877 nm range. This work extends the applicability of quantum interferometry to a range of broad practical appeals, such as detection of atmosphere pollutants, breath diagnostics, chemical safety, and others. ",

    "abstract": "III-nitride quantum dots (QDs) are a promising system actively studied for their ability to maintain single photon emission up to room temperature. Here, we report on the evolution of the emission properties of self-assembled GaN/AlN QDs for temperatures ranging from 5 to 300K. We carefully track the photoluminescence of a single QD and measure an optimum single photon purity of g(2)(0) = 0.05+-0.02 at 5 K and 0.17+-0.8 at 300 K. We complement this study with temperaturedependent time-resolved photoluminescence measurements (TRPL) performed on a QD ensemble to further investigate the exciton recombination dynamics of such polar zero-dimensional nanostructures. By comparing our results to past reports, we emphasize the complexity of recombination processes in this system. Instead of the more conventional mono-exponential decay typical of exciton recombination, TRPL transients display a bi-exponential feature with short- and long-lived components that persist in the low excitation regime. From the temperature insensitivity of the long-lived excitonic component, we first discard the interplay of dark-to-bright state refilling in the exciton recombination process. Besides, this temperature-invariance also highlights the absence of nonradiative exciton recombinations, a likely direct consequence of the strong carrier confinement observed in GaN/AlN QDs up to 300K. Overall, our results support the viability of these dots as a potential single-photon source for quantum applications at room temperature. ",

Extending optical cycling to structurally complex molecules would provide new capabilities in these areas, as well as in ultracold chemistry. Increased molecular complexity, however, makes realizing closed optical transitions more difficult. Building on the already established strong optical cycling of diatomic, linear triatomic, and symmetric top molecules, recent theoretical and experimental work has indicated that cycling will be extendable to phenol containing molecules, as well as other asymmetric species. The paradigm for these systems is the use of an optical cycling center bonded to a molecular ligand. Theory has suggested that cycling may be extended to even larger ligands, like naphthalene, pyrene and coronene. Here, we study the optical excitation and vibrational branching of the molecules CaO-2-naphthyl, SrO-2-naphthyl and CaO-1-naphthyl and find only weak decay to excited vibrational states, indicating a promising path to full quantum control and laser cooling of large arene-based molecules.

    "abstract": "We stabilize an open cavity flow experiment to 1% of its original fluctuation level. For the first time, a multi-modal feedback control is automatically learned for this configuration. The key enabler is automatic in-situ optimization of control laws with machine learning augmented by a gradient descent algorithm, named gradient-enriched machine learning control (Cornejo Maceda et al. 2021, gMLC). gMLC is shown to learn one order of magnitude faster than MLC (Duriez et al. 2017, MLC). The physical interpretation of the feedback mechanism is assisted by a novel cluster-based control law visualization for flow dynamics and corresponding actuation commands. Starting point of the control experiment are two unforced open cavity benchmark configurations: a narrow-bandwidth regime with a single dominant frequency and a mode-switching regime where two frequencies compete. The feedback control commands the DBD actuator located at the leading edge. The flow is monitored by a downstream hot-wire sensor over the trailing edge. The feedback law is optimized with respect to the monitored fluctuation level. As reference, the self-oscillations of the mixing layer are mitigated with steady actuation. Then, feedback controller is optimized with gMLC. As expected, feedback control outperforms steady actuation by achieving both, a better amplitude reduction and a significantly smaller actuation power, about about 1% of the actuation energy required for similarly effective steady forcing. Intriguingly, optimized laws learned for one regime performs well for the other untested regime as well. The proposed control strategy can be expected to be applicable for many other shear flow experiments. ",

    "abstract": "An accurate assessment of how quantum computers can be used for chemical simulation, especially their potential computational advantages, provides important context on how to deploy these future devices. In order to perform this assessment reliably, quantum resource estimates must be coupled with classical simulations attempting to answer relevant chemical questions and to define the classical simulation frontier. Herein, we explore the quantum and classical resources required to assess the electronic structure of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and thus define a classical-quantum advantage boundary. This is accomplished by analyzing the convergence of DMRG+NEVPT2 and coupled cluster singles doubles with non-iterative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations for spin-gaps in models of the CYP catalytic cycle that indicate multireference character. The quantum resources required to perform phase estimation using qubitized quantum walks are calculated for the same systems. Compilation into the surface-code provides runtime estimates to compare directly to DMRG runtimes and to evaluate potential quantum advantage. Both classical and quantum resource estimates suggest that simulation of CYP models at scales large enough to balance dynamic and multiconfigurational electron correlation has the potential to be a quantum advantage problem and emphasizes the important interplay between classical simulations and quantum algorithms development for chemical simulation.

We compare the achievable rates of remote entanglement generation for two optical approaches: free space photon collection with a lens and a near-concentric, long working distance resonant cavity. Laser cooling and trapping within the cavity removes the need for mechanical transport of atoms from a source region, which allows for a fast repetition rate.

However, due to the black-box nature of machine learning, it is difficult to analyze what machine learns or why it is powerful. Here, by applying one of the simplest neural networks, the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), to the ground-state representation of the one-dimensional (1D) transverse-field Ising (TFI) model, we make an attempt to directly analyze the optimized network parameters. In the RBM optimization, a zero-temperature quantum state is mapped onto a finite-temperature classical state of the extended Ising spins that constitute the RBM. We find that the quantum phase transition from the ordered phase to the disordered phase in the 1D TFI model by increasing the transverse-field is clearly reflected in the behaviors of the optimized RBM parameters and hence in the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical RBM Ising system. The present finding of a correspondence between the neural-network parameters and quantum phases suggests that a careful investigation of the neural-network parameters may provide a new route to extracting nontrivial physical insights from the neural-network wave functions.
