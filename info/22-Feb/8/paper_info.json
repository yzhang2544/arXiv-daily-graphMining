    "abstract": "Human breath contains hundreds of volatile molecules that can provide powerful, non-intrusive spectral diagnosis of a diverse set of diseases and physiological/metabolic states. To unleash this tremendous potential for medical science, we present a robust analytical method that simultaneously measures tens of thousands of spectral features in each breath sample, followed by efficient and detail-specific multivariate data analysis for unambiguous binary medical response classification. We combine mid-infrared cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS), capable of real-time collection of tens of thousands of distinct molecular features at parts-per-trillion sensitivity, with supervised machine learning, capable of analysis and verification of extremely high-dimensional input data channels. Here, we present the first application of this method to the breath detection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using 170 individual samples at the University of Colorado, we report a cross-validated area under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve of 0.849(4), providing excellent prediction performance. Further, this method detected a significant difference between male and female breath as well as other variables such as smoking and abdominal pain. Together, these highlight the utility of CE-DFCS for rapid, non-invasive detection of diverse biological conditions and disease states. The unique properties of frequency comb spectroscopy thus help establish precise digital spectral fingerprints for building accurate databases and provide means for simultaneous multi-response classifications. The predictive power can be further enhanced with readily scalable comb spectral coverage. ",

Unlike vortices in other physical entities, optical vortices require structural singularities, which restrict their abilities in terms of dynamic and interactive characteristics. In this study, we present the spontaneous generation and external magnetic field-induced manipulation of an optical vortex and antivortex. A gradient-thickness optical cavity (GTOC) consisting of an Al/SiO2/Ni/SiO2 multilayer structure realised the distinct transition between the trivial and non-trivial topological phases, depending on the magneto-optic effects of the Ni layer. In the non-trivial topological phase, the mathematical singularities generating the optical vortex and antivortex pair in the reflected light existed in the generalised parameter space of the thicknesses of the top and bottom SiO2 layers, which is bijective to the real space of the GTOC. Coupled with the magnetisation, the optical vortex and antivortex in the GTOC experienced an effective spin-orbit interaction and showed topology-dependent dynamics under external magnetic fields. We expect that field-induced engineering of optical vortices will pave the way for the study of topological photonic interactions and their applications. ",

It is a challenge to experimentally produce SMs with a required temporal separation in mode-locked fiber lasers. Here, we propose and realize an experimental scenario for harnessing SM dynamics in a laser setup. In particular, we tailor SMs in a mode-locked laser controlled by second-order group-velocity dispersion and dispersion losses: the real part of dispersion maintains the balance between the dispersion and nonlinearity, while the dispersion loss determines the balance of gain and losses. The experimental results demonstrate that the dispersion loss makes it possible to select desired values of the temporal separation (TS) in bound pairs of SMs in the system. Tunability of the SM's central wavelength and the corresponding hysteresis are addressed too. The demonstrated regime allows us to create multiple SMs with preselected values of the TS and central wavelength, which shows the potential of our setup for the design of optical data-processing schemes.

This theory reveals macroscale effect of the azimuthal steady rotation of electrons with a radially inhomogeneous angular velocity, caused by radial inhomogeneity of the helicon electric field. It is found that this sheared rotation as well as the electron density and temperature inhomogeneity are responsible for the development of the high frequency ion acoustic instability of the inhomogeneous cylindrical plasma. This instability is spatially localized in the region of strong gradients of the helicon wave electric field and of the plasma density, where it is more stronger than the parametric instabilities driven by the oscillating motion of the electrons relative to ions in the helicon wave.

For this to occur, electron density should be a few percent of the critical density, while the in-channel electron density should be $\\sim$3 times lower.

The lack of knowledge of the velocity field as well as the initial states provided by measurements lead to an ill-posed problem that cannot be solved by traditional techniques. To this end, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate solutions to such ill-posed problems using only data of the free surface elevation and depth of the water. PINNs can readily incorporate the physical laws and the observational data, thereby enabling inference of the physical quantities of interest. In the present study, both experimental and synthetic (generated by numerical methods) training data are used to train PINNs. Furthermore, multi-fidelity data are used to solve the inverse water wave problem by leveraging both high- and low-fidelity data sets. The applicability of the PINN methodology for the estimation of the impact of water waves onto solid obstacles is demonstrated after deriving the corresponding equations. The present methodology can be employed to efficiently design offshore structures such as oil platforms, wind turbines, etc. by solving the corresponding ill-posed inverse water waves problem. ",

Here, we demonstrate hybrid Kerr and electro-optic microcombs using the lithium niobate thin film that exhibits both Kerr and Pockels nonlinearities. By interleaving the high-repetition-rate Kerr soliton comb with the low-repetition-rate electro-optic comb on the same waveguide, the wide Kerr soliton mode spacing is divided within a single chip, allowing for subsequent electronic detection and feedback control of the soliton repetition rate. Our work establishes an integrated electronic interface to Kerr solitons of terahertz repetition rates, paving the path towards chipscale optical-to-microwave frequency division and comb locking. ",

Different from the traditional charge flow behaviour, non-Abelian signatures emerge when braiding between adjacent band nodal lines occurs, which flips the direction of the frame charge flow. In photonic systems, we discover that the photonic {\\Gamma} point serves as the source or sink of such frame charge flow due to hidden braiding induced by the often-ignored electrostatic mode at zero-frequency. By designing a biaxial photonic crystal, the non-Abelian frame charge flow in momentum space is experimentally demonstrated. ",

Such design criteria are typically derived assuming an infinite metasurface, whereas the absorption characteristics of finite metasurfaces, even very large ones, can be markedly different in certain frequency intervals. This is due to the excitation of surface waves, intrinsic to resonant metasurfaces, and especially meta-resonances, namely collective resonances where the surface waves form standing-wave patterns over the planar metasurface domain. We illustrate this issue using a detailed model of a Helmholtz-type acoustic metasurface formed of cavity-neck pairs embedded into a rigid substrate, with geometric and dissipation effects included from first principles (R.

The combination of electrostatic finite element simulations with a transient Monte Carlo approach provides simultaneous access to precise sensor modelling and high statistics. The high simulation statistics enable the inclusion of Landau fluctuations and production of secondary particles, which offers a realistic simulation scenario. The transient simulation approach is an important tool to achieve an accurate time-resolved description of the sensor, which is crucial in the face of novel detector prototypes with increasingly precise timing capabilities. The simulated time resolution as a function of operating parameters as well as the full transient pulse can be monitored and assessed, which offers a new perspective on the optimisation and characterisation of silicon sensors. In this paper, a combination of electrostatic finite-element simulations using 3D TCAD and transient Monte Carlo simulations with the Allpix Squared framework are presented for a monolithic CMOS pixel sensor with a small collection diode, that is characterised by a highly inhomogeneous, complex electric field. The results are compared to transient 3D TCAD simulations that offer a precise simulation of the transient behaviour but long computation times. Additionally, the simulations are benchmarked against test-beam data and good agreement is found for the performance parameters over a wide range of different operation conditions. ",

In particular, Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) presents a case study that challenges previous expectations and offers an interesting test-bed for further developments. For example, an interest in the nanoscale heterogeneities of hydration dynamics demand increasingly sophisticated and automated measurements deploying ODNP on a modular, open source instrument operating at 15 MHz. ODNP demands the acquisition and automated processing of large quantities of one dimensional NMR spectra, which can present various problems: in particular, unambiguous identification of signal in newly configured instruments presents a practical challenge, while field drift tends to remain an issue even in fully configured instruments. Recent advances in the capabilities of open-source libraries opened up the opportunity to address these issues at the fundamental level, by developing a specific schema that treats the phase cycle of a pulse as an explicit \"phase domain\" dimension that Fourier transforms into the \"coherence domain.\" In particular, a standardized protocol for organizing and visualizing the resulting data clearly presents all the information available from all coherence transfer pathways of a phase-cycled experiment, with intelligible results that don't rely on preliminary phase corrections. It thus organizes and visualizes data in ways that more accurately reflect the rich physics of the underlying NMR experiments, and that more fully bear out the original fundamental concepts of coherence transfer pathways.

This approach is based on the reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT) formulation of the electronic structure problem. For that purpose, the density-matrix functional of the full system is decomposed into an indirectly coupled sum of density-matrix functionals for all its subsystems using the adaptive cluster approximation to RDMFT. The approximations involved in the decomposition and the adaptive cluster approximation itself can be systematically converged to the exact result. The solutions for the density-matrix functionals of the effective subsystems involves a constrained minimization over many-particle states that are approximated by parametrized trial states on the quantum computer similarly to the variational quantum eigensolver. The independence of the density-matrix functionals of the effective subsystems introduces a new level of parallelization and allows for the computational treatment of much larger molecules on a quantum computer with a given qubit count. In addition, for the proposed algorithm techniques are presented to reduce the qubit count, the number of quantum programs, as well as its depth.

    "abstract": "Spin chains can be used to describe a wide range of platforms for quantum computation and quantum information. They enable the understanding, demonstration and modelling of numerous useful phenomena, such as: high fidelity transfer of quantum states; creation and distribution of entanglement; creation of resources for measurement-based quantum processing. In this paper, we study a more complex spin system, a two dimensional Spin Network (SN) engineered by applying suitable unitaries to two uncoupled spin chains. Considering only the single-excitation subspace of the SN, we demonstrate that the system can be operated as a router, directing information through the SN. We also show that it can serve to generate maximally entangled states between two sites. Furthermore, we illustrate that our SN system can be used as a sensor device able to determine an unknown phase applied to a system spin. A detailed modelling investigation of the effects of static disorder in the system shows that our system is robust against different types of disorder. ",

    "abstract": "Feynman path integrals provide an elegant, classically-inspired representation for the quantum propagator and the quantum dynamics, through summing over a huge manifold of all possible paths. From computational and simulational perspectives, the ergodic tracking of the whole path manifold is a hard problem. Machine learning can help, in an efficient manner, to identify the relevant subspace and the intrinsic structure residing at a small fraction of the vast path manifold. In this work, we propose the concept of Feynman path generator, which efficiently generates Feynman paths with fixed endpoints from a (low-dimensional) latent space, by targeting a desired density of paths in the Euclidean space-time. With such path generators, the Euclidean propagator as well as the ground state wave function can be estimated efficiently for a generic potential energy. Our work leads to a fresh approach for calculating the quantum propagator, paves the way toward generative modelling of Feynman paths, and may also provide a future new perspective to understand the quantum-classical correspondence through deep learning.

Solid state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. In this review, we consider how nanomaterials (i.e. materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. We identify the materials challenges for specific types of qubits, and we identify how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges. Challenges for and progress towards nanomaterials based quantum devices are identified. We aim to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

    "abstract": "The biological skin enables animals to sense various stimuli. Extensive efforts have been made recently to develop smart skin-like sensors to extend the capabilities of biological skins; however, simultaneous sensing of several types of stimuli in a large area remains challenging because this requires large-scale sensor integration with numerous wire connections. We propose a simple, highly sensitive, and multimodal sensing approach, which does not require integrating multiple sensors. The proposed approach is based on an optical interference technique, which can encode the information of various stimuli as a spatial pattern. In contrast to the existing approach, the proposed approach, combined with a deep neural network, enables us to freely select the sensing mode according to our purpose. As a key example, we demonstrate simultaneous sensing mode of three different physical quantities, contact force, contact location, and temperature, using a single soft material without requiring complex integration. Another unique property of the proposed approach is spatially continuous sensing with ultrahigh resolution of few tens of micrometers, which enables identifying the shape of the object in contact. Furthermore, we present a haptic soft device for a human-machine interface. The proposed approach encourages the development of high-performance optical skins. ",

    "abstract": "The influence of measurement back action on electro-optic sampling of electromagnetic quantum fluctuations is investigated. Based on a cascaded treatment of the nonlinear interaction between a near-infrared coherent probe and the mid-infrared vacuum, we account for the generated electric-field contributions that lead to detectable back action. Specifically, we theoretically address two realistic setups, exploiting one or two probe beams for the nonlinear interaction with the quantum vacuum, respectively. The setup parameters at which back action starts to considerably contaminate the measured noise profiles are determined. Due to the vacuum fluctuations entering at the beam splitter, the shot noise of two incoming probe pulses in different channels is uncorrelated. This leads to the absence of the base-level shot noise in the correlation, while further contributions due to nonlinear shot-noise enhancement are still present. Ultimately, the regime in which electro-optic sampling of quantum fields can be considered as effectively back-action free is found. ",
