    "abstract": "Spectral purity of any millimeter wave (mmW) source is of the utmost interest in low-noise applications. Optical synthesis via photomixing is an attractive source for such mmWs, which usually involves expensive spectrally pure lasers with narrow linewidths approaching monochromaticity due to their inherent fabrication costs or specifications. Here, we report an alternative option for enhancing the spectral purity of inexpensive semiconductor diode lasers via a self-injection locking technique through corresponding Stokes waves from a fiber Brillouin cavity exhibiting greatly improved phase noise levels and large wavelength tunability of ~1.8 nm. We implement a system with two self-injected diode lasers on a common Brillouin cavity aimed at difference frequency generation in the mmW and THz region. We generate tunable sub-mmW (0.3 and 0.5 THz) waves by beating the self-injected two wavelength Stokes light on a uni-travelling carrier photodiode and characterize the noise performance. The sub-mmW features miniscule timing noise levels in the zepto-second (zs.Hz^-0.5) scale outperforming the state of the art dissipative Kerr soliton based micro-resonator setups while offering broader frequency tunability. These results suggest a viable inexpensive alternative for mmW sources aimed at low-noise applications featuring lab-scale footprints and rack-mounted portability while paving the way for chip-scale photonic integration.

    "abstract": "A micro-ring-resonator (MRR) optical biosensor based on the evanescent field sensing mechanism has been extensively studied due to its high sensitivity and compact device size. However, a suitable on-chip integrated spectrometer device has to be demonstrated for the lab-on-a-chip applications, which can read the resonance wavelength shift from MRR biosensors based on minuscule changes in refractive index. In this paper, we demonstrated the design and experimental results of the near-infrared lab-on-a-chip optical biosensor platform that monolithically integrates the MRR and the on-chip spectrometer on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer, which can eliminate the external optical spectrum analyzer for scanning the wavelength spectrum. The symmetric add-drop MRR biosensor is designed to have a free spectral range (FSR) of ~19 nm, and a bulk sensitivity of ~73 nm/RIU; then the drop-port output resonance peaks are reconstructed from the integrated spatial-heterodyne Fourier transform spectrometer (SHFTS) with the spectral resolution of ~3.1 nm and bandwidth of ~50 nm, which results in the limit of detection of 0.042 RIU. The MRR output spectrum with air- and water-claddings are measured and reconstructed from the MRR-SHFTS integrated device experimentally to validate the wavelength shifting measurement. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate ab initio calculations are of fundamental importance in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, which have witnessed rapid development in the last couple of years with the help of machine learning computational techniques such as neural networks. Most of the recent efforts applying neural networks to ab initio calculation have been focusing on the energy of the system. In this study, we take a step forward and look at the interatomic force obtained with neural network wavefunction methods by implementing and testing several commonly used force estimators in variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC). Our results show that neural network ansatz can improve the calculation of interatomic force upon traditional VMC. The relation between the force error and the quality of neural network, the contribution of different force terms, and the computational cost of each term are also discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. Our work paves the way for applying neural network wavefunction methods in simulating structures/dynamics of molecules/materials and providing training data for developing accurate force fields. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Patient-specific ridge filters can modulate proton energy to obtain a conformal dose. We describe a new framework for optimization of filter design and spot maps to meet the unique demands of FLASH radiotherapy. We demonstrate an Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT) approach for optimization of dose, dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), and dose-averaged LET (LETd). Methods: We developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters that spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal beam-specific planning target volume. The software optimizes patient-specific ridge filter and uses a Monte Carlo calculation engine, based on Geant4, to provide dose and LET influence matrices. Plan optimization, using matRAD, accommodates the IBO-IMPT objective function considering dose, dose rate, and LET simultaneously with minimum MU constraints. The framework enables design of both regularly spaced and sparse-optimized ridge filters, which allow faster delivery and selective LET optimization. Volume distributions and histograms for dose, DADR, and LETd are compared using evaluation structures specific to the heart and lung. Results: We used IBO-IMPT to design ridge filters for a central lung tumor patient. The IBO-IMPT framework selectively spared heart and lung by reducing LET and increasing dose rate, relative to IMPT planning. Sparse-optimized ridge filters were superior to regularly spaced ridge filters in dose rate. Together, these innovations substantially increased the DADR in the heart and lung while maintaining good target coverage. The volume that received a FLASH dose rate of higher 40 Gy/second increased by 31% for heart and 50% for lung. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using an IBO-IMPT framework to accomplish proton FLASH SBPT, accounting for dose, DADR, and LETd simultaneously. ",

By enabling a cycling transition that is simultaneously spin-selective and spin-preserving, a quantum non-demolition measurement with a spin-detection efficiency of 50$\\%$ is realized.

Quantum coherence and bosonic enhancement are two unique features of many-body reactions involving bosonic reactants and products. Such collective reactions of chemicals, dubbed \"super-chemistry\", is an elusive goal in quantum chemistry research. Here we report the observation of coherent and collective reactive coupling between Bose condensed atoms and molecules near a Feshbach resonance. Starting from an atomic condensate, the reaction begins with a rapid formation of molecules, followed by oscillations of their populations in the equilibration process. Faster oscillations are observed in samples with higher densities, indicating bosonic enhancement. We present a quantum field model which describes the dynamics well and identifies three-body recombination as the dominant reaction process. Our findings exemplify the highly sought-after quantum many-body chemistry and offer a new paradigm for the control of quantum chemical reactions. ",

The thermalization to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution is driven by the nonlinearity. On the other hand, the structural disorder is responsible for a relaxation toward the homogeneous equilibrium distribution (particle equipartition), which thus inhibits thermalization (energy equipartition). On the basis of the wave turbulence theory, we derive a kinetic equation that accounts for the presence of strong disorder. The theory unveils the interplay of disorder and nonlinearity. It unexpectedly reveals that a non-equilibrium process of condensation and thermalization can take place in the regime where disorder effects dominate over nonlinear effects. We validate the theory by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and the derived kinetic equation, which are found in quantitative agreement without using adjustable parameters. Experiments realized in multimode optical fibers with an applied external stress evidence the process of thermalization in the presence of strong disorder. ",

Here we propose a new setup where we can generate, inject and accelerate them in a single stage during the propagation of an intense laser in a plasma channel. The positrons are created from a laser-electron collision at 90 degrees, where the injection and guiding are made possible by an 800 nC electron beam loading which reverses the sign of the background electrostatic field.

These quantum noises are ubiquitous in quantum devices and generate adverse effects in the quantum computational model, leading to extensive research on their correction and mitigation techniques. But do these quantum noises always provide disadvantages? We tackle this issue by proposing a framework called quantum noise-induced reservoir computing and show that some abstract quantum noise models can induce useful information processing capabilities for temporal input data. We demonstrate this ability in several typical benchmarks and investigate the information processing capacity to clarify the framework's processing mechanism and memory profile. We verified our perspective by implementing the framework in a number of IBM quantum processors and obtained similar characteristic memory profiles with model analyses. As a surprising result, information processing capacity increased with quantum devices' higher noise levels and error rates. Our study opens up a novel path for diverting useful information from quantum computer noises into a more sophisticated information processor. ",

Density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate geometry optimization, electronic and adsorption mechanism of haeck-BNQD using Gaussian16 package, employing the hybrid B3LYP and wB97XD functionals, along with 6- 31G(d,p) basis set. A number of physical quantities such as HOMO/LUMO energies, the density of states, hydrogen atom adsorption energies, Mulliken populations, Gibbs free energy, work functions, overpotentials, etc., have been computed and analyzed in the context of the catalytic performance of haeck-BNQD for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER).
