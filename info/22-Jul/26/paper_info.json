At this power level, the bulk laser generates pulses with a duration of 369 fs at 84.4-MHz repetition rate, corresponding to a pulse energy of 103 nJ and a peak power of 246 kW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest average power and pulse energy directly generated from a mode-locked bulk laser in the 2-3 um wavelength region. Our current results indicate that Ho:CALGO is a competitive candidate for average power scaling of 2 um femtosecond lasers. ",

    "abstract": "Highly compact lasers with ultra-low threshold and single-mode continuous wave (CW) operation have been a long sought-after component for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs), due to their excellent ability of trapping light and enhancing light-matter interaction, have been investigated in lasing configurations combining various BIC cavities and optical gain materials. However, the realization of BIC laser with a highly compact size and an ultra-low CW threshold has remained elusive. We demonstrate room temperature CW BIC lasers in the 1310 nm O-band wavelength range, by fabricating a miniaturized BIC cavity in an InAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot (QD) gain membrane. By enabling effective trapping of both light and carriers in all three dimensions, single-mode lasing is realized in cavities as small as only 5*5 unit-cells (~2.5*2.5 {\\mu}m2 cavity size) with a mode volume of 1.16({\\lambda}/n)3, exhibiting an ultra-low threshold of 17 {\\mu}W (74 W/cm2). With its advantages in terms of a small footprint, ultralow power consumption, robustness of fabrication and adaptness for integration, the mini-BIC lasers offer a perspective light source for future PICs aimed at high-capacity optical communications, sensing and quantum information.

If the images in each frame are replaced by terahertz (THz) waves, such movies can monitor low-energy resonances and reveal fast structural or chemical transitions. Here, we combine THz spectroscopy as a non-invasive optical probe with a real-time monitoring technique to resolve non-reproducible phenomena at 50k frames per second. The concept, based on dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy to achieve unprecedented acquisition speed of THz spectroscopy data, is demonstrated by monitoring sub-millisecond dynamics of hot carriers injected in silicon by successive resonant pulses as a saturation density is established. We anticipate that our experimental configuration will play a crucial role in revealing fast irreversible physical and chemical processes at THz frequencies with microsecond resolution to enable new applications in fundamental research as well as in industry, notably as a rapid supply chain monitoring system in high-volume manufacturing.

Not only the topological phase transition and the non-trivial CSs with fractional charge induced by multipole moments, but also a new type of CSs are found due to the complex structure of TM-PQCs near corners. The different origins of these CSs are also analyzed based on the tight-binding model.

For infrared light, photonic integrated circuit 16 (PIC) beam-scanners are often optical phased arrays (OPAs) that steer a light beam using wavelength tuning and/or phase shifters. For visible light, OPAs are significantly more challenging due to the lack of wideband tunable laser sources, lower efficiency phase shifters, and need for smaller feature sizes. Here, we demonstrate side-lobe-free, wideband visible spectrum ({\\lambda} = 410-700 nm) beam steering by electro-thermally actuated micro-cantilevers with embedded silicon nitride waveguides and grating couplers. The devices achieved a scan range of 30.6{\\deg} with only 31 mW of electrical power for one-dimensional scanning and a 12{\\deg}x24{\\deg} field of view with 46 mW of electrical power for two-dimensional scanning. The devices were monolithically integrated in an active visible light photonic platform on 200-mm silicon wafers. Due to their scalability, ultra-compactness, and wavelength-independent scan range, these beam-scanners offer a unique approach for efficient chip-scale light projection. ",

We employ quantum stochastic walks (QSW) with the hope of bettering the classical PageRank (CPR) algorithm, which is based on classical continuous time random walks (CTRW). We implement QSW via two schemes: only incoherence and dephasing with incoherence. PageRank using QSW with only incoherence or QSW with dephasing and incoherence best resolves degeneracies that are unresolvable via CPR and with a convergence time comparable to that for CPR, which is generally the minimum. For some networks, the two QSW schemes obtain a convergence time lower than CPR and an almost degeneracy-free ranking compared to CPR. ",

After more than four years in orbit, the LRI does well in challenging the conventional Microwave Instrument (MWI). However, in the current data processing scheme, the LRI product still needs the MWI data to co-estimate the unknown absolute laser frequency, representing the \"ruler\" for converting the raw phase measurements into a physical displacement in meters. In this paper, we derive formulas for precisely converting the phase measurement into a range, giving rise to a varying carrier frequency. Furthermore, the dominant errors due to knowledge uncertainty of the carrier frequency as well as uncorrected time biases are derived. In the second part, we address the dependency of the LRI on the MWI in the currently employed cross-calibration scheme and present three different models for the LRI laser frequency, two of which are largely independent of the MWI. Furthermore, we analyze the contribution of thermal variations on the scale factor estimates and the LRI-MWI residuals. A linear model called Thermal Correction (TC) is derived that significantly reduces the differences between LRI and MWI to a level where the MWI observations limit the comparison. ",
