The ambient plasma is not contaminated by the plasma produced in the early time after the laser shot. While the observed developing shock does not have stationary downstream structure, it possesses some characteristics of a magnetized supercritical shock, which are supported by a one-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation taking the effect of finite time of laser-target interaction into account.

    "abstract": "Inverse cascades of kinetic energy and thermal variance in the subset of vertically homogeneous modes in spectral space are found to cause a slow aggregation to a pair of convective supergranules that eventually fill the whole horizontally extended, three-dimensional, turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection layer when a heat flux is prescribed at the top and bottom. An additional weak rotation of the layer around the vertical axis stops this aggregation at a scale that is smaller than the lateral domain extension and ceases the inverse cascade. The resulting characteristic length of the aggregated convection patterns depends on the thermal driving and linearly on the strength of rotation. Our study demonstrates the importance of inverse energy cascades beyond the two-dimensional turbulence case, in a three-dimensional convection flow that is subject to a multi-scale energy injection by thermal plumes and driven by boundary heat fluxes as typically present in natural geo- and astrophysical systems.

    "abstract": "Widefield quantum microscopy based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond has emerged as a powerful technique for quantitative mapping of magnetic fields with a sub-micron resolution. However, the accuracy of the technique has not been characterised in detail so far. Here we show that optical aberrations in the imaging system may cause large systematic errors in the measured quantity beyond trivial blurring. We introduce a simple theoretical framework to model these effects, which extends the concept of a point spread function to the domain of spectral imaging. Using this model, the magnetic field imaging of test magnetic samples is simulated under various scenarios, and the resulting errors quantified. We then apply the model to previously published data, show that apparent magnetic anomalies can be explained by the presence of optical aberrations, and demonstrate a post-processing technique to retrieve the source quantity with improved accuracy. This work presents a guide to predict and mitigate aberration induced artefacts in quantitative NV-based widefield imaging and in spectral imaging more generally. ",

We study the impact of the pulses length as well as of the interrogation time onto the contrast of the atom interferometer. Our experimental data are well reproduced by a numerical simulation based on an effective coupling which depends on the overlap between the pulses and the atomic cloud. These results pave the way for extending light-pulse interferometry to transitions in other spectral regions and therefore to other species, for new possibilities in metrology, sensing of gravito-inertial effects and tests of fundamental physics.

    "abstract": "Optical control of electronic properties is essential for future electric devices. Manipulating such properties has been limited to the microscale in spatial volume due to the wave nature of light; however, scaling down the volume is in extremely high demand. In this study, we demonstrate optical switching within a nanometric spatial volume in an organic electric material. Photochromic materials such as diarylethene derivatives exhibit semiconducting and insulating properties on ultraviolet (UV) and visible light, respectively, which are promising for optical switching and memory. To control the wavelength between visible and UV light at the nanoscale, we employed plasmon nanofocusing, which allows the creation of a nanolight source at the apex of a metallic tapered structure over a broad frequency range by focusing of propagating plasmons. We utilized an aluminum tapered structure and realized in-situ wavelength control between visible and UV light at the nanoscale. Using this method, nanoscale optical switching between the two states of diarylethene was demonstrated. The switching performance was confirmed for at least nine cycles without degradation. This demonstration would make a significant step forward toward next-generation nanoscale optoelectronic devices and stimulate diverse scientific fields owing to the unique concept of broadband plasmon nanofocusing.

    "abstract": "We develop a new type of model for solving the task of inverting the transmission effects of multi-mode optical fibres through the construction of an $\\mathrm{SO}^{+}(2,1)$-equivariant neural network. This model takes advantage of the of the azimuthal correlations known to exist in fibre speckle patterns and naturally accounts for the difference in spatial arrangement between input and speckle patterns. In addition, we use a second post-processing network to remove circular artifacts, fill gaps, and sharpen the images, which is required due to the nature of optical fibre transmission. This two stage approach allows for the inspection of the predicted images produced by the more robust physically motivated equivariant model, which could be useful in a safety-critical application, or by the output of both models, which produces high quality images. Further, this model can scale to previously unachievable resolutions of imaging with multi-mode optical fibres and is demonstrated on $256 \\times 256$ pixel images. This is a result of improving the trainable parameter requirement from $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $N$ is pixel size and $m$ is number of fibre modes. Finally, this model generalises to new images, outside of the set of training data classes, better than previous models. ",

A binary temporal phase modulation of CW laser field propagating through a group-delay-dispersion circuit of the fractional Talbot length $P/Q$ results in a well defined sequence of square-wave-form pulses. When $P=1$ a duty ratio of the pulses $D$ is $1/2$ for $Q=4$ and $1/3$ for $Q=3$ and 6. Maximum intensity of the pulses doubles and triples compared to the CW intensity for $D=1/2$ and $1/3$, respectively. These pulses can be used for return-to-zero laser field modulation in optical fiber communication. For $D=1/3$ extra features between the pulses are found originating from a finite rise and drop time of phase in a binary phase modulation. Similar effect as a benefit of the time-space analogy is predicted for binary phase gratings and interpreted as gleams produced by imperfect edges of the components of the rectangular phase gratings.

Second, the creation, characterization and control of color centers in nanodiamonds. Third, the assembly of hybrid quantum photonics by integrating the nanodiamonds into the photonic structures. One focus will be the efficient interfacing of the color centers done by optimizing the optical coupling. The chapter describes recent progress in all three steps and summarizes the established hybrid platform.

However, only recently has it been realized theoretically that in the presence of gauge symmetry, the algebraic structure of symmetries can be projectively represented, which possibly enables the switch between spinless and spinful topological phases. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of this idea by realizing spinful topological phases in \"spinless\" acoustic crystals with projective space-time inversion symmetry. In particular, we realize a DIII-class one-dimensional topologically gapped phase characterized by a 2Z winding number, which features Kramers degenerate bands and Kramers pair of topological boundary modes. Our work thus overcomes a fundamental constraint on topological phases by spin classes. ",
