    "abstract": "We derive analytical solutions, based on singular Green's functions, either for finite or infinite arrays of elastic beams - with circular cross section - atop an elastic plate. Our methodology is versatile and allows us to efficiently solve a range of problems regarding arrangements of multiple beams per primitive cell, over Bragg to deep-subwavelength scales; we cross-verify against finite element numerical simulations to gain further confidence in our approach which relies upon the hypothesis of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory considerably simplifying continuity conditions, such that each beam can be replaced by point forces and moments applied to the neutral plane of the plate. The representations of Green's functions by Fourier series or Fourier transforms readily follows, yielding efficient and accurate analytical schemes. The accuracy and flexibility of our solutions are demonstrated by engineering topologically non-trivial states, from primitive cells with broken spatial symmetries, following the phononic analogue of the Quantum Valley Hall effect. Topologically protected states are produced and coexist along: interfaces between adjoining chiral-mirrored bulk media and edges between one such chiral bulk and the bare elastic plate, allowing topological circuits to be designed with robust waveguiding; these topologically non-trivial states exist within near flexural resonances of the constituent beams of the phononic crystal, and hence can be tuned into a deep-subwavelength regime.

    "abstract": "We apply the superiorization methodology to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning problem. In superiorization, linear voxel dose inequality constraints are the fundamental modeling tool within which a feasibility-seeking projection algorithm will seek a feasible point. This algorithm is then perturbed with gradient descent steps to reduce a nonlinear objective function. Within the open-source inverse planning toolkit matRad, we implement a prototypical algorithmic framework for superiorization using the well-established Agmon, Motzkin, and Schoenberg (AMS) feasibility-seeking projection algorithm and common nonlinear dose optimization objective functions. Based on this prototype, we apply superiorization to intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning and compare its performance with feasibility-seeking and nonlinear constrained optimization. For these comparisons, we use the TG119 water phantom and a head-and-neck patient of the CORT dataset. Bare feasibility-seeking with AMS confirms previous studies, showing it can find solutions that are nearly equivalent to those found by the established piece-wise least-squares optimization approach. The superiorization prototype solved the linearly constrained planning problem with similar performance to that of a general-purpose nonlinear constrained optimizer while showing smooth convergence in both constraint proximity and objective function reduction. Superiorization is a useful alternative to constrained optimization in radiotherapy inverse treatment planning. Future extensions with other approaches to feasibility-seeking, e.g., with dose-volume constraints and more sophisticated perturbations, may unlock its full potential for high-performant inverse treatment planning.

Here, we exploit the fast focusing capability of the Cake-Cutting Hadamard coding algorithm to counteract the effects of perturbations and improve the system's robustness.

However, the spatio-temporal coherence of the light source has been essential for generating OAM beams, as incoherent ambient light would result in polychromatic and obscured OAM beams in the visible spectrum. Here, we extend the applications of OAM to ambient lighting conditions. By miniaturizing spiral phase plates and integrating them with structural color filters, we achieve spatio-temporal coherence using only an incoherent white light source. These optical elements act as building blocks that encode both color and OAM information in the form of colorful optical vortices. Thus, pairs of transparent substrates that contain matching positions of these vortices constitute a reciprocal optical lock and key system. Due to the multiple helical eigenstates of OAM, the pairwise coupling can be further extended to form a one-to-many matching and validation scheme. Generating and decoding colorful optical vortices with broadband white light could find potential applications in anti-counterfeiting, optical metrology, high-capacity optical encryption, and on-chip 3D photonic devices.

    "abstract": "Colloidal nanoplatelets (NPLs) are promising materials for lasing applications. The properties are usually discussed in the framework of 2D materials, where strong excitonic effects dominate the optical properties near the band edge. At the same time, NPLs have finite lateral dimensions such that NPLs are not true extended 2D structures. Here we study the photophysics and gain properties of CdSe/CdS/ZnS core-shell-shell NPLs upon electrochemical n doping and optical excitation. Steady-state absorption and PL spectroscopy show that excitonic effects are weaker in core-shell-shell nanoplatelets due to the reduced exciton binding energy. Transient absorption studies reveal a gain threshold of only one excitation per nanoplatelet. Using electrochemical n doping we observe the complete bleaching of the band edge exciton transitions. Combining electrochemical doping with transient absorption spectroscopy we demonstrate that the gain threshold is fully removed over a broad spectral range and gain coefficients of several thousand cm-1 are obtained. These doped NPLs are the best performing colloidal nanomaterial gain medium reported to date. The low exciton binding energy due to the CdS and ZnS shells, in combination with the relatively small lateral size of the NPLs, result in excited states that are effectively delocalised over the entire platelet. Core-shell NPLs are thus on the border between strong confinement in QDs and dominant Coulombic effects in 2D materials. We demonstrate that this limit is in effect ideal for optical gain, and that it results in an optimal lateral size of the platelets where the gain threshold per nm2 is minimal. ",

The optical properties of the photonic microcavities have been simulated by means of the transfer matrix method, considering the wavelength dependent refractive indexes of all the materials involved.

Although resonant beam-based SLIPT (RB-SLIPT) can realize high-power energy transfer, high-rate data transfer, human safety, and self-alignment simultaneously, mobile transmission channel (MTC) analysis under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation has not been investigated. In this paper, we propose analytical models and simulation tools for reflector-assisted NLOS transmission of RB-SLIPT, where transmission loss and accurate beam field profile of NLOS MTC can be obtained with a receiver at arbitrary positions and attitude angles. We establish analytical models relying on full diffraction theory for beam propagation between tilted or off-axis planes. Then, we provide three numerical methods (i.e., NUFFT-based, cubic interpolation-based, and linear interpolation-based methods) in simulations. Moreover, to deal with the contradiction between limited computing memory and high sampling requirements for long-range transmission analysis, we propose a multi-hop sliding window approach, which can reduce the sampling number by a factor of thousands. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that RB-SLIPT can achieve $4$W charging power and $12$bit/s/Hz data rate over $2$m distance in NLOS scenarios. ",

The scaling laws for the harmonic yield and harmonic cutoff energy with pulse duration and fundamental driver wavelengths are also deduced. Furthermore, a detailed wavelet analysis of harmonic generation by sub-cycle pulses is carried out.

    "abstract": "Continuous wave optical parametric oscillation (OPO) provides a flexible approach for accessing mid-infrared wavelengths between 2 $\\mu$m to 5 $\\mu$m, but has not yet been integrated into silicon nanophotonics. Typically, Kerr OPO uses a single transverse mode family for pump, signal, and idler modes, and relies on a delicate balance to achieve normal (but close-to-zero) dispersion near the pump and the requisite higher-order dispersion needed for phase- and frequency-matching. Within integrated photonics platforms, this approach results in two major problems. First, the dispersion is very sensitive to geometry, so that small fabrication errors can have a large impact. Second, the device is susceptible to competing nonlinear processes near the pump. In this letter, we propose a flexible solution to infrared OPO that addresses these two problems, by using a silicon nitride photonic crystal microring (PhCR). The frequency shifts created by the PhCR bandgap enable OPO that would otherwise be forbidden. We report an intrinsic optical quality factor up to (1.2 $\\pm$ 0.1)$\\times$10$^6$ in the 2 $\\mu$m band, and use a PhCR ring to demonstrate an OPO with threshold power of (90 $\\pm$ 20) mW dropped into the cavity, with the pump wavelength at 1998~nm, and the signal and idler wavelengths at 1937 nm and 2063 nm, respectively. We further discuss how to extend OPO spectral coverage in the mid-infrared. These results establish the PhCR OPO as a promising route for integrated laser sources in the infrared. ",

CMB-S4 will observe from two sites, the South Pole and the Atacama Desert of Chile. A combination of small- and large-aperture telescopes with hundreds of thousands of polarization-sensitive detectors will observe in several frequency bands from 20-300 GHz, surveying more than 50 percent of the sky to arcminute resolution with unprecedented sensitivity. CMB-S4 seeks to make a dramatic leap in sensitivity while observing across a broad range of largely unprotected spectrum which is increasingly being utilized for terrestrial and satellite transmissions. Fundamental aspects of CMB instrument technology leave them vulnerable to radio frequency interference (RFI) across a wide range of frequencies, including frequencies outside of their observing bands. Ground-based CMB instruments achieve their extraordinary sensitivities by deploying large focal planes of superconducting bolometers to extremely dry, high-altitude sites, with large fractional bandwidths, wide fields of view, and years of integration time. Suitable observing sites have historically offered significant protection from RFI, both naturally through their extremely remote locations as well as through restrictions on local emissions. Since the coupling mechanisms are complex, safe levels or frequencies of emission that would not interfere with CMB measurements cannot always be determined through straightforward calculations. We discuss models of interference for various types of RFI relevant to CMB-S4, mitigation strategies, and the potential impacts on survey sensitivity. ",

In this work, we present a general quantum-computing approach to quantum phase transitions that exploits the geometric structure of reduced density matrices. While typical approaches to quantum phase transitions examine discontinuities in the order parameters, the origin of phase transitions -- their order parameters and symmetry breaking -- can be understood geometrically in terms of the set of two-particle reduced density matrices (2-RDMs). The convex set of 2-RDMs provides a comprehensive map of the quantum system including its distinct phases as well as the transitions connecting these phases. Because 2-RDMs can potentially be computed on quantum computers at non-exponential cost, even when the quantum system is strongly correlated, they are ideally suited for a quantum-computing approach to quantum phase transitions. We compute the convex set of 2-RDMs for a Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model on IBM superconducting-qubit quantum processors. Even though computations are limited to few-particle models due to device noise, comparisons with a classically solvable 1000-particle model reveal that the finite-particle quantum solutions capture the key features of the phase transitions including the strong correlation and the symmetry breaking.

Disorder and defects in the surface layer typically cause degradation of charge carrier transport and radiative recombination dynamics. However, surface vicinity is inevitable for many scalable nano-optical applications. Epitaxially grown quantum dots are the best candidate for high-performance single photon emission and show great potential for quantum technologies. Yet, these emitters only reveal their excellent properties if they are deeply embedded in a semiconductor host. Until today, quantum dots close to surfaces yield weak, broad, and unstable emissions. Here, we show the complete restoration of optical properties from quantum dots grown directly on a semiconductor surface. The vanishing luminescence from the as-grown sample turns into bright, ultra-stable, coherent and blinking-free single photon emission after sulphur passivation. Under quasi-resonant excitation, single photons are generated with 98.8% purity, 77% indistinguishability, linewidths down to 4 $\\mu$eV and 99.69% persistency across 11 orders of magnitude in time. The emission is stable even after two years and when being subjected to nanomanufacturing processes.

    "abstract": "Future quantum networks will require the ability to produce matter-photon entanglement at photon frequencies not naturally emitted from the matter qubit. This allows for a hybrid network architecture, where these photons can couple to other tools and quantum technologies useful for tasks such as multiplexing, routing, and storage, but which operate at wavelengths different from that of the matter qubit source, while also reducing network losses. Here, we demonstrate entanglement between a trapped ion and a 780 nm photon, a wavelength which can interact with neutral-Rb-based quantum networking devices. A single barium ion is used to produce 493 nm photons, entangled with the ion, which are then frequency converted to 780 nm while preserving the entanglement. We generate ion-photon entanglement with fidelities $\\geq$ 0.93(2) and $\\geq$ 0.84(2) for 493 nm and 780 nm photons respectively with the fidelity drop arising predominantly from a reduction in the signal-noise of our detectors at 780 nm compared with at 493 nm.
