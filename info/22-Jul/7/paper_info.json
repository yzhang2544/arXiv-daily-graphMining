    "abstract": "Dissipative Kerr solitons are optical pulses propagating in a nonlinear dielectric waveguide without dispersing. These attractive properties have spurred much research into integrated soliton generation in microring resonators at telecom wavelenghts. However, these solitons are generated via external pumping of a nonlinear medium, which limits system compactness and the wavelength coverage. Recently it was shown that dissipative Kerr solitons can be generated directly in the gain medium of mid-infrared semiconductor ring lasers, where the energy is supplied via electrical pumping. These technological advances enable a new route towards the monolithic generation of diverse light states in a wide frequency range, requiring insight into the conditions necessary for achieving control over the system. In this work, we study in depth the phase diagram of such systems, exhibiting fast gain dynamics and no external pumping, and which are described by the complex cubic Ginzburg-Landau equation with periodic boundary conditions. While previous studies have focused on large system sizes, we here focus on finite ring sizes leading to a modification of the phase space and enlargement of the region for stable soliton formation. In addition to localized, dispersion-less soliton pulses on a finite background, breather solitons are predicted to occur under feasible experimental conditions. This enables monolithic generation of solitions in electrically pumped media such as quantum cascade lasers, extending the availability of soliton sources to mid-infrared and terahertz frequencies which are very attractive for molecular spectroscopy, free-space communication, imaging, and coating thickness measurements.

In this context, here we widen the framework of hollow-core fiber-based beam delivery applications by demonstrating their utilization as promising platforms for Power-over-Fiber systems. Thus, we report on the use of a tubular-lattice hollow-core fiber to deliver a watt-level continuous-wave laser beam onto a photovoltaic converter and activate a representative camera circuit.

The second is SERRS envelopes exhibiting higher energy shifts from the plasmon resonance spectra. These results are examined as an effect of degree of morphological asymmetry in dimers based on an electromagnetic (EM) mechanism. The analysis of the first and second types reveals that dipole-dipole and dipole-quadrupole coupled plasmon resonance (subradiant Fano resonance) respectively determine the EM enhancement. This mechanism is commonly important for the development of plasmonic nanostructures for various surface enhanced spectroscopies. ",

Recent advances in the fabrication and application of thin-film lithium niobate, and its integration with photonic integrated circuits based in silicon make it an ideal platform for such a device. In this work, a high-extinction dual-output folded electro-optic Mach Zehnder modulator in the silicon nitride and thin-film lithium niobate material system is presented. This modulator has an interaction region length of 11 mm and a physical length of 7.8 mm. The device demonstrates a fiber-to-fiber loss of roughly 12 dB using on-chip fiber couplers and DC half wave voltage (V$\\pi$) of less than 3.0 V, or a modulation efficiency (V$\\pi\\cdot$L) of 3.3 V$\\cdot$cm. The device shows a 3 dB bandwidth of roughly 30 GHz. Notably, the device demonstrates a power extinction ratio over 45 dB at each output port without the use of cascaded directional couplers or additional control circuitry; roughly 31 times better than previously reported devices. Paired with a balanced photo-diode receiver, this modulator can be used in various photonic communication systems. Such a detecting scheme is compatible with complex modulation formats such as differential phase shift keying and differential quadrature phase shift keying, where a dual-output, ultra-high extinction device is fundamentally paramount to low-noise operation of the system.

    "abstract": "The impact of solid and liquid objects (projectiles) onto liquids and soft solids (targets) generally results on the creation and expansion of an air cavity inside the impacted objects. The dynamics of cavity expansion and collapse depends on the projectile inertia as well as on the target properties. In this paper we study the impact of microfluidic jets generated by thermocavitation processes on a capillary bridge between two parallel planar walls. Different capillary bridge types were studied, Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic liquids and agarose gels. Thus, we compare the cavity formation and collapse between a wide range of material properties. Moreover, we model the critical impact velocity for a jet to traverse a capillary bridge type. Our results show that agarose gels with a storage modulus lower that 176 Pa can be modelled as a liquid for this transition. However, the predicted transition deviates for agarose gels with higher storage modulus. Additionally, we show different types of cavity collapse, depending on the Weber number and the capillary bridge properties. We conclude that the type of collapse determines the number and size of entrained bubbles. Furthermore, we study the effects of wettability on the adhesion forces and contact line dissipation. We conclude that upon cavity collapse, for hydrophobic walls a Worthington jet is energetically favourable. In contrast, for hydrophilic walls, the contact line dissipation is in the same order of magnitude of the energy of the impacted jet, suppressing the Worthington jet formation. Our results provide strategies for preventing bubble entrapment and give an estimation of the cavity dynamics for needle-free injection applications and additive manufacturing among other applications.

Despite being essential, thickness characterization lags in throughput. Although optical spectroscopic methods, e.g., spectrophotometry, provide quick measurements, a critical bottleneck is the ensuing manual fitting of optical oscillation models to the measured reflection and transmission. This study presents a machine-learning (ML) framework called thicknessML, which rapidly extracts film thickness from spectroscopic reflection and transmission. thicknessML leverages transfer learning to generalize to materials of different underlying optical oscillator models (i.e., different material classes).We demonstrate that thicknessML can extract film thickness from six perovskite samples in a two-stage process: (1) pre-training on a generic simulated dataset of Tauc-Lorentz oscillator, and (2) transfer learning to a simulated perovskite dataset of several literature perovskite refractive indices. Results show a pre-training thickness mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5-7% and an experimental thickness MAPE of 6-19%. ",

Indeed, such systems support unbalanced unidirectional flows that can lead to the localization of an extensive number of states at the boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Recently, a generalized (rank-2) chirality describing a 2D robust gapless mode with dispersion $\\omega=k_{x}k_{y}$ has been introduced in crystalline systems. Here we demonstrate that rank-2 chirality imbalances can be established in a non-Hermitian (NH) lattice system leading to momentum-resolved chiral dynamics, and a rank-2 NHSE where there are both edge- and corner-localized skin modes. We then experimentally test this phenomenology in a 2-dimensional topolectric circuit that implements a NH Hamiltonian with a long-lived rank-2 chiral mode. Using impedance measurements, we confirm the rank-2 NHSE in this system, and its manifestation in the predicted skin modes and a highly unusual momentum-position locking response. Our investigation demonstrates a circuit-based path to exploring higher-rank chiral physics, with potential applications in systems where momentum resolution is necessary, e.g., in beamformers and non-reciprocal devices.

    "abstract": "We present a hidden Markov model analysis for fluorescent time series of quantum dots. A fundamental quantity to measure optical performance of the quantum dots is a distribution function for the light-emission duration. So far, to estimate it, a threshold value for the fluorescent intensity was introduced, and the light-emission state was evaluated as a state above the threshold. With this definition, the light-emission duration was estimated, and its distribution function was derived as a blinking plot. Due to the noise in the fluorescent data, however, this treatment generates a large number of artificially short-lived emission states, thus leading to an erroneous blinking plot. In the present paper, we propose a hidden Markov model to eliminate these artifacts. The hidden Markov model introduces a hidden variable specifying the light-emission and quenching states behind the observed fluorescence. We found that it is possible to avoid the above artifacts by identifying the state from the hidden-variable time series. We found that, from the analysis of experimental and theoretical benchmark data, the accuracy of our hidden Markov model is beyond human cognitive ability. ",

According to the resonance wave interaction approximation used to derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum the dominant interactions are between wave triads whose wavevectors satisfy $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{p}+\\mathbf{q}$, and their frequencies satisfy $\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}=|\\omega_{\\mathbf{p}}-\\omega_{\\mathbf{q}}|$ or $\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}=\\omega_{\\mathbf{p}}+\\omega_{\\mathbf{q}}$. In order to test the validity of the resonance wave interaction approximation, we examine several analytical derivations of the theory. The assumptions underlying each derivation are tested using direct numerical simulations representing near-observed energy levels of the internal wave field. We show that the assumptions underlying the derivations are not consistent with the simulated dynamics. In addition, most of the triads satisfying the resonant conditions do not contribute significantly to nonlinear wave energy transfer, while some interactions that are dominant in nonlinear energy transfers do not satisfy the resonance conditions. We also point to possible self-consistency issues with some derivations found in the literature. ",

    "title": "Tuning Spectral Properties of Individual and Multiple Quantum Emitters  in Noisy Environments",
    "abstract": "A quantum emitter in a dynamic environment may have its energy levels drift uncontrollably in time with the fluctuating bath. This can result in an emission/absorption spectrum that is spread over a broad range of frequencies and presents a challenging hurdle for various applications. We consider a quantum emitter in an environment that alters the energy levels so that the emission frequency is represented by a Gaussian random distribution around a given mean value with given standard deviation and correlation time. We study the emission spectrum of this system when it is placed under the influence of a periodic sequence of finite width $\\pi$ pulses. We show that this external field protocol can effectively overcome spectral diffusion in this system by refocusing the bulk of the emission spectrum onto the pulse carrier frequency. We further consider two such emitters in different noisy environments and find that the two-photon interference operation can be made efficient by the sequence of finite width pulses applied on both systems. Finally, we show that an ensemble of nominally similar emitters, each with its different environment, and thus randomly shifted emission frequency, can have its overall emission spectrum that would otherwise be inhomogeneously broadened according to the random distribution, refocused onto a lineshape with a well-defined central peak that has the linewidth of an individual isolated non-noisy emitter. These results demonstrate for this specific model of noisy environments, the protection of spectral properties by an external control protocol here represented by a periodic sequence of finite width pulses.
