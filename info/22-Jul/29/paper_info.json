    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology is rapidly evolving, and the advancement of data and information processing devices is essential. Silicon THz microresonators provide perfect platforms to develop compact and integrated devices that could transform THz technology. Here we present a systematic study on the key figure of merit of silicon THz disc microresonators - the quality factor (Q-factor) - in dependence on the substrate's resistivity. Our results show that the Q-factor depends linearly on the resistivity and a variation in resistivity from 10k$\\Omega$cm to 15k$\\Omega$cm changes the Q-factor from 50k to 76k at 0.6THz. Moreover, we experimentally determine that the silicon material absorption is inversely proportional to the substrate's resistivity. In general, the presented methodology is ideally suited to precisely measure the material absorption of low-loss materials in the THz domain, which is challenging using conventional THz spectroscopy.

TOBA can detect intermediate-mass black hole binary mergers, gravitational wave stochastic background, and Newtonian noise, and is useful for earthquake early warning. A prototype detector Phase-III TOBA with 35 cm-scale pendulums is under development to demonstrate noise reduction. The target strain sensitivity is set to $1\\times10^{-15}\\,{/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}}$ between 0.1 Hz--10 Hz. A new scheme of wavefront sensing with a coupled cavity was proposed to measure the pendulum rotation as low as $5\\times10^{-16}\\,{{\\rm rad}/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}}$ for Phase-III TOBA. In our method, an auxiliary cavity is used to enhance the first-order Hermite--Gaussian mode in a main cavity. Experimental demonstration is ongoing to confirm the feasibility of angular signal amplification and establish a method for locking a coupled cavity. We evaluated the performance of the coupled cavity and concluded that angular signal amplification would be feasible with this sensor. The coupled cavity was successfully locked to the resonance by the Pound--Drever--Hall technique with two modulation frequencies. ",

    "abstract": "Detailed radiation hydrodynamic simulations are carried out to investigate x-ray emission process in four high-Z planar targets namely, tungsten (W), gold (Au), lead (Pb) and uranium (U) irradiated by 1 ns, 351 nm flat top laser pulses. A thorough zoning analysis is performed for all laser driven high-Z foils over a wide intensity range of $10^{12}-10^{15} W/cm^{2}$ with appropriately chosen photon energy range and recombination parameter. The resulting variation of conversion efficiency over the full intensity range exhibits an optimum for all materials which is explained by considering the characteristic emission contributions from two different regions of laser irradiated plasma, namely, conversion layer and remission zone. A new generalized single scaling relation based upon smooth broken power law is proposed for conversion efficiency variation along with the separate determination ($\\eta_{S}$, $\\eta_{M}$) in soft and hard/M-band x-ray regions. It has been observed that $\\eta_{S}$ for Pb and W always lies in between that for Au and U for intensities smaller than $\\sim 3\\times 10^{13} W/cm^{2}$. On further increase in intensity, $\\eta_{S}$ is observed to be maximum for Au and U whereas it is minimum for W. Significant contribution to M-band conversion efficiencies is observed in all elements for intensities higher than $\\sim 2\\times 10^{13} W/cm^{2}$ with maximum and minimum values attained by W and U, respectively. The results are explained by considering the contributions from the emission coefficients of all materials in both conversion layer and reemission zone up to corresponding photon cut-off energies at different laser intensities.

We introduce a pulse characterisation scheme that maps the magnitude of its short-time Fourier transform. Contrary to many well-known solutions it does not require nonlinear effects and is therefore suitable for single-photon-level measurements. Our method is based on introducing a series of controlled time and frequency shifts, where the latter is performed via an electro-optic modulator allowing a fully-electronic experimental control. We characterized the full spectral and temporal width of a classical and single-photon-level pulse and successfully reconstructed their spectral phase and amplitude. The method can be extended by implementing a phase-sensitive measurement and is naturally well-suited to partially-incoherent light. ",

Here, we analyze classical shadows obtained using random matchgate circuits, which correspond to fermionic Gaussian unitaries. We prove that the first three moments of the Haar distribution over the continuous group of matchgate circuits are equal to those of the discrete uniform distribution over only the matchgate circuits that are also Clifford unitaries; thus, the latter forms a \"matchgate 3-design.\" This implies that the classical shadows resulting from the two ensembles are functionally equivalent. We show how one can use these matchgate shadows to efficiently estimate inner products between an arbitrary quantum state and fermionic Gaussian states, as well as the expectation values of local fermionic operators and various other quantities, thus surpassing the capabilities of prior work. As a concrete application, this enables us to apply wavefunction constraints that control the fermion sign problem in the quantum-classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm (QC-AFQMC) [Nature 603, 416-420], without the exponential post-processing cost incurred by the original approach.

However, here we provide further details and numerics to emphasize that the prospects for practical quantum advantage in QC-QMC remain open. The exponential challenges in QC-QMC are dependent on (1) the choice of QMC methods, (2) the underlying system, and (3) the form of trial and walker wavefunctions. While one can find difficult examples with a specific method, a specific system, and a specific walker/trial form, for some combinations of these choices, the approach is potentially more scalable than other near-term quantum algorithms. Future research should aim to identify examples for which QC-QMC enables practical quantum advantage. ",

Recent progress has shown the potential of QRC exploiting the enlarged Hilbert space, but real-time processing and the achievement of a quantum advantage with efficient use of resources are prominent challenges towards viable experimental realizations. In this work, we propose a photonic platform suitable for real-time QRC based on a physical ensemble of reservoirs in the form of identical optical pulses recirculating through a closed loop. While ideal operation achieves maximum performance, statistical noise is shown to undermine a quantum advantage. We propose a strategy to overcome this limitation and sustain the QRC performance when the size of the system is scaled up. The platform is conceived for experimental implementations to be viable with current technology. ",

We employ first-principles electron-phonon computations within the framework of the DFT+U+J method to reveal the presence of these states within a thermal distribution of phonon displacements and model their evolution with temperature. Our computations reproduce the temperature dependence of the optical dielectric function of hematite with remarkable accuracy and indicate that the band-edge optical absorption and second-order resonance Raman spectra arise from polaronic optical transitions involving coupling to longitudinal optical phonons with energies greater than 50 meV. Additionally, we find that the resulting polaron comprises an electron localized to two adjacent Fe atoms with distortions that lie primarily along the coordinates of phonons with energies of 31 and 81 meV.

    "abstract": "Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal equilibrium presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics. Generically, it is expected that non-integrable quantum systems thermalize as they comply with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)}. A notable exception to this is the phenomenon of many-body localization, where the emergence of local conserved quantities prevents thermalization, which has been observed in finite low-dimensional systems. We study an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable distribution of random coupling strengths realized by a Rydberg quantum simulator. The total magnetization as a function of external field after a quench serves as a probe for thermalization. We find that such an isolated quantum system exhibits a non-thermalizing regime despite being non-integrable. It is shown that thermalization can be restored by reducing the disorder in the coupling strengths. As our system consists of up to 4000 spins, we thus show that closed quantum systems can fail to reach thermal equilibrium even at system sizes approaching the thermodynamic limit. ",
