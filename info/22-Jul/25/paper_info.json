    "abstract": "Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of \"annular\" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.

    "abstract": "We present measurements of ion velocity distribution profiles obtained by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) on an explosive laser produced plasma (LPP). The spatio-temporal evolution of the resulting carbon ion velocity distribution was mapped by scanning through the Doppler-shifted absorption wavelengths using a tunable, diode-pumped laser. The acquisition of this data was facilitated by the high repetition rate capability of the ablation laser (1 Hz) which allowed the accumulation of thousand of laser shots in short experimental times. By varying the intensity of the LIF beam, we were able to explore the effects of fluorescence power against laser irradiance in the context of evaluating the saturation versus the non-saturation regime. The small beam size of the LIF beam led to high spatial resolution of the measurement compared to other ion velocity distribution measurement techniques, while the fast-gated operation mode of the camera detector enabled the measurement of the relevant electron transitions.

Recent proposals of HCI atomic clocks highlight their importance, especially for many-electron HCIs, and they have been theoretically investigated by refining atomic-structure calculations. Nonetheless, no established spectroscopic method is currently available to verify these theoretical calculations. Here, we demonstrate hyperfine-structure-resolved laser spectroscopy of HCIs in an electron beam ion trap plasma, employing the magnetic-dipole transition in 4$d^{9}$5$s$ of $^{127}$I$^{7+}$. Ion-state manipulation by controlled electron collisions in the well-defined laboratory plasma enables laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy of trapped HCIs. The observed spectrum of evaporatively cooled ions under the low magnetic field shows remarkable features reflecting the hyperfine-structures. The present demonstration using the combined optical and plasma approach provides a new benchmark for state-of-the-art atomic calculations of hyperfine-structures in many-electron HCIs and offers possibilities for a variety of unexploited experiments.

We theoretically determine the theoretical thresholds for sub-ambient cooling through yellow, magenta, and cyan CDRCs. We experimentally fabricate and observe a temperature drop of 2.6-8.8 degrees Celsius on average during daytime and 4.0-4.4degrees Celsius during nighttime. Furthermore, we demonstrate a scalable-manufactured magenta CDRC with a width of 60 cm and a length of 500 cm by a roll-to-roll deposition technique. This work provides guidelines for large-scale CDRCs and offers unprecedented opportunities for potential applications with energy-saving, aesthetic, and visual comfort demands. ",

    "abstract": "The ultra-low mass Cylindrical Drift Chamber designed for the MEG experiment upgrade is a challenging apparatus made of 1728 phi = 20 micron gold plated tungsten sense wires, 7680 phi = 40 micron and 2496 phi = 50 micron silver plated aluminum field wires. Because of electrostatic stability requirements all the wires have to be stretched at mechanical tensions of about 25, 19 and 29 g respectively which must be controlled at a level better than 0.5 g. This chamber is presently in acquisition, but during its construction about 100 field wires broke, because of chemical corrosion induced by the atmospheric humidity. On the basis of the experience gained with this chamber we decided to build a new one, equipped with a different type of wires less sensitive to corrosion. The choice of the new wire required a deep inspection of its characteristics and one of the main tools for doing this is a system for measuring the wire tension by means of the resonant frequency technique, which is described in this paper. The system forces the wires to oscillate by applying a sinusoidal signal at a known frequency, and then measures the variation of the capacitance between a wire and a common ground plane as a function of the external signal frequency. We present the details of the measuring system and the results obtained by scanning the mechanical tensions of two samples of MEG II CDCH wires and discuss the possible improvements of the experimental apparatus and of the measuring technique.

    "abstract": "Bidimensional materials are, as their name suggests, ideally viewed as having no thickness. The advent of multilayer stacks of 2D materials and combinations of different materials in vertical van der Waals heterostructures highlights however that these materials have a finite thickness. In this article, we show how volume properties of stacked 2D layers can be calculated from boundary conditions and conversely. We introduce the layer, surrounded by vacuum, as a kind of transfer matrix with intrinsic parameters. This provides a link between continuous and discrete media, and a connection with the interface reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from microscopic models. We show how to model hybrid systems and identify in the zero-thickness limit the intrinsic parameters of the current sheet that represents the 2D material, namely the in-plane surface susceptibility \\(\\chi^s\\) and the out-of-plane parameter \\(\\xi^s\\) that corresponds to a displacement susceptibility. By considering anisotropic layers under the assumption that TE and TM modes are not coupled, we provide a unified vision of the different models used in optical characterization of 2D materials, including ellipsometry. We build on this to model 3D structures layer per layer and identify their effective permittivity and propagation constants. We show that our model fits existing ellipsometric data with the same reliability as the existing interface models, but with the advantage that multilayer and monolayer systems are described in a same way.

If both the initial plasma density and pulse profile have plane simmetry, then suitable matched upper bounds on the maximum and the relative variations of the initial density, as well as the intensity and duration of the pulse, ensure a strictly hydrodynamic evolution of the electron fluid (without wave-breaking or vacuum-heating) during its whole interaction with the pulse, while ions can be regarded as immobile. We use a recently developed fully relativistic plane model whereby the system of the (Lorentz-Maxwell and continuity) PDEs is reduced into a family of highly nonlinear but decoupled systems of non-autonomous Hamilton equations with one degree of freedom, with the light-like coordinate $\\xi=ct\\!-\\!z$ instead of time $t$ as an independent variable, and new apriori estimates (eased by use of a Liapunov function) of the solutions in terms of the input data (initial density and pulse profile). If the laser spot radius $R$ is finite but not too small the same conclusions hold for the part of the plasma close to the axis $\\vec{z}$ of cylindrical symmetry. These results may help in drastically simplifying the study of extreme acceleration mechanisms of electrons. ",

    "abstract": "Identification of phases in many-body quantum states is arguably among the most important and challenging problems of computational quantum physics. The non-trivial phase structure of geometrically frustrated or finite-density electron systems is the main obstacle that severely limits the applicability of the quantum Monte Carlo, variational, and machine learning methods in many important cases. In this paper, we focus on studying real-valued signful ground-state wave functions of several frustrated quantum spins systems. Under the assumption that the tasks of finding wave function amplitudes and signs can be separated, we show that the signs of the wave functions are easily reconstructed with almost perfect accuracy by means of combinatorial optimization. To this end, we map the problem of finding the wave function sign structure onto an auxiliary classical Ising model which is defined on the Hilbert space basis. Although the parental quantum system might be highly frustrated, we demonstrate that the Ising model does not exhibit significant frustrations and is solvable with standard optimization algorithms such as Simulated Annealing. In particular, given the ground state amplitudes, we reconstruct the signs of the wave functions of a fully-connected random Heisenberg model and the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice, thereby revealing the unelaborated hidden simplicity of many-body sign structures.

Here we demonstrate enhancement of nonlinear optomechanical measurement of mechanical motion by using pairs of coupled optical and mechanical modes in a photonic crystal device. In the same device we show linear optomechanical measurement with a strongly reduced input power and reveal how both enhancements are related. Our design exploits anisotropic mechanical elasticity to create strong coupling between mechanical modes while not changing optical properties. Additional thermo-optic tuning of the optical modes is performed with an auxiliary laser and a thermally-optimised device design. We envision broad use of this enhancement scheme in multimode phonon lasing, two-phonon heralding and eventually nonlinear quantum optomechanics. ",

Excitingly, several optomechanics experiments are now entering the highly sought nonlinear regime where optomechanical interactions are large even for low light levels. Within this regime, new quantum phenomena and improved performance may be achieved, however, an approach for mechanical position measurement and a corresponding nonlinear theoretical toolbox are needed to unlock these capabilities. Here, we develop a framework of cavity quantum optomechanics that captures the nonlinearities of both the radiation-pressure interaction and the cavity response and propose how position measurement can be performed in this regime. Our proposal utilizes optical general-dyne detection to obtain mechanical position information imprinted onto both the optical amplitude and phase quadratures and enables both pulsed and continuous modes of operation. Moreover, our proposal and theoretical framework are readily applicable to current and near-future experiments and will allow a range of advances to be made in e.g. quantum metrology, explorations of the standard quantum limit, and quantum measurement and control.
