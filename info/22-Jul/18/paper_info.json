    "title": "Acceleration of 60 MeV proton beams in the commissioning experiment of  SULF-10 PW laser",
    "abstract": "We report the experimental results of the commissioning phase in the 10 PW laser beamline of Shanghai Superintense Ultrafast Laser Facility (SULF). The peak power reaches 2.4 PW on target without the last amplifying during the experiment. The laser energy of 72\\pm 9 J is directed to a focal spot of ~6 {\\mu}m diameter (FWHM) in 30 fs pulse duration, yielding a focused peak intensity around 2.0 \\times 10^{21} W/cm^2. First laser-proton acceleration experiment is performed using plain copper and plastic targets. High-energy proton beams with maximum cut-off energy up to 62.5 MeV are achieved using copper foils at the optimum target thickness of 4 {\\mu}m via target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA). For plastic targets of tens of nanometers thick, the proton cut-off energy is approximately 20 MeV, showing ring-like or filamented density distributions. These experimental results reflect the capabilities of the SULF-10 PW beamline, e.g., both ultrahigh intensity and relatively good beam contrast. Further optimization for these key parameters is underway, where peak laser intensities of 10^{22}-10^{23} W/cm^2 are anticipated to support various experiments on extreme field physics. ",

    "abstract": "We perform a theoretical and numerical study of the optical properties of both direct and inverse three-dimensional (3D) chiral woodpile structures, and a corresponding chiral Bragg stack. We compute transmission spectra in the helical direction for finite crystals, and photonic band structures, where we ensure the effective index of all structures to be the same. We find that both 3D structures show dual-band circular dichroism, where light with a particular circular polarization state - either left- or right-handed - reveals a broad stop band with major attenuation, whereas the other polarization state is transmitted nearly unimpeded. We observe such gaps in different frequency ranges, with alternating handedness. The appearance of the circular-polarized gaps is successfully interpreted with a physical model wherein the circular polarization either co-rotates or counter-rotates with the chiral structure, thereby effectively leading to a spatially-dependent or a constant refractive index, and thus to the presence or absence of a gap. We find that the presence or absence of circularly polarized gaps is tuned by the transverse periods perpendicular to the chiral axis in both the 3D direct and inverse chiral woodpile crystal structures. The tunability of circular dichroism may find applications as on-chip sensors for circularly polarized light and in the on-chip detection of chiral molecules. ",

To evaluate the BBR shift of an Yb optical lattice clock at KRISS, we installed an in-vacuum BBR shield and made radiation thermometry using a black-coated-sphere thermal probe. After we quantitatively measured the conduction loss of the thermal probe and the effects of all the external radiation sources, we determined the temperature at the atom trap site with an uncertainty of 13 mK, which corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.22 mHz in the clock frequency (a fractional frequency of $4.2\\times10^{-19}$). The total uncertainty of the BBR shift including the atomic response is $9.5\\times10^{-19}$. ",

Using this approach, we demonstrate both second-harmonic generation (with a normalized efficiency of $0.2\\,\\%\\,\\mathrm{W^{-1} cm^{-2}}$) and, to our knowledge, the first degenerate $\\chi^{(2)}$ optical parametric amplifier (with relative gain of $0.02\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ using $3\\,\\mathrm{mW}$ of pump power on-chip at a pump wavelength of $1196\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) using silicon-on-insulator waveguides fabricated in a CMOS-compatible commercial foundry.

The design process involves defining or calculating the phase profile of the metasurface that will yield the desired optical output. Here, we present an inverse design method for determining the phase profile for shaping the intensity profile of a collimated incident beam. The model is based on the concept of optimal transport from non-imaging optics and enables a collimated beam with an arbitrary intensity profile to be redistributed to a desired output intensity profile. We derive the model from the generalized law of refraction and numerically solve the resulting differential equation using a finite-difference scheme. Through a variety of examples, we show that our approach accommodates a range of different input and output intensity profiles, and discuss its feasibility as a design platform for non-imaging optics.

Here, we propose a new analytical approach to estimate the chirp rate of a time lens implemented using an electro-optic phase modulator driven with a single-tone radio frequency voltage. Our approach is based on a user-defined time aperture for the time lens. We observe that the temporal aberrations depend on the amplitude of the phase modulation and the effective time aperture of the time lens. We derive an analytical expression for the maximum phase error that will allow the user to choose the maximal aberration-limited time aperture of the time lens. We apply our formalism to a Fourier-time lens system for the spectral compression of Gaussian pulses and find the optimal parameters of the setup. Our approach will provide a handy tool for efficient temporal system design based on electro-optical time lenses. ",

    "abstract": "We perform a systematic analysis of how ultrafast photoelectron holography is influenced by an elliptically polarized field, with emphasis on quantum interference effects. We find that the interplay of the external field and the binding potential leads to twisted holographic patterns for low ellipticities and recover well-known angular offsets for high ellipticities. Using the Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-field approximation (CQSFA), we assess how the field ellipticity affects specific holographic patterns, such as the fan and the spider. The interplay of the external field and the binding potential leads to twisted holographic patterns in the fan, and to loss of contrast in the spider. This behavior can be traced back to interfering electron trajectories, and unequal changes in tunneling probability due to non-vanishing ellipticity. We also derive tunneling times analytically using the strong-field approximation (SFA), provide estimates for ellipticy ranges for which interference is expected to be prominent, and discuss how to construct continuous electron momentum distributions exploring the rotation symmetry around the origin.
