    "abstract": "In this paper we report on a low energy consumption CMOS-compatible plasmonic modulator based on Franz-Keldysh effect in germanium on silicon. We performed integrated electro-optical simulations in order to optimize the main characteristics of the modulator. A 3.3 $dB$ extinction ratio for a 30 ${\\mu}m$ long modulator is demonstrated under 3 $V$ bias voltage at an operation wavelength of 1647 $nm$. The estimated energy consumption is as low as 20 $fJ/bit$. ",

    "title": "Quantum-limited millimeter wave to optical transduction",
    "abstract": "Long distance transmission of quantum information is a central ingredient of distributed quantum information processors for both computing and secure communication. Transmission between superconducting/solid-state quantum processors necessitates transduction of individual microwave photons to optical photons. Current approaches to transduction employ solid state links between electrical and optical domains, facing challenges from the thermal noise added by the strong classical pumps required for high conversion efficiency and bandwidth. Neutral atoms are an attractive alternative transducer: they couple strongly to optical photons in their ground states, and to microwave/millimeter-wave photons in their Rydberg states. Nonetheless, strong coupling of atoms to both types of photons, in a cryogenic environment to minimize thermal noise, has yet to be achieved. Here we demonstrate quantum-limited transduction of millimeter-wave (mmwave) photons into optical photons using cold $^{85}$Rb atoms as the transducer. We achieve this by coupling an ensemble of atoms simultaneously to a first-of-its-kind, optically accessible three-dimensional superconducting resonator, and a vibration suppressed optical cavity, in a cryogenic ($5$ K) environment. We measure an internal conversion efficiency of $58(11)\\%$, a conversion bandwidth of $360(20)$ kHz and added thermal noise of $0.6$ photons, in agreement with a parameter-free theory. Extensions to this technique will allow near-unity efficiency transduction in both the mmwave and microwave regimes. More broadly, this state-of-the-art platform opens a new field of hybrid mmwave/optical quantum science, with prospects for operation deep in the strong coupling regime for efficient generation of metrologically or computationally useful entangled states and quantum simulation/computation with strong nonlocal interactions.

    "abstract": "Exceptional points, with simultaneous coalescence of eigen-values and eigen-vectors, can be realized with non-Hermitian photonic systems. With the enhanced response, exceptional points have been proposed to improve the performance of photonic sensing. Recently, there are intense debate about the actual sensing advantage of exceptional points. The major concern is that intrinsic noise is also amplified at exceptional points. Here, we aim to clarify the contribution of exceptional points for photonic sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the condition to realize divergent quantum Fisher information in linear non-Hermitian photonic systems. We show that the divergence of quantum Fisher information is the result of lasing threshold, instead of exceptional points. However, exceptional points correspond to the condition that lasing threshold is simultaneously achieved across multiple photonic modes. Therefore, exceptional points can further improve the sensitivity on top of lasing threshold. On the other hand, exceptional points alone cannot provide sensing advantage. ",

    "abstract": "Periodic arrays of noble metal nanoparticles are emblematic nanostructures in photonics. Their ability to sustain localized surface plasmon resonances has been used throughout the years to demonstrate a variety of passive and active functionalities such as enhanced luminescence in dipolar media and LEDs as well as higher responsivities in photoconductive detectors. Here, we show that additional magnetic resonances, associated with inductive current loops between the nanoparticles and accessible with transverse electric waves, emerge in the limit of dense arrays with subwavelength periods. Moreover, their interplay with the plasmons of the system results in spectrally sharp analogues of electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA). We use these metasurfaces to induce changes and enhancements in the emission, absorption, photoconduction, and polarization properties of active layers of PbS nanocrystals, illustrating the potential of EIA beyond the passive functionalities demonstrated so far in literature.

    "abstract": "Previous statistical studies of plasmaspheric hiss investigated the averaged shape of the magnetic field power spectra at various points in the magnetosphere. However, this approach does not consider the fact that very diverse spectral shapes exist at a given L-shell and magnetic local time. Averaging the data together means that important features of the spectral shapes are lost. In this paper, we use an unsupervised machine learning technique to categorize plasmaspheric hiss. In contrast to the previous studies, this technique allows us to identify power spectra that have \"similar\" shapes and study their spatial distribution without averaging together vastly different spectral shapes. We show that strong negative correlations exist between the hiss frequency and bandwidth, which suggests that the observed patterns are consistent with in situ wave growth. ",

In practical studies of high-dimensional reactions, neither extreme is the best choice: frequently a high-level quantum mechanical description is only required for a handful of modes, while the majority of environment modes that do not play a key role in the reactive event of interest are well served with a lower level of theory. In this feature we introduce Modified Filinov filtration as a powerful tool for mixed quantum-classical simulations in a uniform semiclassical framework. ",

Such a system, hosting polaritonic excitations, may be realized experimentally in a wide range of platforms under strong light-matter coupling. By analyzing both the eigenspectrum and the driven-dissipative transport properties of our system, we find that in the strong-coupling regime, increasing disorder leads almost uncoupled dark states to acquire a photonic part, allowing them to inherit polaritonic long-range transport characteristics. Crucially, we show that this disorder-enhanced transport mechanism is increasingly noticeable when the considered dipoles are lossier. ",
