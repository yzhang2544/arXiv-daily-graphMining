    "abstract": "Quenching of thermal emission above 0 K is an unusual material property, essential for future energy, transportation, and space technologies. Despite the great effort invested, nearly complete quenching of thermal radiation rather than some reduction of its flux has only been achieved at low temperatures (below 373 K) and in narrow spectral windows using complex techniques suitable only for small scale objects. In this work, we present a light and flexible composite material that can suppress propagating photonic modes and, in this way, quench thermal radiation while preserving heat transfer (by thermal conduction) at a room and higher temperature below 600 K. This has been achieved by altering the local photonic density of states and consequentially the thermal properties of carbon nanotubes forming a percolating nanofiber network with a thermostable polymeric matrix.

    "title": "Custom nonlinearity profile for integrated quantum light sources",
    "abstract": "Heralded single-photon sources are a fundamental building block for optical quantum technologies. These sources need to be unfiltered and integrated to have good scalability and avoid unnecessary losses. To attain this goal, it is necessary to control the effective nonlinearity seen by the fields as they mix and propagate in a waveguide source. In this paper, we introduce a method to design nonlinear waveguides with arbitrarily shaped effective nonlinearity profiles. The method takes advantage of the fact that the second order nonlinear response is a tensor quantity and thus the local effective nonlinearity of a material depends on the propagation direction of the fields participating in the interaction. Thus, by locally changing the propagation direction of the fields we can modulate the wave-mixing process. Our methods allows for the waveguide fabrication process to be significantly simplified: The material structure of the waveguide is made by a single crystal, no longer needing oriented patterning (OP) or periodic poling (PP). We use our method to design waveguides with a nonlinearity profile that is Gaussian in the propagation length, allowing to generate perfectly pure heralded single photons. ",

Nevertheless, to build next-generation photonic devices that make use of these features, it is first essential to model the all-optical control mechanisms in TMDCs. Herein, a simple model is proposed to quantify the performance of a 35$\\,$\\textmu m long Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguide-integrated all-optical MoSe$_2$ modulator. Using this model, a switching energy of 14.6$\\,$pJ is obtained for a transverse-magnetic (TM) and transverse-electric (TE) polarised pump signals at $\\lambda =\\,$480$\\,$nm. Moreover, maximal extinction ratios of 20.6$\\,$dB and 20.1$\\,$dB are achieved for a TM and TE polarised probe signal at $\\lambda =\\,$500$\\,$nm, respectively, with an ultra-low insertion loss of $<0.3\\,$dB. Moreover, the device operates with an ultrafast recovery time of 50$\\,$ps, while maintaining a high extinction ratio for practical applications. These findings facilitate modeling and designing novel TMDC-based photonic devices. ",

We consider self similarity of the correlation function by means of incomplete similarity. In this framework, we propose a self-similar form of the correlation function, whose scaling exponents cannot be determined by only using the dimensional analysis based on the Kolmogorov's phenomenology. As a result, the scaling laws of the correlation function can depend on the initial separation. This initial-separation dependency is frequently observed in laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations of the relative dispersion, which is directly related to the correlation function, at moderate Reynolds numbers. We numerically verify the self-similar form by direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional energy inverse-cascade turbulence. The involved scaling exponents and the dependencies on finite Reynolds number effects are determined empirically. Then, we consider implication of the scaling laws of the correlation function on the relative dispersion, i.e. the Richardson-Obukhov $t^3$ law. Our results suggest a possibility not to recover the Richardson-Obukhov $t^3$ law at infinite Reynolds number. ",

Netcast performs deep neural network inference by dividing the computational task into two steps, which are split between the server and (edge) client: (1) the server employs a wavelength-multiplexed modulator array to encode the network's weights onto an optical signal in an analog time-frequency basis, and (2) the client obtains the desired matrix-vector product through modulation and time-integrated detection. The simultaneous use of wavelength multiplexing, broadband modulation, and integration detection allows large neural networks to be run at the client by effectively pushing the energy and memory requirements back to the server. The performance and energy efficiency are fundamentally limited by crosstalk and detector noise, respectively. We derive analytic expressions for these limits and perform numerical simulations to verify these bounds. ",

    "abstract": "The Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm is a quantum algorithm expected to accelerate solving large-scale linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To apply the HHL to non-linear problems such as chemical reactions, the system must be linearized. In this study, Carleman linearization was utilized to transform nonlinear first-order ODEs of chemical reactions into linear ODEs. Although this linearization theoretically requires the generation of an infinite matrix, the original nonlinear equations can be reconstructed. For the practical use, the linearized system should be truncated with finite size and analysis precision can be determined by the extent of the truncation. Matrix should be sufficiently large so that the precision is satisfied because quantum computers can treat. Our method was applied to a one-variable nonlinear dy/dt = -y^2 system to investigate the effect of truncation orders in Carleman linearization and time step size on the absolute error. Subsequently, two zero-dimensional homogeneous ignition problems for H2/air and CH4/air gas mixtures were solved. The results revealed that the proposed method could accurately reproduce reference data. Furthermore, an increase in the truncation order in Carleman linearization improved accuracy even with a large time-step size. Thus, our approach can provide accurate numerical simulations rapidly for complex combustion systems. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial lattices are a powerful tool to reveal and study key interaction mechanisms between constituents of condensed matter systems, such as antiferromagnetic interactions leading to geometric frustration. Frustration in magnetic materials is evidenced in their spin degree of freedom, whereas in many-body quantum systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices, coupled lasers, and polariton condensates that are described by a complex order parameter, frustration is scarcely explored in controllable settings. Here, we realize a radically new platform to study geometric frustration using a macroscopic quantum fluid of light based on exciton-polariton condensates. We design pump configurations which drive condensates into an all-optical triangular vortex lattice with each cell possessing a vortex state of charge l = +-1. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of each vortex replaces the role of spin angular momentum in frustrated matter. Our measurements and mean-field calculations reveal that individual pairs of coupled condensates spontaneously arrange their OAM antiparallel, implying a form of artificial orbital antiferromagnetism, with geometric frustration appearing in the triangular graph of three condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate emergence of frustrated phases of driven-dissipative large-scale vortex matter, and open a route towards constructing ordered vortex arrays with nearly arbitrary configurations without directly phase-imprinting or stirring the polariton fluid.

Much remains to be understood concerning the fundamental properties of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in InSbAs quantum wells. We report on the electrical properties of a series of 30 nm InSb$_{1-x}$As$_{x}$ quantum wells grown 40 nm below the surface with three different arsenic mole fractions, x = 0.05, 0.13 and 0.19. The dependencies of mobility on 2DEG density and arsenic mole fraction are analyzed.

High mobility, small effective mass, and strong spin-orbit coupling result in beating in the Shubnikov de Hass oscillations at low magnetic field. Fourier analysis of the Shubnikov de Haas oscillations facilitates extraction of the Rashba spin-orbit parameter ${\\alpha}$ as a function of 2DEG density and quantum well mole fraction.
