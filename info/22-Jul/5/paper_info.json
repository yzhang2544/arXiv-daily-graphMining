    "abstract": "Optically addressable spins in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) attract widespread attention for their potential advantage in on-chip quantum devices, such as quantum sensors and quantum network. A variety of spin defects have been found in hBN, but no convenient and deterministic generation methods have been reported for other defects except negatively charged boron vacancy ($\\rm V_B^-$). Here we report that by using femtosecond laser direct writing technology, we can deterministically create spin defect ensembles with spectra range from 550 nm to 800 nm. Positive single-peak optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals are detected in the presence of longitudinal magnetic field, and the contrast can reach 0.8%. With the appropriate thickness of hBN flakes and femtosecond laser pulse energy, we can deterministically generate bright spin defects in-situ. Our results provide a convenient deterministic method to create spin defects in hBN, which will motivate more endeavors for future researches and applications of spin-based technologies. ",

By pumping the population to one single Hyperfine/Zeeman state, we can enhance the interaction strength and, in principle, amplify the EIT peak. According to our measurements, the EIT peak height can be improved by a factor of two or reduced by one order of magnitude, and linewidth was slightly narrowed by the pumping effect. Similar behavior is also seen by increasing the optical density (OD) of the medium. The EIT feature is predicted quantitatively using a Doppler-free non-perturbation numerical calculation. With and without the optical pumping field, the EIT peak heights collapse onto the same theoretical curve, showing that OP and varying OD have the same effect. In both simulations and measurements, Rydberg EIT enhancement through OP is dependent on the intensity of the probe field and the OD. Our work clarifies the underlying mechanisms of optical pumping and advances Rydberg-atom research. ",

To regularize the problem we use a Bayesian framework with Gaussian random fields. This allows us to estimate the uncertainties of the unknowns by approximating their posterior covariance with a quasi-Newton method. We first test the method for synthetic noisy images of 2D flows and observe that the method successfully reconstructs and segments the noisy synthetic images with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3. Then we conduct a magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) experiment to acquire images of an axisymmetric flow for low ($\\simeq 6$) and high ($>30$) SNRs. We show that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the low SNR images, producing noiseless velocity fields and a smooth segmentation, with negligible errors compared with the high SNR images. This amounts to a reduction of the total scanning time by a factor of 27. At the same time, the method provides additional knowledge about the physics of the flow (e.g. pressure), and addresses the shortcomings of MRV (low spatial resolution and partial volume effects) that otherwise hinder the accurate estimation of wall shear stresses. Although the implementation of the method is restricted to 2D steady planar and axisymmetric flows, the formulation applies immediately to 3D steady flows and naturally extends to 3D periodic and unsteady flows.

We provide a universal condition for maximizing heat transfer that defines the optimal interplay between a material's optical loss and polariton resonance frequency, based on which we introduce tight bounds to near-field heat transfer. With this formalism, one can quantitatively evaluate all polaritonic materials in terms of their performance as near-field thermal emitters. ",

They are of particular importance in the study of flat band systems via the associated nondiffracting compact localized states. However, such states typically appear static, thus not allowing adaptive or evolutionary features of light localization. Here we report on the first experimental realization of an oscillating compact localized state (OCLS). We observe an oscillatory intensity beating during propagation in a two-dimensional photonic decorated Lieb lattice. The photonic system is realized by direct femtosecond laser writing and hosts multiple flat bands at different eigenenergies in its band structure. Our results open new avenues for evolution dynamics in the up to now static phenomenon of light localization in periodic waveguide structures. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art polarimeter calibration is reviewed. Producing many quasi-random polarization states and moving/bending a fiber without changing power allows finding a polarimeter calibration where the degree-of-polarization reaches unity and parasitic polarization-dependent loss is small. Using a polarization scrambler/transformer and a polarimeter a device-under-test can be characterized. Its Mueller matrix can be decomposed into a product of a nondepolarizing Mueller-Jones matrix times a purely depolarizing Mueller matrix. Test polarizations may drift over time. With help of an optical switch the reference device can be measured against an internal reference path. Later, with possibly different test polarizations, the actual device-under-test is measured against the internal reference. Polarization drift and need for repeated reference device measurement are thus overcome. When a patchcord is inserted, connector PDL can be measured, provided that errors are calibrated away, again by fiber moving/bending. Experimentally we have measured PDL with errors <0.004 dB. This easily suffices to measure connector PDL, which is demonstrated. PDL >60 dB was measured when the device under test was a good polarizer. A 20 Mrad/s polarization scrambler with LiNbO3 device generates the test polarizations. The polarimeter can sample at 100 MHz and can store 64M Stokes vectors. During laser frequency scans Mueller matrices can be measured in time intervals as short as 5 us. ",

Here we present a comparative study of efficient frequency mixing using various techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) such as counter-diabatic driving and invariant-based inverse engineering. We show that, it is possible to perform sum frequency generation by properly designing the poling structure of a periodically poled crystal and the coupling between the input lights and the crystal. The required crystal length for frequency conversion is significantly decreases beyond the adiabatic limit. Our approach significantly improves the robustness of the process against the variation in temperature as well as the signal frequency. By introducing a single parameter control technique with constant coupling and combining with the inverse engineering, perturbation theory and optimal control, we show that the phase mismatch can be further optimized with respect to the fluctuations of input wavelength and crystal temperature that results into a novel experimentally realizable mixing scheme.

Using a Bayesian framework, we regularize the problem by introducing a priori information about the unknown parameters in the form of Gaussian random fields. This prior information is updated using the Navier-Stokes problem, an energy-based segmentation functional, and by requiring that the reconstruction is consistent with the $k$-space signals. We create an algorithm that solves this reconstruction problem, and test it for noisy and sparse $k$-space signals of the flow through a converging nozzle. We find that the method is capable of reconstructing and segmenting the velocity fields from sparsely-sampled (15% $k$-space coverage), low ($\\sim$$10$) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, and that the reconstructed velocity field compares well with that derived from fully-sampled (100% $k$-space coverage) high ($>40$) SNR signals of the same flow.
