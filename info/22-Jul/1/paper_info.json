We explain these observations using quantum interference of two dissociation paths coherently accessed by multiple angular momentum transfer channels. The results point to the generic nature of quantum coherence induced into the molecular dynamics by single electron non-resonant scattering ubiquitous in a plasma environment, planetary atmosphere, astrochemistry, etc. ",

    "title": "Surface Passivation of III-V GaAs Nanopillars by Low Frequency Plasma  Deposition of Silicon Nitride for Active Nanophotonic Devices",
    "abstract": "Numerous efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic and optical properties of III-V compound materials via reduction of their nonradiative states, aiming at highly-efficient III-V sub-micrometer devices. Despite many advances, there is still a controversial debate on which combination of chemical treatment and capping dielectric layer can best reproducibly protect the crystal surface of III-Vs, while being compatible with readily available plasma deposition methods. This work reports on a systematic experimental study on the role of sulfide ammonium chemical treatment followed by dielectric coating in the passivation effect of GaAs/AlGaAs nanopillars. Our results conclusively show that the best surface passivation is achieved using ammonium sulfide followed by encapsulation with a thin layer of silicon nitride by low frequency plasma enhanced chemical deposition. Here, the sulfurized GaAs surfaces, the high level of hydrogen ions and the low frequency (380 kHz) excitation plasma that enable intense bombardment of hydrogen, all seem to provide a combined active role in the passivation mechanism of the pillars. We observe up to a 29-fold increase of the photoluminescence (PL) integrated intensity for the best samples as compared to untreated nanopillars. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirms the best treatments show remarkable removal of gallium and arsenic native oxides. Time-resolved micro-PL measurements display nanosecond lifetimes resulting in a record-low surface recombination velocity for dry etched GaAs nanopillars. We achieve robust, stable and long-term passivated nanopillar surfaces which creates expectations for remarkable high internal quantum efficiency (IQE>0.5) in nanoscale light-emitting diodes. The enhanced performance paves the way to many other nanostructures and devices such as miniature resonators, lasers, photodetectors and solar cells. ",

Phys., 2022, 156, 24101.] for simulation of quantum dynamics of extended systems has been shown to be effective in studying one-dimensional systems. Quantum transport in these systems are typically studied at a constant temperature. However, temperature seems to be a very obvious parameter that can be spatially changed to control the quantum transport. Here, MS-TNPI is used to study ``non-equilibrium'' effects of an externally imposed temperature gradient on the quantum transport in one-dimensional extended quantum systems. ",

In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to precisely align and embed hBN and TMDs within background-free silicon nitride microring resonators. Through the Purcell effect, high-purity hBN emitters exhibit a cavity-enhanced spectral coupling efficiency up to $46\\%$ at room temperature, which exceeds the theoretical limit for cavity-free waveguide-emitter coupling and previous demonstrations by nearly an order-of-magnitude. The devices are fabricated with a CMOS-compatible process and exhibit no degradation of the 2D material optical properties, robustness to thermal annealing, and 100 nm positioning accuracy of quantum emitters within single-mode waveguides, opening a path for scalable quantum photonic chips with on-demand single-photon sources.

    "abstract": "Perturbation theory (PT) might be one of the most powerful and fruitful tools for both physicists and chemists, which evoked an explosion of applications with the blooming of atomic and subatomic physics. Even though PT is well-used today, techniques for PT are significantly lacking in quantum computing. Here we present a quantum circuit estimating both the energy and eigenstates corrections with PT methods, which we claim is far superior to the classical version when estimating the second order energy correction. Our approach is further demonstrated with an application on the extended Hubbard model, where numerical simulation based on qiskit is also presented. Unlike the popular quantum variational circuit, there is no training or optimizing process in our circuit, and all parameters are derived from the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our work offers a new approach to studying complex systems with quantum devices, which might shed light on the quantum implementation of the more intricate methods based on PT. ",

The performance of free-space optical communication can be significantly degraded by atmospheric turbulence effects, such as beam wander and signal fluctuations. We used a 660 nm tracking laser to reduce atmospheric effects, by analyzing the fast beam wander and slow temporal beam drift, using this information to correct the quantum channel alignment of the 810 nm signal photons. In this work, the active reflector consisted of a mirror, a 6-axis hexapod stage, and a long-range wireless bridge. The slow drift of the beam path due to outdoor temperature changes was steered and controlled using wireless optical feedback between the receiver units and the active reflector. Our work provides useful knowledge for improved control of beam paths in outdoor conditions, which can be developed to ensure high quality quantum information transfer in real-world scenarios, such as an unmanned FSO link for urban quantum communication or retro-reflective quantum communication links.

    "abstract": "Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) provide a robust solution-based approach to efficient solar cells, bright light-emitting devices, and quantum sources of light. Quantifying heterogeneity and understanding coupling between dots is critical for these applications. We use double-nanohole optical trapping to size individual dots and correlate to emission energy shifts from quantum confinement. We were able to assemble a second dot in the trap, which allows us to observe the coupling between dots. We observe a systematic red-shift of 1.1 $\\pm$ 0.6 meV in the emission wavelength. Theoretical analysis shows that the observed shift is consistent with resonant energy transfer and is unusually large due to moderate-to-large quantum confinement in PQDs. This demonstrates the promise of PQDs for entanglement in quantum information applications. This work enables future in situ control of PQD growth as well as studies of the coupling between small PQD assemblies with quantum information applications in mind. ",

Using a custom-grown NV-enriched diamond combined with a noise cancellation scheme designed for high-frequency sensing, we demonstrate a Rabi-sequence-based magnetometer able to detect microwave fields near 2.87 GHz with a record sensitivity of 3.4 pT/$\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$. We demonstrate both amplitude and phase sensing and project tunability over a 300 MHz frequency range.
