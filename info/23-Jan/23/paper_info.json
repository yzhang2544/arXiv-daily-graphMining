    "abstract": "Long ground-Rydberg coherence lifetime is interesting for implementing high-fidelity quantum logic gates, many-body physics, and other quantum information protocols. However, the potential well formed by a conventional far-off-resonance red-detuned optical-dipole trap that is attractive for ground-state cold atoms is usually repulsive for Rydberg atoms, which will result in the rapid loss of atoms and low repetition rate of the experimental sequence. Moreover, the coherence time will be sharply shortened due to the residual thermal motion of cold atoms. These issues can be addressed by a one-dimensional magic lattice trap, which can form a deeper potential trap than the traveling wave optical dipole trap when the output power is limited. In addition, these common techniques for atomic confinement generally have certain requirements for the polarization and intensity stability of the laser. Here, we demonstrated a method to suppress both the polarization drift and power fluctuation only based on the phase management of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer for a one-dimensional magic lattice trap. With the combination of three wave plates and the interferometer, we used the instrument to collect data in the time domain, analyzed the fluctuation of laser intensity, and calculated the noise power spectral density. We found that the total intensity fluctuation comprising laser power fluctuation and polarization drift was significantly suppressed, and the noise power spectral density after closed-loop locking with a typical bandwidth of 1-3000 Hz was significantly lower than that under the free running of the laser system. Typically, at 1000 Hz, the noise power spectral density after locking was about 10 dB lower than that under the free running of a master oscillator power amplifier system.The intensity-polarization control technique provides potential applications.

The photoresponse was recorded under the illumination of IR light of wavelength 850 nm and intensity of around 0.216 mW/cm^2.

The method proposed is able to correctly characterize resonance Raman scattering and enhancement, including the description of overtones and combination bands. The absorption spectrum is obtained at the same time and the vibrational fine structure can be reproduced for long excited state relaxation times.

Both Rayleigh- and SH-SAW delay lines have been designed and fabricated with a Ni81Fe19/Cu bilayer integrated on ST-cut quartz. Given the same wavelength, the measured power absorption of SH-SAW is four orders of magnitudes higher than that of the Rayleigh SAW.

Our calculations show that at relatively low absorbed energies (the electron temperature $T_e$$\\lesssim$7 kK), the lattice of tantalum undergoes noticeable hardening. The hardening leads to the change of the tantalum complete melting threshold under these conditions. Calculations suggest that for the isochorically heated Ta film, if such hardening really occurs, the complete melting threshold will be at least 25% higher. It is also shown that the body-centered cubic structures of W and Ta crystals become dynamically unstable when the electronic subsystem is heated to sufficiently high temperatures ($T_e$$>$22 kK). This lead to their complete melting on the sub-picosecond time scale. ",

A key, yet unrealized, requirement of these experiments is the ability to achieve full quantum control over the complex internal structure of the molecules. Here, we establish coherent control of individual quantum states in a polyatomic molecule, calcium monohydroxide (CaOH), and use these techniques to demonstrate a method for searching for the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). Optically trapped, ultracold CaOH molecules are prepared in a single quantum state, polarized in an electric field, and coherently transferred into an eEDM sensitive state where an electron spin precession measurement is performed. To extend the coherence time of the measurement, we utilize eEDM sensitive states with tunable, near-zero magnetic field sensitivity. The spin precession coherence time is limited by AC Stark shifts and uncontrolled magnetic fields. These results establish a path for eEDM searches with trapped polyatomic molecules, towards orders-of-magnitude improved experimental sensitivity to time-reversal-violating physics. ",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous emission (SE) rate of any light emitters directly scales with the locally available modes for photons. The emission rate can be modified, by changing the dielectric environment of light emitters. Generally cavities with modes in resonance to light emission frequency, are used to amplify the light emission rate. The Fermi golden rule predicts that if the cavity modes are offresonant to the emission frequency, then the SE rate is suppressed. In this study, we demonstrate that the SE of colloidal alloyed quantum dots is inhibited by coupling them to chemically synthesized Silver nanowires and Silver nanoplatelet systems. The silver nanoplatelet and silver nanowire plasmonic resonance modes are in ultraviolet and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The quantum dots emit in visible region of light. This off-resonant weak coupling of emitters and cavities results in emission rate suppression and is quantified by time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. TRPL decay profiles show that the emission rate can be suppressed by coupling self assembled quantum dot monolayers to a single silver nanoplatelet and a single silver nanowire respectively. ",

    "abstract": "A major limitation of transient optical spectroscopy is that relatively high laser fluences are required to enable broadband, multichannel detection with acceptable signal-to-noise levels. Under typical experimental conditions, many condensed phase and nanoscale materials exhibit fluence dependent dynamics, including higher order effects such as carrier-carrier annihilation. With the proliferation of commercial laser systems, offering both high repetition rates and high pulse energies, has come new opportunities for high sensitivity pump-probe measurements at low pump fluences. However, experimental considerations needed to fully leverage the statistical advantage of these laser systems has not been fully described. Here we demonstrate a high repetition rate, broadband transient spectrometer capable of multichannel shot-to-shot detection at 90 kHz. Importantly, we find that several high-speed cameras exhibit a time-domain fixed pattern noise resulting from interleaved analog-to-digital converters that is particularly detrimental to the conventional \"ON/OFF\" modulation scheme used in pump-probe spectroscopy. Using a modified modulation and data processing scheme, we achieve a noise level of $10^{-5}$ OD for an integration time of four seconds, an order of magnitude lower than for commercial 1 kHz transient spectrometers. We leverage the high sensitivity of this system to measure the differential transmission of monolayer graphene at low pump fluence. We show that signals on the order of $10^{-6}$ OD can be measured, enabling a new data acquisition regime for low dimensional materials. ",

The reason for this is that these resolutions are based on analogies with deparametrizable models for which the problem can be solved, while I argue in this paper that there are good reasons for doubting about these resolutions when the theory is not deparametrizable, which is the case of general relativity. I introduce an example of a non-deparametrizable model, a double harmonic oscillator system expressed by its Jacobi action, and argue that the problem of time for this model is not solvable, in the sense that its canonical quantization doesn't lead to the quantum theory of two harmonic oscillators and the standard resolutions of the problem of time don't work for this case. I argue that as general relativity is strongly analogous to this model, one should take seriously the view that the canonical quantization of general relativity doesn't lead to a meaningful quantum theory. Finally, I comment that this has an impact on the foundations of different approaches to quantum gravity. ",

    "abstract": "The Xilinx ZCU111 Radio Frequency System on Chip (RFSoC) is a promising solution for reading out large arrays of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). The board boasts eight on-chip 12-bit / 4.096 GSPS analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) and eight 14-bit / 6.554 GSPS digital-to-analogue converters (DACs), as well as field programmable gate array (FPGA) resources of 930,000 logic cells and 4,272 digital signal processing (DSP) slices. While this is sufficient data converter bandwidth for the readout of 8,000 MKIDs, with a 2 MHz channel-spacing, and a 1 MHz sampling rate (per channel), additional FPGA resources are needed to perform the DSP needed to process this large number of MKIDs. A solution to this problem is the new Xilinx RFSoC 2x2 board. This board costs only one fifth of the ZCU111 while still providing the same logic resources as the ZCU111, albeit with only a quarter of the data converter resources. Thus, using multiple RFSoC 2x2 boards would provide a better balance between FPGA resources and data converters, allowing the full utilization of the RF bandwidth provided by the data converters, while also lowering the cost per pixel value of the readout system, from approximately EUR2.50 per pixel with the ZCU111, to EUR1 per pixel.

One particular recent development has been searches for light dark matter (LDM), which is typically defined as candidates with masses in the range of keV to GeV. In searches for LDM, eV-scale and below detector thresholds are needed to detect the small amount of kinetic energy that is imparted to nuclei in a recoil. One such detector technology that can be applied to LDM searches is that of Transition-Edge Sensors (TESs). Operated at cryogenic temperatures, these sensors can achieve the required thresholds, depending on the optimization of the design. In this thesis, I will motivate the evidence for DM and the various DM candidates beyond the WIMP. I will then detail the basics of TES characterization, expand and apply the concepts to an athermal phonon sensor--based Cryogenic PhotoDetector (CPD), and use this detector to carry out a search for LDM at the surface. The resulting exclusion analysis provides the most stringent limits in DM-nucleon scattering cross section (comparing to contemporary searches) for a cryogenic detector for masses from 93 to 140 MeV, showing the promise of athermal phonon sensors in future LDM searches. Furthermore, unknown excess background signals are observed in this LDM search, for which I rule out various possible sources and motivate stress-related microfractures as an intriguing explanation. Finally, I will shortly discuss the outlook of future searches for LDM for various detection channels beyond nuclear recoils. ",
