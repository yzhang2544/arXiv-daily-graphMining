    "abstract": "Controlling both the spectral bandwidth and directional range of emitted thermal radiation is a fundamental challenge in modern photonics and materials research. Recent work has shown that materials with a spatial gradient in their epsilon near zero response can support broad spectrum directionality in their emissivity, enabling high radiance to specific angles of incidence. However, this capability has been limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials supporting phonon-polariton resonances over long-wave infrared wavelengths. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate an approach using doped III-V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth and directionality of infrared emissivity. We epitaxially grow and characterize InAs-based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and peak directions as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness. Due to its easy-to-fabricate geometry we believe this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications.

Reliable turnkey operation with sub-opticalcycle and sub-femtosecond timing jitter is key to the success of many intriguing microcomb applications at the intersection of ultrafast optics and microwave electronics. Here we propose a novel approach to demonstrate the first turnkey Brillouin-DKS frequency comb. Our approach with a Chimera cavity offers essential benefits that are not attainable previously, including phase insensitivity, self-healing capability, deterministic selection of DKS state, and access to the ultralow noise comb state. The demonstrated turnkey Brillouin-DKS frequency comb achieves a fundamental comb linewidth of 100 mHz and DKS timing jitter of 1 femtosecond for averaging times up to 56 {\\mu}s. The approach is universal and generalizable to various device platforms for user-friendly and field-deployable comb devices. ",

However, we show that the resulting spatial patterns of vortices are strongly defined by the symmetry of the wave packet evolving in the optical lattice but not by lattice topological properties. Our findings reveal the underlying physics by connecting the symmetry and OAM conversion, and provide a simple and efficient method to create regularly-distributed multiple vortices by unstructured light.

    "abstract": "The coherent transduction of information between microwave and optical domains is a fundamental building block for future quantum networks. A promising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using high-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical modes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices require a relatively large photon population in the cavity to enhance the acousto-optic coupling, the heat arising from undesirable optical absorption, however, generates thermal phonons that ultimately hinder their operation in the quantum regime. One way to overcome this problem is by using dissipative optomechanics. In this framework, photons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator, reducing the need for a large intra-cavity photon population. Hitherto, such dissipative optomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies, precluding the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains. Here, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the sideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the optical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the impact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and optical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the mechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical coupling rate compared to previous works. The present demonstration opens a path to strongly dissipative optomechanical devices with nearly noiseless operation in the quantum regime. ",

In optical fiber communication, the classic direct detection obtains only the intensity of the optical field, while the coherent detection counterpart utilizes both phase and polarization diversities at the expense of beating with a narrow-linewidth and high-stable local oscillator (LO). Herein, we propose and demonstrate a four-dimensional Jones space optical field recovery (4-D JSFR) scheme without LO. The information encoded on the intensity and phase of both polarizations can be captured by the polarization-diversity full-field receiver structure and subsequently extracted through deep neural network-aided field recovery. It achieves similar electrical spectral efficiency as standard intradyne coherent detection. The fully recovered optical field can extend the transmission distance beyond the power fading limitation induced by fiber chromatic dispersion. Furthermore, the LO-free advantage makes 4-D JSFR suitable for monolithic photonic integration, offering a spectrally efficient and cost-effective candidate for large-scale data center applications. Our results could motivate a fundamental paradigm shift in the optical field recovery theory and future optical transceiver design. ",

    "abstract": "On-chip efficient nonlinear functions are instrumental in escalating the utilities and performance of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), especially for a wide range of classical and quantum applications, such as tunable coherent radiation, optical frequency conversion, spectroscopy, quantum science, etc. Lithium tantalate (LT) has been widely used in nonlinear wavelength converters, surface acoustic wave resonators, and electro-optic, acoustic-optic devices owing to its excellent optical properties. Here, we fabricated a Z-cut lithium tantalate on insulator (LTOI) microdisk with high quality(Q) factors in both telecom (10$^{6}$) and visible (10$^{5}$) bands by optimizing the fabrication. With the Q factor of the LTOI microdisk increasing, we can obtain higher pump light intensity in the cavity which is beneficial to get more optical nonlinear effect easily. By making use of the mode phase matching of interacting waves and inputting high pump power, we experimentally observed on-chip near-infrared light, visible (red, green), and ultraviolet (UV) from microresonator-based $ \\chi^{(2)}-\\chi^{(2)}$, $ \\chi^{(2)}-\\chi^{(3)}$, and $\\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear processes such as cascaded four-wave mixing (cFWM), cascaded sum-frequency generation (cSFG), third harmonic generation (THG), second harmonic generation (SHG).

Methods: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images of 30 eyes from 20 healthy controls, 21 eyes of diabetic patients with no DR (NoDR) and 26 eyes from 22 patients with mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed in this study. The OCTA images were centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections of the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) were obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative OCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF), and normalized blood flow index (NBFI). Each feature was calculated from both the SVP and DCP and their sensitivity to distinguish the three cohorts of the study were evaluated. Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable of distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image. Comparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the controls from NoDR and mild NPDR. However, neither BVD nor BFF was sensitive enough to separate NoDR from the healthy controls. Conclusion: The NBFI has been demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker of early DR, revealing retinal blood flow abnormality better than traditional BVD and BFF. The NBFI in the DCP was verified as the most sensitive biomarker, supporting that diabetes affects the DCP earlier than SVP in DR. ",

Here we identify quantum phase transitions in that model between fermion-pair and exciton condensations based on a geometric analysis of the convex set of ground-state 2-particle reduced density matrices (2-RDMs). The 2-RDM set provides a finite representation of the infinite parameter space of Hamiltonians that readily reveals a fermion-pair condensate phase and two distinct exciton condensate phases, as well as the emergence of first- and second-order phase transitions as the particle number of the system is increased. The set, furthermore, shows that the fermion-exciton condensate (FEC) lies along the second-order phase transition between the exciton and fermion-pair condensate phases. The detailed information about the exciton and fermion-pair phases, the forces behind these phase, as well as their associated transitions provides additional insight into the formation of the FEC condensate, which we anticipate will prove useful in its experimental realization.

However, the Gamma point at zero-frequency of a photonic system is an intrinsic degeneracy due to the polarization degree of freedom of electromagnetic waves. We show here that in chiral photonic crystals, such an intrinsic degeneracy node carries +(-)2 chiral topological charge and the topological characters is the same as a spin-1 Weyl point manifested as a triple degeneracy of two linear propagating bands intersecting a flat band representing the electrostatic solution. Such an intrinsic triple degeneracy point (TDP) at Gamma is usually buried in bulk band projections and the topological charge at photonic zero-frequency has never been observed. Here, by imposing space-group screw symmetry to the chiral photonic crystal, the Brillouin zone boundary is transformed into an oppositely charged nodal surface enclosing the Gamma point. The emergent Fermi-arcs on sample surface are then forced to connect the bulk band projections of these topological singularities, revealing the embedded non-trivial topology. ",

    "abstract": "Tremendous efforts in recent years towards devising variants of near- and long-term quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry provide us with an impetus to go beyond known conventional approaches to treat quantum many-body theory in the framework of quantum computing. In this work, we identify that a quantum linear solver (the HHL algorithm) can be employed to solve quantum many-body theoretic equations (linearized coupled cluster (LCC) equations), and implement it to obtain precise estimates of the correlation energy of molecular systems. It is important to note that LCC equations involve a non-unitary wave operator, as opposed to the unitary operators that one is usually accustomed to, in quantum computing. A key feature of the work involves modifying the HHL algorithm to reduce circuit depth significantly while retaining the precision in correlation energies to a significant degree. To this end, we formulate, implement, and verify the reduced HHL approach in combination with a pipeline-based optimization procedure. We carry out two proof-of-principle hardware computations on the 11-qubit IonQ machine, with the first being the potential energy curve for the $H_2$ molecule, to demonstrate that HHL adapted to LCC works on hardware. In the second computation, we show that our shallow-depth implementation yields reasonable results on hardware for the $H_3^+$ molecule. ",
