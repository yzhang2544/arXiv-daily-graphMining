    "abstract": "We propose a magnetic laser in a subwavelength system consisting of a high-refractive-index dielectric cavity and an active medium formed by magnetic quantum emitters. Stimulated emissions of magnetic quantum emitters induced by their coherent interactions with quantized magnetic fields of a cavity are theoretically considered. The condition to archive such a magnetic laser is obtained. Numerical results show that magnetic lasers are feasible in some realistic systems, for example, a silicon disk of high-quality whispering gallery modes with embedded emitters. Furthermore, the competitions between the electric interaction and magnetic one in terms of their Purcell factors are also considered in some magnetic laser achievable systems. In a wavelength-scale silicon block of a high-order magnetic mode, the ratio of magnetic Purcell factor to the electric one can reach more than ~103 large. Our results open up ways to enhanced magnetic light-matter interactions. ",

    "title": "Free-electron superfluorescence: collective optical dynamics at  deep-subwavelength resolution",
    "abstract": "Long-range coherence and correlations between electrons in solids are the cornerstones for developing future quantum materials and devices. In 1954, Dicke described correlated spontaneous emission from closely packed quantum emitters, forming the theoretical basis of superradiance and superfluorescence. Since then, it has remained an open challenge to observe such phenomena with nanometer spatial resolution, precisely the important scale at which the collective correlations occur. Here, we report the first instance of free-electron-driven superfluorescence - superfluorescent cathodoluminescence - enabling us to excite and observe correlations at nanometer spatial scales. To exemplify this concept in our experiments, superlattices of lead halide perovskite quantum dots are excited by focused pulses of multiple free electrons. The electrons trigger superfluorescence: collective ultrafast emission observed at rates faster than both the lifetime and decoherence time. By controlling the area illuminated by the electron beam, we create a transition from a non-correlated spontaneous emission to a correlated superfluorescent emission. The observed signatures of superfluorescence are a reduction of the intrinsic emitter lifetime, a narrower linewidth, and a distinct redshift. We develop the theory of superfluorescent cathodoluminescence, which matches the results and highlights the unique features of electron-driven versus light-driven superfluorescence. Our observation and theory introduce a novel way to characterize coherence and correlations in quantum materials with nanometer spatial resolution, a key for future engineering of quantum devices. ",

    "abstract": "We report the development of laser systems -- a \"Voigt laser\" -- using a Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter as the frequency-selective element, working at the wavelength of 780 nm of $^{87}$Rb-D2 resonance line. Compared with Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter, the Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter can generate a stronger and more uniform magnetic field with a compact size of magnet, and obtains a transmission spectrum with narrower linewidth and more stable lineprofile. In this case, the frequency stability of the Voigt laser reaches 5$\\times$10$^{-9}$ at the averaging time of 200 s, and the wavelength fluctuation of 8-hours free operation is $\\pm$0.1 pm. Besides, the Voigt laser has greater immunity to diode current than the Faraday laser, with a wavelength fluctuation of $\\pm$0.5 pm in the current range from 73 mA to 150 mA. Finally, the Voigt laser frequency can be controlled by the cell temperature of the Voigt optical filter, which is expected to achieve a frequency detuning of 20 GHz. Consequently, the Voigt laser, whose frequency could correspond to the atomic transition frequency by tuning the cell temperature, obtains good robustness to the current and temperature fluctuation of laser diode, and could realize a compact optical standard for precise measurement once stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy.

A novel group extraction method enables modeling the effective index's ($n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) sensitivity to local process variations without the presumption of variation source. Use of Euler-bend Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) fabricated in a 300~mm wafer run allow model parameter extraction at widths up to 2.5~$\\mu$m (highly multi-mode) with strong suppression of higher-order mode excitation. Experimental results prove the reported model can self-consistently describe waveguide phase, loss, and thermo-optic behavior across all measured devices over an unprecedented range of optical bandwidth, waveguide widths, and temperatures.

On this regard, large frame Earth based ring laser gyroscopes are top instrumentation as far as bandwidth, long term operation and sensitivity are concerned. Their classical sensitivity limit is given by the shot-noise of the two beams counter propagating inside the cavity usually considered as two independent propagating modes. Thus, it is given by the sum of the shot-noise associated to each beam. Here we prove that the GINGERINO active ring laser prototype upper limiting noise allows an unprecedented sensitivity close to 10$^{-15}$ rad/sec. This is more than a factor 10 better than the theoretical prediction so far accounted for ring lasers shot-noise. ",

By employing state-of-art quantum subroutines including the quantum SWAP test and quantum amplitude amplification, we show how a quadratic speedup can be obtained over the classical algorithm, in principle. Utilization of quantum computation also allows the algorithm to match -- at little additional computational cost -- full density matrices at fragment boundaries, instead of being limited to 1-RDMs. Current quantum computers are small, but quantum bootstrap embedding provides a potentially generalizable strategy for harnessing such small machines through quantum fragment matching.

We give a complete quantum mechanical analysis of multiparameter estimation of the temperatures on the source plane. We find the optimal detection modes by combining incoming modes with an optimized unitary that enables the most informative measurement based on photon counting in the detection modes and saturates the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound from the symmetric logarithmic derivative for the parameter set of temperatures. In our numerical analysis, we achieved a quantum-enhanced super-resolution by reconstructing an image using the maximum likelihood estimator with a pixel size of 3 km, which is ten times smaller than the spatial resolution of SMOS with comparable parameters. Further, we find the optimized unitary for uniform temperature distribution on the source plane, with the temperatures corresponding to the average temperatures of the image. Even though the corresponding unitary was not optimized for the specific image, it still gives a super-resolution compared to local measurement scenarios for the theoretically possible maximum number of measurements.

    "abstract": "A small 4-channels time-delayed complex perceptron is used as a silicon photonics neural network (NN) device to compensate for chromatic dispersion in optical fiber links. The NN device is experimentally tested with non-return-to-zero optical signals at 10 Gbps after propagation through up to 125 km optical fiber link. During the learning phase, a separation-loss function is optimized in order to maximally separate the transmitted levels of 0s from the 1s, which implies an optimization of the bit-error-rate. Testing of the NN device shows that the excess losses introduced by the NN device are compensated by the gain in transmitted signal equalization for a link longer than 100 km. The measured data are reproduced by a model which accounts for the optical link and the neural network device. This allows simulating the network performances for higher data rates, where the device shows improvement with respect to the benchmark both in terms of performance as well as ease of use. ",

Here, we study a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device where two quantum dot arrays are separated by an elongated quantum dot (340 nm long, 50 nm wide). We monitor charge transitions of the elongated quantum dot by measuring radiofrequency single-electron currents to a reservoir to which we connect a lumped-element resonator. We operate the dot as a single electron box to achieve charge sensing of remote quantum dots in each array, separated by a distance of 510 nm. Simultaneous charge detection on both ends of the elongated dot demonstrates that the charge is well distributed across its nominal length, supported by the simulated quantum-mechanical electron density. Our results illustrate how single-electron boxes can be realised with versatile foot- prints that may enable novel and compact quantum processor layouts, offering distributed charge sensing in addition to the possibility of mediated coupling.

Relatively complex quantum photonic circuits have already been demonstrated; however, sources used so far relied on parametric-down-conversion. Hence, the efficiency and scalability are intrinsically limited by the probabilistic nature of the sources. Quantum emitter-based single-photon sources are free of this limitation, but frequency matching of multiple emitters within a single circuit remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a key component in this regard in the form of a fully monolithic GaAs circuit combing two frequency-matched quantum dot single-photon sources interconnected with a low-loss on-chip beamsplitter connected via single-mode ridge waveguides. This device enabled us to perform a two-photon interference experiment on-chip with visibility reaching 66%, limited by the coherence of the emitters. Our device could be further scaled up, providing a clear path to increase the complexity of quantum circuits toward fully scalable integrated quantum technologies. ",
