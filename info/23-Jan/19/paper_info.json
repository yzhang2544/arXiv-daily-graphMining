    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics, superfluids and capillary fluids are closely related: it is thermodynamics that connects them. Liu procedure is applied to analyze the thermodynamic requirements, and the comparison to the traditional method of divergence separation highlights the role of spacetime. It is shown that perfect Korteweg fluids are holographic. The conditions when a complex field can represent the fluid density and velocity fields and when the complex field becomes a wave function of quantum mechanics are treated. The bridge between field and particle representations of physical systems is holography, and the key to holography is the Second Law. ",

    "abstract": "Surface electromagnetic waves are the main carriers of the highly localized in-plane signal in planar antennas and photonic devices. However, the polarization degree of freedom is generally absent for surface waves as far as it is still a challenge to excite the surface waves with a necessary polarization state. In this letter, for the first time, we propose a method to excite the surface waves of arbitrary polarization using the self-complementary metasurfaces obeying Babinet's duality principle. Namely, we demonstrate the excitation of surface waves with (i) linear horizontal and vertical, (ii) linear diagonal, (iii) right- and left-handed circular, and (iv) elliptical polarizations covering, in principle, a whole Poincare sphere of polarization states. Finally, we analyze the impact of substrate on the efficiency of polarization-demanded surface waves excitation. The results obtained may find the numerous applications in planar photonic and flat optical polarization devices. ",

    "abstract": "Ion transport is a fundamental process in many physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, and especially in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Despite its immense importance, there are no demonstrations of label-free, spatially and temporally resolved ion imaging in the solution phase under operando conditions. Here we spatiotemporally map ion concentration gradient evolution in solution and yield ion transport parameters by refining interferometric reflection microscopy, obviating the need for absorptive or fluorescent labels. As an example, we use an electrochemical cell with planar electrodes to drive concentration gradients in a ferricyanide-based aqueous redox electrolyte, and we observe the lateral spatiotemporal evolution of ions via concentration-dependent changes to the refractive index. Analysis of an evolving spatiotemporal ion distribution directly yields the diffusivity of the redox-active species. The simplicity of this approach makes it amenable to probing local ion transport behavior in a wide range of electrochemical, bioelectronic, and electrophysiological systems. ",

    "abstract": "Optically addressable spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become a promising platform for quantum sensing. While sensitivity of these defects are limited by their interactions with the spin environment in hBN, inefficient microwave delivery can further reduce their sensitivity. Hare, we design and fabricate a microwave double arc resonator for efficient transferring of the microwave field at 3.8 GHz. The spin transitions in the ground state of VB- are coupled to the frequency of the microwave cavity which results in enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast. In addition, the linewidth of the ODMR signal further reduces, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity as low as 42.4 microtesla per square root of hertz. Our robust and scalable device engineering is promising for future employment of spin defects in hBN for quantum sensing. ",

    "abstract": "We present a study of factors affecting the energy spread of ion beams extracted from a Charge Breeder Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (CB-ECRIS). The comprehensive simulations, supported by experiments with a Retarding Field Analyser (RFA), reveal that the longitudinal and transverse energy spread of the extracted beams are strongly affected by the electrostatic focusing effects, namely the extraction geometry and plasma beam boundary, to the extent that the electrostatic effects dominate over the magnetic field induced rotation of the beam or the effect of plasma potential and ion temperature. The dominance of the electrostatic focusing effect over the magnetic field induced rotation complicates parametric studies of the transverse emittance as a function of the magnetic field strength, and comparison of emittance values obtained with different ion sources having different extraction designs. Our results demonstrate that the full ion beam energy spread, relevant for the downstream accelerator, can be measured with the RFA only when all ions are collected. On the contrary, studying the effect of plasma properties (plasma potential and ion temperature) on the longitudinal energy spread requires heavy collimation of the beam accepting only ions near the symmetry axis of the beam for which the electrostatic and magnetic effects are suppressed. As the extraction system of the CB-ECRIS is similar to a conventional ECRIS, the conclusions of the study can be generalised to apply for all high charge state ECR ion sources. Finally, we present the results of systematic plasma potential measurements of the Phoenix-type CB-ECRIS at LPSC, varying the source potential, the microwave power and the axial magnetic field srength. It was observed that the plasma potential increases with the extraction magnetic field and the microwave power. ",

Here, solid immersion lenses are demonstrated in silicon carbide using a novel fabrication protocol combining grayscale lithography and hard-mask techniques to allow nearly hemispherical lenses of 5 $\\mu$m radius to be etched into the substrate. The technique is highly scalable and compatible with CMOS technology, and device aspect ratios can be tuned after resist patterning by controlling the chemistry of the subsequent dry etch. These results provide a low-cost, high-throughput and industrially-relevant alternative to focused ion beam milling for the creation of high-aspect-ratio, rounded microstructures. ",

In this paper, we demonstrate the superiority of a first-principle nonlocal model -- Wigner function -- in treating singular potentials which are often used to model the interaction between point charges in quantum science. The nonlocal nature of the Wigner equation is fully exploited to convert the singular potential into the Wigner kernel with weak or even no singularity, and thus highly accurate numerical approximations are achievable, which are hardly designed when the singular potential is taken into account in the local Schr\\\"odinger equation. The Dirac delta function, the logarithmic, and the inverse power potentials are considered. Numerically converged Wigner functions under all these singular potentials are obtained with an operator splitting spectral method, and display many interesting quantum behaviors as well. ",

Widely-used ansatzes including the Slater determinants and Unitary Coupled Cluster, employ parameterized fermionic excitation gates, with the latter resulting in deep quantum circuits that scale at least polynomially with the system size $N$. Here we propose an alternate paradigm for fermionic ansatz state preparation inspired by data-loading circuits methods developed for quantum machine learning. Our approach provides a shallower, yet scalable $O(d\\log^2 N)$ two-qubit gate depth preparation of $d$-fermion Slater determinants and correlated states, a subexponential improvement in gate depth over existing approaches. This is particularly important as it can be implemented on planar architectures without qubit swapping overheads, thereby enabling the use of larger basis sets needed for high-precision quantum chemistry studies on near-term quantum devices.

Compared to physically motivated ansatzes, hardware heuristic ansatzes usually lead to a shallower circuit, but it may still be too deep for an NISQ device. Inspired by the quantum neural network, we propose a new hardware heuristic ansatz where the circuit depth can be significantly reduced by introducing ancilla qubits, which makes a practical simulation of a chemical reaction with more than 20 atoms feasible on a currently available quantum computer. More importantly, the expressibility of this new ansatz can be improved by increasing either the depth or the width of the circuit, which makes it adaptable to different hardware environments. These results open a new avenue to develop practical applications of quantum computation in the NISQ era. ",

The uniformity of the superconducting film used for the fabrication of MKIDs arrays is often regarded as the main limiting factor to the pixel yield of an array. In this paper we will present data on the uniformity of the TiN/Ti/TiN multilayers deposited at the Tyndall National Institute and compare these results with a statistical model that evaluates how inhomogeneities affect the pixel yield of an array.
