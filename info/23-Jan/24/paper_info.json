    "abstract": "Low frequency seismic responses have considerably different characteristics than conventional band responses and require acquisition technologies that are capable of meeting far greater requirements. Seismic sources must deliver forces at lower frequencies that are considerably larger than the forces delivered by modern sources at conventional band frequencies in order to achieve comparable signal-to-noise ratios for many traditional interface-related seismic responses. Source efforts that are only comparable to conventional band source efforts are not adequate. Low frequency seismic responses from certain non-interface related impedance changes may be greater, but still require improved low frequency seismic sources. ",

In this paper, we provide a theoretical discussion, on the Astigmatic Defocus Sensor, based on Fourier optics. The theoretical discussion is validated through simulation results.

We address the problem of the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) \"per photon\" actually transported by STOVs propagating in free space or non-dispersive media, the most frequent experimental situation. Unlike longitudinal vortices in monochromatic light beams, STOVs do not carry any net transverse OAM about a fixed transverse axis crossing its center. However, STOVs transport an intrinsic transverse OAM per photon about a moving, transverse axis through its center, and an opposite extrinsic transverse OAM. Their applications would thus preclude setting particles at rest into rotation, but STOVs could transmit their intrinsic transverse OAM to photons of other waves. The intrinsic transverse OAM per photon of a circular symmetric STOV of frequency $\\omega_0$ and topological charge $l$ is $l/2\\omega_0$, half the intrinsic longitudinal OAM of a circularly symmetric monochromatic light beam with a vortex of the same topological charge. When STOVs lose their circular, or more generally, elliptical symmetry, upon propagation, they preserve their intrinsic transverse OAM, but its value is no longer related to the topological charges of the singularities, which may disappear or even reverse their sign.

Herein, we employ the many-body Green's function approach (in the GW approximation) to investigate the solvation effects on the ionization energy of phenol in various solvents with distinct polarizability. The many-body effects among the investigated solvents differ by up to 0.4 eV, and this difference is not simply owed to the macroscopic solvent polarizability. Utilizing orbital localization and projection, we define an electronic subspace for a fragment, i.e., a solvation shell, in the solvent environment. The resulting fragment correlation self-energy is shown to decay with respect to the intermolecular distance and vanish at ~9 angstroms. This decaying pattern is independent of the ionization state and the solvent type. The 9-angstrom cut-off distance defines an effective interacting volume, within which we find the quasiparticle energy shift per solvent molecule is directly related to the polarizability of the solvent molecules. Finally, we propose a simple solvation model for computing the quasiparticle energies of solvated systems. ",

The piezoelectric behavior of ZnO nanostructures (especially nanorods or microrods) is getting considerable attention in the fabrications of piezo tactile sensors, energy harvesting devices, and other self-powering implantable devices. Especially vertically aligned ZnO nanorods are of high interest due to their higher value of piezoelectric coefficient along the z-direction. In this report, various geometries and alignments of ZnO nanorods are explored and their effect on strength of piezoelectric output potential has been simulated by COMSOL Multiphysics software. Best suited geometry and inclination are explored in this simulation to achieve high piezoelectric output in haptic and energy harvester devices. The simulation results show out of many geometries and inclinations the highest piezoelectric output is demonstrated by the inclined ZnO nanorods due to the application of higher torque force or shear stress in similar applied force. The high torque force or shear stress at 60 degree orientation and optimized contributions from all the piezoelectric coefficients resulted in a high piezoelectric output potential close to 215 mV which is much higher than the vertically aligned ZnO nanorod which is approximately 25 mV. The results are contrary to the accepted understanding that the vertical ZnO nanorods should produce the highest output voltage due to the high piezoelectric coefficient along the z-axis. ",

We predict and quantify the amount of amplification of the transmitted and reflected pulse and show the amplifications achieve a maximum at the centre of the k-gap accompanied by weaker growth in intensity at the edges. The maximum growth in the intensity of the optical pulses attains different values for different ranges of k-gaps in such systems.

The formation of microcavity intersubband polaritons at frequencies as low as 1.8 THz is demonstrated, with a sustained ultra-strong coupling regime up to a temperature of 200K. It is additionally shown that the ultra-strong coupling regime is preserved when the active region is embedded in sub-wavelength resonators, with an estimated relative strength $\\eta = \\Omega_R / \\omega_0 = 0.12$. This represents an important milestone for future studies of quantum vacuum radiation because such resonators can be optically modulated at ultrafast rates, possibly leading to the generation of non-classical light via the dynamic Casimir effect. Finally, with an effective volume of $2.10^{-6} \\lambda_0^3$, it is estimated that fewer than 3000 electrons per resonator are ultra-strongly coupled to the quantized electromagnetic mode, proving it is also a promising approach to explore few-electron polaritonic systems operating at relatively high temperatures.

In this study, we compared two typical spintronic systems in terms of using spins as qubits: one is a giant spin (molecular nanomagnet) with strong anisotropy due to the spin lattice coupling, the other is a single spin that is weakly bound in an ion. We found that, although both use quantum spin tunnelling, the single spin is much more agile than the giant spin (whose clumsiness is not only due to its giant size but also due to its strong coupling with the surroundings) and can break the Landauer bound (the energy of erasing a classical bit of information). Experimental verification is provided, in which the single spin is optically manipulated by a circularly polarized on-resonant laser (with a wavelength ranging from 422 nm to 1092 nm) and Rabi flopping at mHz. In conclusion, quantum spintronics (with a single spin as a qubit) may represent a new energy efficient computing paradigm within the context that the increase in the computing power efficiency will come to a halt around 2050 due to the Landauer bound.

The quality factor of the SRF resonators can be significantly compromised due to the presence of the trapped flux vortices causing additional RF energy losses in the material. Large number of experiments have been carried out by different research groups to establish the correlation of the flux trapping in niobium cavities with the presence of impurities in niobium as well as various surface treatment methods. Majority of these experiments utilize commercially available cryogenic fluxgate magnetic sensors to measure the field before and after the niobium transition to the superconducting state to quantify the amount of flux trapped. One disadvantage of the typically used fluxgates is the size of the sensing volume. As an example, the Barting-ton F and G type cryogenic fluxgates have a sensing core length of about 30mm, which is comparable to the curvature radius of the cavity walls and hence the magnetic field lines curvature radius after the expulsion. Thus, the measured field value needs to be corrected to account for the sensor effective averaging over the sensing volume. In case of the sharper geometries, for instance if the flux expulsion to be measured on the edge of the rectangular niobium flat sheet with a thickness of ~5mm, the use of the fluxgate would be impractical.

The oil film spreads along the path of the propagating SAW and comes in contact with the drop, which is placed in its path. The intensity of the SAW determines the rate and the extent to which a macroscopically thick film of oil will climb over the drop to partially or fully cover its surface. The dynamic wetting of the drop by the oil film is governed by a balance between acoustic, capillary, and gravitational contributions. Introducing a water drop as an object to be coated indicates the opportunity to coat liquid phase objects by employing SAWs and demonstrates that oil films which are actuated by SAWs may traverse curved objects and liquid surfaces.

We generalize previous research on deterministically implementing the Dicke state to a state preparation algorithm for an ESP state, or equivalently AGP, on a quantum computer. Our method is deterministic and has polynomial cost, and it does not rely on number symmetry breaking and restoration. We also show that our circuit is equivalent to a disentangled unitary paired coupled cluster operator and a layer of unitary Jastrow operator acting on a single Slater determinant. The method presented herein highlights the ability of disentangled unitary coupled cluster to capture non-trivial entanglement properties that are hardly accessible with traditional Hartree-Fock based electronic structure methods.
