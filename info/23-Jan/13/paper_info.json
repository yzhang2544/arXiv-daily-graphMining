Here, we demonstrate the localization of light in an instantaneously reconfigurable non-Hermitian honeycomb photonic lattice that is established in a coherently-prepared atomic system. One set of the sublattices is optically modulated to introduce the absorptive difference between neighboring lattice sites, where the Dirac points in reciprocal space are extended into dispersionless local flat bands. When these local flat bands are broad enough due to larger loss difference, the incident beam is effectively localized at one set of the lattices with weaker absorption, namely, the commonly seen power exchange between adjacent channels in photonic lattices is effectively prohibited. The current work unlocks a new capability from non-Hermitian two-dimensional photonic lattices and provides an alternative route for engineering tunable local flat bands in photonic structures. ",

An intra-cryostat VECSEL focusing cavity design is used to enable continuous-wave lasing with a cavity length over 30 mm which corresponds to a round-trip frequency near 5 GHz. Strong RF current modulation is injected to the QC-metasurface electrical bias to pull and lock the round-trip frequency. The injection locking range at various RF injection powers is recorded and compared with the injection locking theory. Moreover, the lasing spectrum broadens from 14 GHz in free-running mode to a maximum spectral width around 100 GHz with 20 dBm of injected RF power.

Sub-Doppler spectroscopy based on saturable absorption has been carried out to resolve the hyperfine structure of the P(33)6-3 lines at room temperature with a full-width at half maximum of 24MHz on the b4 component with the help of lock-in amplification.

    "abstract": "CO2 injection into a saline aquifer crossed by a tectonic fault is studied with coupled fluid mechanics - geomechanics modeling. The model is based on reservoir simulator MUFITS and mechanical simulator FLAC3D linked by the in-house algorithm of the data exchange. MUFITS simulates the non-isothermal multiphase flow of CO2 and brine in rock formation accounting for phase transitions and thermal effects. The modeling workflow is sequential, so that hydrodynamical simulations are carried out at a certain time interval, after which pressure, temperature, and density distributions are passed to FLAC3D, which calculates the equilibrium mechanical state. Computed deformations and stresses are utilized to update the porosity and permeability fields for the subsequent hydrodynamic modeling. In particular, we focus on the tectonic fault and its behavior during CO2 injection. We distinguish the damage zone and core inside the fault and derive the closure relations for their permeability alteration analytically. The developed coupled approach is applied to simulate CO2 injection into synthetic and realistic reservoir models. For the former one, we study the effect of formation depth and presence of the tectonic stresses at the initial mechanical state, while for the latter, we consider different injection modes (bottomhole pressure). In each numerical experiment, we describe the evolution of the fault permeability due to the slip along its plane and the development of plastic deformations leading to the loss of reservoir integrity and CO2 leakage. Sensitivity analysis of the coupled model to realistic values of input parameters to assess the fault stability is carried out. ",

Here we show for the first time that electromagnetic Mie-scattering moments within SiC metasurfaces can control the spontaneous emission process of point defects in the near infrared. Using SiC nanopillars based metasurfaces, we theoretically demonstrate a control over the spontaneous emission rate of embedded color-centers by using the coherent superposition of the electric dipolar and magnetic quadrupolar electromagnetic Mie-scattering moments of the structure. More than an order of magnitude emission/decay rate enhancement is obtained with the maximum enhancement close to 30. We also demonstrate that the relative phase of the Mie-scattering moments helps in controlling the emission directionality. SiC metasurfaces in the spectral range of color centres, from the visible to the near infrared, can be used to control the confinement and directionality of their spontaneous emission, increasing the opportunities to study light-matter interaction and to advance quantum photonic and quantum sensing device integration.

This method combines the adaptive HOPS (adHOPS) framework, which uses locality to improve computational scaling, with the dyadic HOPS method previously developed to calculate linear and non-linear spectroscopic signals. To construct a local representation of dyadic HOPS, we introduce an initial state decomposition which reconstructs the linear absorption spectra from a sum over locally excited initial conditions. We demonstrate the sum over initial conditions can be efficiently Monte Carlo sampled, that the corresponding calculations achieve size-invariant (i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(1)$) scaling for sufficiently large aggregates, and that it allows for the trivial inclusion of static disorder in the Hamiltonian. We present calculations on the photosystem I core complex to explore the behavior of the initial state decomposition in complex molecular aggregates, and proof-of-concept DadHOPS calculations on an artificial molecular aggregate inspired by perylene bis-imide.

However, spin configuration and flipping requires two independent sets of spatial light modulators (SLMs) for amplitude and phase modulation, which will lead to tremendous engineering difficulty of optical alignment and coupling. We report a novel quadrature photonic spatial-Euler Ising machine to realize large-scale and flexible spin-interaction configuration and spin-flip in a single spatial light modulator, and develop a noise enhancement approach by adding digital white noise onto detected optical signals. We experimentally show that such proposal accelerates solving (un)weighted, (non)fully connected, 20736-node Max-cut problems, which offers obvious advantages over simulation and heuristic algorithm results in digital computers.

We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of \"magnetic\" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of \"electric\" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases.

Strong polarization gradients near the tweezer focus lead to qubit-state dependent forces on the ion. We show that these may be used to implement quantum logic gates on pairs of ion qubits in a crystal. The qubit-state dependent forces generated by this effect live on the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the laser beams opening new ways of coupling to motional modes of an ion crystal. The proposed gate does not require ground state cooling of the ions and does not rely on the Lamb-Dicke approximation, although the waist of the tightly focused beam needs to be comparable with its wavelength in order to achieve the needed field curvature. Furthermore, the gate can be performed on both ground state and magnetic field insensitive clock state qubits without the need for counter-propagating laser fields. This simplifies the setup and eliminates errors due to phase instabilities between the gate laser beams. Finally, we show that imperfections in the gate execution, in particular pointing errors $<30$ nm in the tweezers reduce the gate fidelity from $\\mathcal F\\gtrsim 0.99998$ to $\\gtrsim 0.999$. ",

In this endeavor, here we propose to interface Rubidium atoms with a photonic crystal waveguide based on a large-index GaInP slab. With a specifically tailored half-W1 design, we show that a large coupling to the waveguide can be obtained and guided modes can be used to form two-color dipole traps for atoms at about 100 nm from the edge of the structure.

Liquids induce electronic polarization and drive electric currents as they flow; electronic excitations, in turn, participate in hydrodynamic friction. Yet, the underlying solid-liquid interactions have been lacking a direct experimental probe. Here, we study the energy transfer across liquid-graphene interfaces using ultrafast spectroscopy. The graphene electrons are heated up quasi-instantaneously by a visible excitation pulse, and the time evolution of the electronic temperature is then monitored with a terahertz pulse. We observe that water accelerates the cooling of the graphene electrons, whereas other polar liquids leave the cooling dynamics largely unaffected. A quantum theory of solid-liquid heat transfer accounts for the water-specific cooling enhancement through a resonance between the graphene surface plasmon mode and the so-called hydrons -- water charge fluctuations --, particularly the water libration modes, that allows for efficient energy transfer. Our results provide direct experimental evidence of a solid-liquid interaction mediated by collective modes and support the theoretically proposed mechanism for quantum friction. They further reveal a particularly large thermal boundary conductance for the water-graphene interface and suggest strategies for enhancing the thermal conductivity in graphene-based nanostructures.

While experimental measurements of the phonon-assisted absorption coefficient of SiC across its indirect gap have existed for more than fifty years, theoretical investigations of phonon-assisted absorption have been hampered by their excessive computational cost. In this work, we calculate the phonon-assisted temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra of the commonly occurring SiC polytypes (3C, 2H, 4H and 6H), using first-principles approaches based on density functional theory and related techniques. We show that our results agree with experimentally determined absorption coefficients in the spectral region between the direct and indirect band gaps. The temperature dependence of the spectra can be well-predicted with taking the temperature-dependence of the band gaps into account. Lastly, we compare the spectra obtained with second-order perturbation theory to those determined by the special displacement method, and we show that the full consideration of the electronic energy renormalization due to temperature is important to further improve the prediction of the phonon-assisted absorption in SiC. Our insights can be applied to predict the optical spectra of the less common SiC polytypes and other indirect-gap semiconductors in general. ",
