It is shown that the results of the paper are easily obtained in a classical approach, so that no quantum effect has to be invoked.

We optimize a degenerate cavity to have many spatial modes lasing simultaneously with different frequencies. Their spatio-temporal beating creates ultrafast random intensity fluctuations, which are spatially demultiplexed to generate hundreds of uncorrelated time traces for parallel ranging. The bandwidth of each channel exceeds 10 GHz, leading to a ranging resolution better than 1 cm. Our parallel random LiDAR is robust to cross-channel interference, and will facilitate high-speed 3D sensing and imaging. ",

    "abstract": "We examine the effects of a massive concentric ring around a spheroid or an ellipsoid with uniform density and uniform rotation. Equilibrium sequences of axisymmetric Maclaurin-like spheroid and triaxial Jacobi-like ellipsoids are obtained. Due to the gravitational field of the ring, Maclaurin-like spheroid does not have a spherical limit when the object's angular frequency vanishes. At a critical value of the eccentricity of the spheroid's meridional section, a triaxial Jacobi-like ellipsoid bifurcates. When a parameter characterizing the gravitational field of the ring is smaller than a threshold, the bifurcation points of Maclaurin-like and Jacobi-like ellipsoids exist and the critical eccentricity is slightly larger than that of the classical Maclaurin-to-Jacobi bifurcation. When the parameter exceeds the threshold, the Maclaurin-like spheroid does not have the bifurcation point and the Jacobi-like ellipsoid appears at the lower eccentricity than the Maclaurin-like spheroid. By comparisons of the energy of the ellipsoids with the same angular momentum, it is shown that the critical point of bifurcation does not correspond to the onset of the secular instability of Maclaurin-like spheroid. It is concluded that the gravitational field of a massive ring surrounding a uniformly rotating spheroid stabilizes it against a bar-shaped deformation due to viscous dissipations. ",

We employ theory, numerical simulation and experiments to design and interpret this collimated beaming phenomenon and use a crystal consisting of a finite rectangular cuboid array of $4\\times 10\\times 10$ polymer spheres $1.38$~cm in diameter in air, arranged in a primitive cubic cell with the centre-to-centre spacing of the spheres, i.e. the pitch, as $1.5$~cm. Collimation effects are observed in the time domain for chirps with central frequencies at $14.2$~kHz and $18$~kHz, and we deployed a laser feedback interferometer or Self-Mixing Interferometer (SMI) -- a recently proposed technique to observe complex acoustic fields -- that enables experimental visualisation of the pressure field both within the crystal and outside of the crystal. Numerical exploration using a higher-order multi-scale finite element method designed for the rapid and detailed simulation of 3D wave physics further confirms these collimation effects and cross-validates with the experiments. Interpretation follows using High Frequency Homogenization and Bloch analysis whereby the different origin of the collimation at these two frequencies is revealed by markedly different isofrequency surfaces of the sonic crystal.

For instance, convolutional neural networks lend themselves to analog optical implementations by exploiting the Fourier-transform characteristics of suitable designed optical setups. However, the efficient implementation of optical nonlinearities for such neural networks still represents challenges. In this work, we report on the realization and characterization of a three-layer optical convolutional neural network where the linear part is based on a 4f-imaging system and the optical nonlinearity is realized via the absorption profile of a cesium atomic vapor cell. This system classifies the handwritten digital dataset MNIST with 83.96% accuracy, which agrees well with corresponding simulations. Our results thus demonstrate the viability of utilizing atomic nonlinearities in neural network architectures with low power consumption. ",

    "abstract": "The study of isolated defects in solids is a natural target for classical or quantum embedding methods that treat the defect at a high level of theory and the rest of the solid at a lower level of theory. Here, in the context of active-space-based quantum embeddings, we study the performance of three active-space orbital selection schemes based on canonical (energy-ordered) orbitals, local orbitals defined in the spirit of density matrix embedding theory, and approximate natural transition orbitals. Using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD), we apply these active space selection schemes to the calculation of the vertical singlet excitation energy of a substitutional carbon dimer defect in hexagonal boron nitride, an oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide, and a carbon vacancy in diamond. Especially when used in combination with a simple composite correction, we find that the best performing schemes can predict the excitation energy to about 0.1-0.2 eV of its converged value using only a few hundred orbitals, even when the full supercell has thousands of orbitals, which amounts to many-orders-of-magnitude computational savings when using correlated electronic structure theories. When compared to assigned experimental spectra and accounting for vibrational corrections, we find that CCSD predicts excitation energies that are accurate to about 0.1-0.3 eV, which is comparable to its performance in molecules and bulk solids.

While several non-Gaussian states have been generated experimentally, none have been created using ultrashort optical wave packets, which are necessary for high-speed quantum computation, in the telecommunication wavelength band where mature optical communication technology is available. In this paper, we present the generation of non-Gaussian states on wave packets with a short 8-ps duration in the 1545.32 nm telecommunication wavelength band using photon subtraction up to three photons. We used a low-loss, quasi-single spatial mode waveguide optical parametric amplifier, a superconducting transition edge sensor, and a phase-locked pulsed homodyne measurement system to observe negative values of the Wigner function without loss correction up to three-photon subtraction. These results can be extended to the generation of more complicated non-Gaussian states and are a key technology in the pursuit of high-speed optical quantum computation. ",

Here, we present a scheme for retrieving the quantum surface response of metals encapsulated in the Feibelman $d$-parameters from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. We theoretically demonstrate that quantum nonlocal effects have a dramatic impact on EELS and CL spectra, in the guise of spectral shifts and nonlocal damping, when either the system size or the inverse wave vector in extended structures approach the nanometer scale. Our concept capitalizes on the unparalleled ability of free-electrons to supply tailored, deeply subwavelength near-fields and, thus, probe the optical response of metals at length scales in which quantum-mechanical effects are apparent. These results pave the way for a widespread use of the $d$-parameter formalism, thereby facilitating a rigorous yet practical inclusion of nonclassical effects in nanoplasmonics studies. ",

In this work, we apply this concept of intensity interferometry to holography. We combine a signal beam with a reference and measure their intensity cross-correlations using a time-tagging single-photon camera. These correlations reveal an interference pattern from which we reconstruct the signal wavefront in both intensity and phase. We demonstrate the principle with classical and quantum light, including a single photon. Since the signal and reference do not need to be phase-stable, this technique can be used to generate holograms of self-luminous or remote objects using a local reference, thus opening the door to new holography applications.

    "abstract": "Delay line oscillators based on photonic components, such as the optoelectronic oscillator (OEO), offer the potential for realization of phase noise levels orders of magnitude lower than achievable by conventional microwave sources. Fibre optic-based delay lines can realize the large delay required for low phase noise systems whilst simultaneously achieving insertion loss levels that can be compensated by available microwave and photonic amplification technologies. However, the long fibre is vulnerable to environmental perturbations such as mechanical vibrations and variations in ambient temperature, which result in short term fluctuations and thermally induced drift of the oscillation frequency. The phase shifter used conventionally to adjust the frequency of an OEO to enable phase lock has a finite range that is insufficient to compensate the delay change resulting from operational temperature ranges. A solution to continuous tuning without mode-hopping and to compensation of thermally induced frequency drift without loss of lock of a time delay oscillator is proposed. The basic concept is to introduce a tuning mechanism that works with Cartesian co-ordinates on the complex plane and to avoid explicit use of polar co-ordinates. Consequently, the transmission of the tuning component may traverse the unit circle in either direction multiple times without range limitation to the phase. Thereby tuning by mode-hopping is avoided and expedients to stabilisation, such as the use of tunable lasers within a control loop or precision temperature stabilisation measures are not required. The concept is verified by Simulink simulations. The method has been experimentally tested successfully using a prototype OEO phase locked to a system reference. Solid lock was maintained even when the OEO was placed in an oven and cycled over a temperature range from ambient to 80 {\\deg}C. ",

However, the real-time processing of large-scale EEG signals at high energy efficiency has placed great challenges for electronic processors on edge computing devices. Here, we propose the EEG opto-processor based on diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to effectively process the extracranial and intracranial EEG signals and perform epileptic seizure detection. The signals of EEG channels within a second-time window are optically encoded as inputs to the constructed diffractive neural networks for classification, which monitors the brain state to determine whether it's the symptom of an epileptic seizure or not. We developed both the free-space and integrated DPUs as edge computing systems and demonstrated their applications for real-time epileptic seizure detection with the benchmark datasets, i.e., the CHB-MIT extracranial EEG dataset and Epilepsy-iEEG-Multicenter intracranial EEG dataset, at high computing performance. Along with the channel selection mechanism, both the numerical evaluations and experimental results validated the sufficient high classification accuracies of the proposed opto-processors for supervising the clinical diagnosis. Our work opens up a new research direction of utilizing photonic computing techniques for processing large-scale EEG signals in promoting its broader applications. ",
