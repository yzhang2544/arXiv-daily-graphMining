    "abstract": "We measure nonlocal third-order spatial correlations in non-degenerate ultracold gases of bosonic ($^{84}$Sr) and spin-polarized fermionic ($^{87}$Sr) strontium through studies of the formation rates for ultralong-range trimer Rydberg molecules. The trimer production rate is observed to be very sensitive to the effects of quantum statistics with a strong enhancement of up to a factor of six (3!) in the case of bosonic $^{84}$Sr due to bunching, and a marked reduction for spin-polarized fermionic $^{87}$Sr due to anti-bunching. The experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions and good agreement is observed. The present approach opens the way to {\\it{in situ}} studies of higher-order nonlocal spatial correlations in a wide array of ultracold atomic-gas systems. ",

    "title": "Additive 3D photonic integration that is CMOS compatible",
    "abstract": "Today, continued miniaturization in electronic integrated circuits (ICs) appears to have reached its fundamental limit. At the same time, energy consumption due by communication becomes the dominant limitation in high performance electronic ICs for computing, and modern computing concepts such a neural networks further amplify the challenge. Photonic communication is a promising strategy to address the second, while adding a third dimension to the predominantly two dimensional integrated circuits appears the most promising future strategy for further IC architecture improvement. Crucial for efficient electronic-photonic co-integration is CMOS compatibility. Here, we review our latest results obtained in the FEMTO-ST RENATECH facilities on using additive photo-induced polymerization of a standard photo-resin for truly 3D photonic integration according to these principles. Based on one- and two-photon polymerization and combined with direct-laser writing, we 3D-printed air- and polymer-cladded photonic waveguides. An important application of such circuits are the interconnects of optical neural networks, where 3D integration enables scalability in terms of network size versus its geometric dimensions. In particular via \\emph{flash}-TPP, a fabrication process combining blanket one- and high-resolution two-photon polymerization, we demonstrated polymer-cladded step-index waveguides with up to 6~mm length, low insertion ($\\sim$0.26~dB) and propagation ($\\sim$1.3~dB/mm) losses, realized broadband and low loss ($\\sim$0.06~dB splitting losses) adiabatic 1 to M couplers as well as tightly confining air-cladded waveguides for denser integration. By stably printing such integrated photonic circuits on standard semiconductor samples, we show the concept's CMOS compatibility. With this, we lay out a promising, future avenue for scalable integration of hybrid photonic and electronic components. ",

    "title": "Reconfigurable microresonators induced in side-coupled optical fibers",
    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate that side-coupling of coplanar bent optical fibers can induce a high Q-factor whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical microresonator. To explain the effect, we consider WGMs with wavelengths close to the cutoff wavelengths (CWs) of these fibers which slowly propagate along the fiber axes. In the vicinity of the touching region, WGMs of adjacent fibers are coupled to each other, and CWs experience sub-nanoscale axial variation proportional to the coupling strength. We show that in certain cases the CW variation leads to full localization of the WGMs and the creation of an optical microresonator. By varying the characteristic curvature fiber radius from the centimeter order to millimeter order, we demonstrate fully mechanically reconfigurable high Q-factor optical microresonators with dimensions varying from the millimeter order to 100-micron order and free spectral range varying from a picometer to hundreds of picometers. The new microresonators may find applications in cavity QED, microresonator optomechanics, frequency comb generation with tunable repetition rate, tunable lasing, and tunable processing and delay of optical pulses.

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms for simulating electronic ground states are slower than popular classical mean-field algorithms such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, but offer higher accuracy. Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree-Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the $k$-particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage. ",
