    "abstract": "Transfer of information between topological edge states is a robust way of spatially manipulating quantum states while preserving their coherence in lattice environments. This method is particularly efficient when the edge modes are kept within the topological gap of the lattice during the transfer. In this work we show experimentally the transfer of photonic modes between topological edge states located at opposite ends of a dimerized one-dimensional photonic lattice. We use a diamond lattice of coupled waveguides and show that the transfer is insensitive both to the presence of a high density of states in the form of a flat band at an energy close to that of the edge states, and to the presence of disorder in the hoppings. We explore dynamics in the waveguide lattice using wavelength-scan method, where different input wavelength translates into different effective waveguide length. These results open the way to the implementation of more efficient protocols based on the active driving of the hoppings. ",

In this work, we present detailed photophysical analysis of hBN single emitters emitting at the blue spectral range. The emitters are fabricated by different electron beam irradiation and annealing conditions and exhibit narrow-band luminescence centred at 436 nm. Photon statistics as well as rigorous photodynamics analysis unveils potential level structure of the emitters, which suggests lack of a metastable state, supported by a theoretical analysis. The potential defect can have an electronic structure with fully occupied defect state in the lower half of the hBN band gap and empty defect state in the upper half of the band gap. Overall, our results are important to understand the photophysical properties of the emerging family of blue quantum emitters in hBN as potential sources for scalable quantum photonic applications.

    "abstract": "In this article, a thorough characterization of the configuration composed by two concentric jets at a low Reynolds number is presented. The analysis comprises a layout with a wide range for the velocity ratio between the inner and outer jets, defined within the interval [0, 2], and also details the influence of the distance between jets, where the wall thicknesses separating the two jets is [0.5, 4]. Global linear stability analysis identifies the most significant modes driving the changes in the flow dynamics. The neutral lines revealing the critical Reynolds number connected to the presence of the main (steady and unsteady) flow bifurcations, which are presented by global azimuthal modes, show the high complexity of the problem under study, where hysteresis and other types of complex cycles are pointed out. Finally, the mode interaction is analysed, highlighting the presence of travelling waves emerging from the interaction of steady states, and the existence of robust heteroclinic cycles that are asymptotically stable. The high level of detail in the results presented, makes this work as a reference for future research development in the field of concentric jets. ",

The laser-induced plasmas are promising mediums for generating THz radiation. It has been recently reported that focusing femtosecond Bessel pulses inside dielectrics induces a high aspect ratio over-critical plasmas. Here we show that the intense resonantly driven electrostatic fields at the so-called critical surface lead to THz radiation emission. Through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation and analytical derivation, we have investigated the emission of THz radiation. We show that the THz radiation is associated with a hot population of electrons trapped in ambipolar electric fields of the double layers. ",

    "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires a transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy. As a result, power generation becomes more volatile and options for microgrids and islanded power-grid operation are being broadly discussed. Therefore, studying the power grids of physical islands, as a model for islanded microgrids, is of particular interest when it comes to enhancing our understanding of power-grid stability. In the present paper, we investigate the statistical properties of the power-grid frequency of three island systems: Iceland, Ireland, and the Balearic Islands. We utilise a Fokker-Planck approach to construct stochastic differential equations that describe market activities, control, and noise acting on power-grid dynamics. Using the obtained parameters we create synthetic time series of the frequency dynamics. Our main contribution is to propose two extensions of stochastic power-grid frequency models and showcase the applicability of these new models to non-Gaussian statistics, as encountered in islands.

    "abstract": "There has been a very recent surge in the interest on the localization properties of resonances associated to partially open (scattering) systems, which are of the greatest relevance when studying resonant cavities like those used in microlasers for example. Very recently it has been found that no localization is present in a scaled form of these states. Moreover, a new kind of scarring on structures different from periodic orbits is described for non normalized resonances. In this paper, we analyze the localization of a scaled distribution function based on the quantum repeller representation for the partially open quantum tribaker map, a paradigmatic system. We find localization, which in the generic case can be associated to the shortest periodic orbits in non trivial ways. Also, normalized states present enhancements that could not be conclusively associated to periodic orbits and that become more evident when looking at the repeller. These findings leave the door open for new perspectives on recent theoretical developments. ",

    "title": "An accordion superlattice for controlling atom separation in optical  potentials",
    "abstract": "We propose a method for separating trapped atoms in optical lattices by large distances. The key idea is the cyclic transfer of atoms between two lattices of variable spacing, known as accordion lattices, each covering at least a factor of two in lattice spacing. By coherently loading atoms between the two superimposed potentials, we can reach, in principle, arbitrarily large atom separations, while requiring only a relatively small numerical aperture. Numerical simulations of our `accordion superlattice' show that the atoms remain localised to one lattice site throughout the separation process, even for moderate lattice depths. In a proof-of-principle experiment we demonstrate the optical fields required for the accordion superlattice using acousto-optic deflectors. The method can be applied to neutral-atom quantum computing with optical tweezers, as well as quantum simulation of low-entropy many-body states. For instance, a unit-filling atomic Mott insulator can be coherently expanded by a factor of ten in order to load an optical tweezer array with very high filling. In turn, sorted tweezer arrays can be compressed to form high-density states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The method can be also be applied to biological systems where dynamical separation of particles is required. ",

    "abstract": "Optical lattices are the basic blocks of atomic quantum technology. The scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. Tight confinement of single sites in conventional lattices requires excessive laser intensity which in turn suppresses the coherence due to enhanced scattering. This article proposes a new scheme for atomic optical lattice with sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is formed by the nonlinear optical response of the three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which is not constrained by the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The lattice consists of a 3D array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells with sub-nanometer widths. The scheme allows moving adjacent sites to close distances with sub-nanometer resolution. These extreme scales are now optically accessible by a hybrid scheme deploying the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The Lorentzian trapping potentials with 2\\AA width and 30MHz depth are realizable with scattering rates as low as 1Hz. The mentioned improvements allow quantum logic operations with Rydberg-Fermi interaction. These techniques are particularly demanding for the realization of atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation. ",

These sequences beget ordered quantum walks and yield MESPS with periods 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15. For the first time, we reveal single coins such as Hadamard, which can generate periodic MESPS (with periods 4 and 12) on $4$ and $8$-cycles.
