    "title": "Diagnosis of ultrafast ultraintense laser pulse characteristics by  machine-learning-assisted electron spin",
    "abstract": "Rapid development of ultrafast ultraintense laser technologies continues to create opportunities for studying strong-field physics under extreme conditions. However, accurate determination of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a laser pulse is still a great challenge, especially when laser powers higher than hundreds of terawatts are involved. In this paper, by utilizing the radiative spin-flip effect, we find that the spin depolarization of an electron beam can be employed to diagnose characteristics of ultrafast ultraintense lasers with peak intensities around $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$~W/cm$^2$. With three shots, our machine-learning-assisted model can predict, simultaneously, the pulse duration, peak intensity, and focal radius of a focused Gaussian ultrafast ultraintense laser (in principle, the profile can be arbitrary) with relative errors of $0.1\\%$-$10\\%$. The underlying physics and an alternative diagnosis method (without the assistance of machine learning) are revealed by the asymptotic approximation of the final spin degree of polarization. Our proposed scheme exhibits robustness and detection accuracy with respect to fluctuations in the electron beam parameters. Accurate measurements of the ultrafast ultraintense laser parameters will lead to much higher precision in, for example, laser nuclear physics investigations and laboratory astrophysics studies. Robust machine learning techniques may also find applications in more general strong-field physics scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique benefits from high magnetic field not only due to the field-enhanced measurement sensitivity and resolution, but also because it is a powerful tool to investigate field-induced physics in modern material science. In this study, we successfully performed NMR measurements in high flat-top pulsed magnetic field (FTPMF) up to 40 T. A two-stage corrected FTPMF with fluctuation less than 10 mT and duration longer than 9 ms was established. Besides, a Giga-Hz NMR spectrometer and a sample probe suitable for pulsed-field condition were developed. Both free-induction-decay and spin-echo protocols were exploited for the measurements. The derived $^{93}$Nb NMR results show that the stability and homogeneity of the FTPMF reach an order of 10$^2$ ppm / 10 ms and 10$^2$ ppm / 10 mm$^3$ respectively, which is approaching a degree of maturity for some researches on condensed matter physics.

    "abstract": "We describe the development of a course of quantum mechanics for secondary school designed to address the challenges related to the revision of classical knowledge, to the building of a well-organized knowledge structure on the discipline, and to the development of a plausible and reliable picture of the quantum world. The course is based on a coordinated application of an analysis of conceptual change in the learning of a successive theory, of a framework describing the epistemic practices of theoretical physicists, and of a careful approach to interpretive themes. We show how they drive the derivation of the design principles, how these principles guide the development of the instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their implementation requires the blending of different research perspectives and learning systems. The first challenge is addressed through a path of revision of classical concepts and constructs which leverages student resources according to the trajectory of each notion. The second by adopting a framework that promotes the construction of a unifying picture of quantum measurement across contexts. The third by designing the course around a modeling process that engages students in epistemic practices of the theoretical physicist, such as generating and/or running thought experiments, and mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical setting. All is aimed to help students accept the quantum description of the world as a plausible product of their own inquiry. This process is assisted by the discussion of the facets of the foundational debate that are triggered by each of our interpretive choices. Data on the cycles of refinement are used to illustrate the coherence between the principles and the activities designed to implement them, as well as the process by which the revision of the activities contributed to shape the initial guidelines.

These two cases are identified as electron currents and hole currents, respectively, and up to now they have been studied only separately. We report \\textit{ab initio} time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) simulations of currents during resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization of benzene, which reveal for the first time that both electron and hole currents can be present simultaneously. By adjusting the intensity of the laser pulse, the balance between the two types of current can be controlled, and the overall sign of the current can be switched. We provide a physical explanation for the effect in terms of complex molecular orbitals which is consistent with the TDDFT simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Disordered media coatings are finding increasing use in applications such as day-time radiative cooling paints and solar thermal absorber plate coatings which require tailored optical properties over a broad spectrum ranging from visible to far-IR wavelengths. Both monodisperse and polydisperse configurations with thickness of coatings up to 500 micrometer are currently being explored for use in these applications. In such cases it becomes increasingly important to explore utility of analytical and semi-analytical methods for design of such coatings to help reduce the computational cost and time for design. While well-known analytical methods such as Kubelka-Munk and four-flux theory have previously been used for analysis of disordered coatings, analysis of their utility has so far in literature been restricted to either solar spectrum or IR but not simultaneously over the combined spectrum as required for the above applications. In this work, we have analysed the applicability of these two analytical methods for such coatings over the entire wavelength range from visible to IR, and based on observed deviation from exact numerical simulation we propose a semi-analytical technique to aid in the design of these coatings with significant computational cost savings.

    "title": "Non-volatile electrically programmable integrated photonics with a 5-bit  operation",
    "abstract": "Scalable programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can potentially transform the current state of classical and quantum optical information processing. However, traditional means of programming, including thermo-optic, free carrier dispersion, and Pockels effect result in either large device footprints or high static energy consumptions, significantly limiting their scalability. While chalcogenide-based non-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) could mitigate these problems thanks to their strong index modulation and zero static power consumption, they often suffer from large absorptive loss, low cyclability, and lack of multilevel operation. Here, we report a wide-bandgap PCM antimony sulfide (Sb2S3)-clad silicon photonic platform simultaneously achieving low loss, high cyclability, and 5-bit operation. We switch Sb2S3 via an on-chip silicon PIN diode heater and demonstrate components with low insertion loss (<1.0 dB), high extinction ratio (>10 dB), and high endurance (>1,600 switching events). Remarkably, we find that Sb2S3 can be programmed into fine intermediate states by applying identical and thermally isolated pulses, providing a unique approach to controllable multilevel operation. Through dynamic pulse control, we achieve on-demand and accurate 5-bit (32 levels) operations, rendering 0.50 +- 0.16 dB contrast per step. Using this multilevel behavior, we further trim random phase error in a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our work opens an attractive pathway toward non-volatile large-scale programmable PICs with low-loss and on-demand multi-bit operations. ",

    "abstract": "An outstanding challenge in chemical computation is the many-electron problem where computational methodologies scale prohibitively with system size. The energy of any molecule can be expressed as a weighted sum of the energies of two-electron wave functions that are computable from only a two-electron calculation. Despite the physical elegance of this extended ``aufbau'' principle, the determination of the distribution of weights -- geminal occupations -- for general molecular systems has remained elusive. Here we introduce a new paradigm for electronic structure where approximate geminal-occupation distributions are ``learned'' via a convolutional neural network. We show that the neural network learns the $N$-representability conditions, constraints on the distribution for it to represent an $N$-electron system. By training on hydrocarbon isomers with only 2-7 carbon atoms, we are able to predict the energies for isomers of octane as well as hydrocarbons with 8-15 carbons. The present work demonstrates that machine learning can be used to reduce the many-electron problem to an effective two-electron problem, opening new opportunities for accurately predicting electronic structure.

Widely used approaches include mechanical scanning with antenna apertures and phase switching in arrays. Both of those realizations have severe limitations, related to scanning speeds and implementation costs. Here we demonstrate a solution, where the antenna pattern is switched with optical signals. The system encompasses an active element, surrounded by a set of cylindrically arranged passive dipolar directors, functionalized with tunable impedances. The control circuit is realized as a bipolar transistor, driven by a photodiode. Light illumination in this case serves as a trigger, capable of either closing or opening the transistor, switching the impedance between two values. Following this approach, a compact half-a-wavelength footprint antenna, capable to switch between 6 dBi directional patterns within a few milliseconds latency was demonstrated. The developed light activation approach allows constructing devices with multiple almost non-interacting degrees of freedom, as brunched feeding network is not required. The capability of MHz and faster switching between multiple electromagnetic degrees of freedom open pathways to new wireless applications, where fast beam steering and beamforming performances are required.

To deal with statistically obtained data more efficiently, we further develop a bootstrap-averaged analytic continuation method. In the test using the exact imaginary-frequency Green's function with added statistical error, our method produces the spectral function that converges systematically to the exact one as the statistical error decreases. As an application, we simulate the two-orbital Hubbard model for various electron numbers with the dynamical-mean field theory in the imaginary time and obtain the real-frequency self-energy with our analytic continuation method, clearly identifying a non-Fermi liquid behavior as the electron number approaches the half filling from the quarter filling. Our analytic continuation can be used widely and it will facilitate drawing clear conclusions from imaginary-time quantum many-body calculations. ",

While most of the successful proposed schemes for error mitigation are perturbative in the noise and assume deterministic systematic errors, studies of the problem considering the full noise and errors distribution are still scarce. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation scheme for robust single-qubit unitary gates based on composite segmented design, which accounts for the full distribution of the physical noise and errors in the system. We provide two optimization approaches to construct these robust segmented gates: perturbative and non-perturbative, that addresses all orders of errors. We demonstrate our scheme in the photonics realm for the dual-rail directional couplers realization. We show that the 3-segmented composite design for the fundamental single-qubits unitary operations reduces the error by an order of magnitude for a realistic distribution of errors, and that the two approaches are compatible for small errors. This is shown to significantly reduce the overhead of modern error correction codes. Our methods are rather general and can be applied to other realizations of quantum information processing units.

These higher order terms destabilise the dispersive shock wave solution, also termed an undular bore in fluid dynamics, and result in the emission of resonant radiation. In broad terms, there are three possible dispersive shock wave regimes: radiating dispersive shock wave (RDSW), cross-over dispersive shock wave (CDSW) and travelling dispersive shock wave (TDSW). While there are existing solutions for the RDSW and TDSW regimes obtained using modulation theory, there is no existing solution for the CDSW regime. Modulation theory and the associated concept of a Whitham shock are used to obtain this CDSW solution. In addition, it is found that the resonant wavetrain emitted by the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation with water wave coefficients has a minimal amplitude. This minimal amplitude is explained based on the developed Whitham modulation theory. ",
