    "abstract": "This article aims to reconsider E. Schr\\\"odinger's famous thought experiment, the cat paradox experiment, and its place in quantum foundations from a new perspective, grounded in the type of interpretation of quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics, which belongs to the class of interpretations designated here as \"reality without realism\" (RWR) interpretations. Such interpretations have not been previously brought to bear on the cat experiment, including by N. Bohr, whose interpretation in its ultimate forms (as he changes his interpretation a few times) is an RWR interpretation, but who does not appear to have commented on the cat experiment. The interpretation adopted in this articles follows Bohr's interpretation, as based on two assumptions or postulates, the Heisenberg and Bohr postulates, but it adds a third postulate, the Dirac postulate. The article also introduces, in conjunction with the concept of reality without realism, the concepts of visible and invisible to thought and considers their role in the cat-paradox experiment. ",

    "abstract": "Collagen crosslinking of the cornea (CXL) is commonly employed to prevent or treat keratoconus. Although the global change of stiffness before and after treatment can be monitored with OCE, the depth dependence of this change is still unclear. Here we propose to combine phase-decorrelation measurement applied to OCT structural images and acoustic micro-tapping optical coherence elastography (A$\\mu$T-OCE) to explore possible reconstruction of stiffness with depth within crosslinked corneas in an ex vivo human cornea sample. The analysis of experimental OCT images allows to define the penetration depth of CXL into the cornea which varies from $\\sim$100$\\mu m$ in the periphery to $\\sim$150$\\mu m$ in the central area and demonstrates a sharp transition between the areas. This information was used in numerical simulations of the mechanical guided wave propagation in the two-layer medium with different elastic moduli corresponding to that for the CXL and normal corneas. The simulation supports our hypothesis that \"averaged\" elastic moduli can be reconstructed from guided wave propagation in the cornea with partial penetration of CXL, which may then be used to decouple the moduli in each layer. However, additional studies are required to define and characterize the reconstruction algorithm for the more general case of arbitrary CXL penetration depth and its possible variation over the cornea.

One data set was generated with the SB model which is a two-level quantum system coupled to a harmonic environment using HEOM for 1,000 model parameters. Seven data sets were collected for the FMO complex of different sizes(7- and 8-site monomer and 24-site trimer with LTLME and 8-site monomer with HEOM) for 500--879 model parameters.

    "title": "Polarization-independent second-order photonic topological corner states",
    "abstract": "Recently, much attention has been paid to second-order photonic topological insulators (SPTIs), because of their support for highly localized corner states with excellent robustness. SPTIs have been implemented in either transverse magnetic (TM) or transverse electric (TE) polarizations in two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals (PCs), and the resultant topological corner states are polarization-dependent, which limits their application in polarization-independent optics. However, to achieve polarization-independent corner states is not easy, since they are usually in-gap and the exact location in the topological bandgap is not known in advance. Here, we report on a SPTI based on a 2D square-lattice PC made of an elliptic metamaterial, and whether the bandgap is topological or trivial depends on the choice of the unit cell. It is found that locations of topological bandgaps of TM and TE polarizations in the frequency spectrum can be independently controlled by the out-of-plane permittivity $\\varepsilon_\\perp$ and in-plane permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\varparallel}$, respectively, and more importantly, the location of in-gap corner states can also be separately manipulated by them. From this, we achieve topological corner states for both TM and TE polarizations with the same frequency in the PC by adjusting $\\varepsilon_\\perp$ and $\\varepsilon_\\varparallel$, and their robustness against disorders and defects are numerically demonstrated. The proposed SPTI provides a potential application scenario for polarization-independent topological photonic devices. ",

The ability to calculate the effective Hamiltonian allows for the study of scattering problems in infinite systems without the introduction of any artificial truncating boundaries such as perfectly matched layers or Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) maps. Furthermore, the AGF formalism also allows for the efficient calculation of the Green's function of the scatterer as well as all relevant scattering metrics including reflection and transmission ratios. The formalism presented here is especially suited to scattering problems involving waveguides, phononic crystals, metamaterials, and metasurfaces. We show the application of the method to three scattering problems: scattering from a slab (1D), scattering from a finite phononic crystal (1D), and scattering from defects in a waveguide (2D). ",

The case of planar positron channeling (quasi-channeling) and linear polarized laser wave is considered in detail up to TeV energies. The crucial difference between LRS and CR is that in the former case both invariants are independent, while in channeling they are linearly related to each other. This leads to a strong limitation on the range of possible values of these invariants in OC. On the other hand, OC make it possible to study QED processes in strong non-uniform external fields. ",

The ~10 K trap depth will be produced by a tightly-focused, 1064-nm cavity capable of reaching intensities of hundreds of GW/cm$^2$. Molecules will be directly buffer-gas loaded into the trap using a helium buffer gas at 1.5 K. The very far-off-resonant, quasi-electrostatic trapping mechanism is insensitive to a molecule's internal state, energy level structure, and its electric and magnetic dipole moment. Here, we theoretically investigate the trapping and loading dynamics, as well as the heating and loss rates, and conclude that $10^4$-$10^6$ molecules are likely to be trapped. Our trap would open new possibilities in molecular spectroscopy, studies of cold chemical reactions, and precision measurement, amongst other fields of physics. ",

Different approaches have been proposed to localize light, including those based on dynamical localization, topological trivial or nontrivial defects in the band gap of photonic crystals, and bound states in the continuum. Recent studies on non-Hermitian skin effect have provided us new means to localize waves. In this work, we propose a new method towards localized light, called photonic corner skin modes arising from second-order non-Hermitian skin effect and gain-loss symmetry on a lattice. Specifically, we propose to make use of small pseudo-inversion symmetric gain/loss, which does not close the band gap, to realize a photonic Chern insulator with chiral edge states. The chiral edge states then accumulate at certain corners of the system. Intriguing phenomena such as corner skin modes arising from an underlying bipolar second-order non-Hermitian skin effect and multiple-corner skin modes are predicted in continuous systems. ",

We propose to use atoms in order to exploit the fact that orders of magnitude larger fluxes compared to those of neutrons are available. Moreover, recently the qBounce collaboration, performing GQS spectroscopy with neutrons, reported a discrepancy between theoretical calculations and experiment which deserves further investigations.

The normal blood pressure of human being is 120/80 mmHg. But this range varies in case of any stress, hypertension and some other health issues. Analytical simulation is implemented using MATLAB. Basically, normal mode capacitive pressure sensors have a fixed plate and a moveable diaphragm which deflects on application of pressure with the condition that it must not touch the fixed plate. Deflection depends on material as well as thickness, shape and size of diaphragm which can be of circular, elliptical, square or rectangular shape. In this paper, circular shape is chosen due to higher sensitivity compared to other diaphragm shapes. Deflection, base capacitance, change in capacitance after applying pressure and sensitivity are reported for systolic and diastolic blood pressure monitoring application, and study involves determining the optimized design for the sensor. Diaphragm deflection shows linear variation with applied pressure, which follows Hooks law. The variation in capacitance is logarithmic function of applied pressure, which is utilized for analytical simulation. ",

Channels with high refractive index contrast can provide very compact PIC components whereas structures with lower index exhibit less propagation loss.

Here, we devise a new approach to realize compact and low-loss hybrid optical waveguides based on the interaction of weak optical modes. This is a rather universal approach that can be applied to a wide range of optical materials. To prove the principle, the hybrid waveguide structure is formed by combining a low-index polymer and a thin layer of silicon nitride. For this material combination, a minimum bending radius of 90 micron (for a bending loss of 0.005 dB/90o ) and an upper limit for the optical loss of 0.7 dB/cm are achieved. The viability of this platform is demonstrated through a series of high-performance novel PIC components. This hybrid waveguide platform enabled by a powerful and simple design concept holds great promise for high-density and low-loss PICs. ",

Upgrading the cavity necessitates a months-long laborious process of removing external optics, venting, replacing the resonator, baking, and replacing optics, constituting a substantial bottleneck to innovation in resonator design. In this work, we demonstrate that the flexibility of optical cavities, and the quick turnaround time in switching between them, can be restored with the vacuum loadlock technique--reducing the cycle time to install a cavity, bake it, and transport it into the science chamber to days, achieving 3x10^(-10) Torr pressure in the science chamber.

High-performance disturbance rejection and control of optical spots require the development of disturbance estimation and data-driven Kalman filter methods. Motivated by this, we propose a unified and experimentally verified data-driven framework for optical-spot disturbance modeling and tuning of covariance matrices of Kalman filters. Our approach is based on covariance estimation, nonlinear optimization, and subspace identification methods. Also, we use spectral factorization methods to emulate optical-spot disturbances with a desired power spectral density in an optical laboratory environment. We test the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on an experimental setup consisting of a piezo tip-tilt mirror, piezo linear actuator, and a CMOS camera. ",

Characterization of the quantum properties of the color centers in the semiconductor materials and ensuring that these properties are uniform over a wide area are key issues for developing quantum sensing devices based on color center. In this article, we will describe the principle and performance of a newly developed confocal microscope system with a long Rayleigh length (LRCFM). This system can characterize a wider area faster than the confocal microscope systems commonly used for color center evaluation. ",

In particular, all multidimensional Gaussian states (pure or mixed) can in principle be reconstructed if the quantum system is well localized in configuration space. The main observation which makes this possible is that the John ellipsoid of the Cartesian product of the position localization by its polar dual contains a quantum blob, and can therefore be identified with the covariance ellipsoid of a quantum state.

    "abstract": "Monatomic antimony thin films have recently attracted attention for applications in phase change memory, nanophotonics, and 2D materials. Although some promising results have been reported, the true potential of Sb thin films is still hindered by the scalability issue and the lack of reliable bottom-up production. Here we demonstrate the growth of Sb thin films on a lattice-matching and amorphous substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). C-axis out-of-plane textured Sb thin films were successfully deposited on Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and SiO$_2$\\Si$_3$N$_4$ substrates. In the case of growth on Sb$_2$Te$_3$, we show that an intermediate phase is formed at the Sb$_2$Te$_3$-Sb interface playing a crucial role in forming a solid coupling and thus maintaining epitaxy leading to the production of high-quality Sb thin films. A 3 - 4 nm amorphous Sb seed layer was used to induce texture and suitable surface termination for the growth of Sb thin films on amorphous substrates. The deposition parameters were fine-tuned, and the growth was monitored in situ by a Reflective High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscopy (S/TEM) unveiled the local structure of produced films showing the formation of $\\beta$-phase Sb thin films. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to produce very smooth high-quality antimony thin films with uniform coverage, from few layers to large thicknesses, using pulsed laser deposition. We believe the results of our work on scalable and controllable Sb growth have the potential to open up research on phase-change materials and optoelectronics research. ",

    "abstract": "We achieved continuous-wave 8.3-dB squeezed light generation using a terahertz-order-broadband waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA) by improving a measurement setup from our previous work [T. Kashiwazaki, et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 119, 251104 (2021)], where a low-loss periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide had shown 6.3-dB squeezing at a 6-THz frequency. First, to improve efficiency of the squeezed light detection, we reduced effective optical loss to about 12% by removing extra optics and changing the detection method into a low-loss balanced homodyne measurement. Second, to minimize phase-locking fluctuation, we constructed a frequency-optimized phase-locking system by comprehending its frequency responses. Lastly, we found optimal experimental parameters of a measurement frequency and a pump power from their dependences for the squeezing levels. The measurement frequency was decided as 11 MHz to maximize a clearance between shot and circuit noises. Furthermore, pump power was optimized as 660 mW to get higher squeezing level while suppressing anti-squeezed-noise contamination due to an imperfection of phase locking. To our knowledge, this is the first achievement of over-8-dB squeezing by waveguide OPAs without any loss-correction and circuit-noise correction. Moreover, it is shown that the squeezing level soon after our PPLN waveguide is estimated at over 10 dB, which is thought to be mainly restricted by the waveguide loss. This broadband highly-squeezed light opens the possibility to realize fault-tolerant ultra-fast optical quantum computers. ",

    "abstract": "Silicon is indispensable in semiconductor industry. Understanding its high-temperature thermodynamic properties is essential both for theory and applications. However, first-principle description of high-temperature thermodynamic properties of silicon (thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat) is still incomplete. Strong deviation of its specific heat at high temperatures from the Dulong-Petit law suggests substantial contribution of anharmonicity effects. We demonstrate, that anharmonicity is mostly due to two transverse phonon modes, propagating in (111) and (100) directions, and can be quantitatively described with formation of the certain type of nanostructured planar defects of the crystal structure. Calculation of these defects' formation energy enabled us to determine their input into the specific heat and thermal expansion coefficient. This contribution turns out to be significantly greater than the one calculated in quasi-harmonic approximation. ",

The resulting radial electron-hole separation is evidenced by several distinct effects which occur in the presence of ZnSe shell, including: the optical emission redshift of about 250 meV, a significant decrease of the emission intensity, the increase of the excitonic lifetime by one order of magnitude and the increase of the biexciton binding energy. The type II nanowire quantum dots where electrons and holes are radially separated constitute a promising platform for potential applications in the field of quantum information technology. ",

Long term volumetric imaging on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids is demonstrated, highlighting tissue and cell organisation as well as cell shape, motility and division. Imaging on retinal explants highlights single 3D cone and rod structures. An optimal workflow for data acquisition, postprocessing and saving is demonstrated, resulting in a time gain factor of 10 compared to prior state of the art. Finally, a method to increase D-FFOCT signal-to-noise ratio is demonstrated, allowing rapid organoid screening. ",
