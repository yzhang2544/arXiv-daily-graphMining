    "abstract": "Although the temperature of a thermodynamic system is usually believed to be a positive quantity, under particular conditions, negative temperature equilibrium states are also possible. Negative temperature equilibriums have been observed with spin systems, cold atoms in optical lattices and two-dimensional quantum superfluids. Here we report the observation of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of light waves to negative temperature equilibrium states. The optical wave relaxes to the equilibrium state through its propagation in a multimode optical fiber, i.e., in a conservative Hamiltonian system. The bounded energy spectrum of the optical fiber enables negative temperature equilibriums with high energy levels (high order fiber modes) more populated than low energy levels (low order modes). Our experiments show that negative temperature speckle beams are featured, in average, by a non-monotonous radial intensity profile. The experimental results are in quantitative agreement with the Rayleigh-Jeans theory without free parameters. Bringing negative temperatures to the field of optics opens the door to the investigation of fundamental issues of negative temperature states in a flexible experimental environment. ",

Here, we show that propagation loss as low as 0.42 dB/cm can be achieved using foundry compatible processes by solely reducing waveguide surface roughness. By post-processing the fabricated devices using rapid thermal anneal (RTA) and furnace anneal, we achieve propagation losses down to 0.28 dB/cm and 0.06 dB/cm, respectively. These low losses are comparable to the conventional devices using high temperature, high-stress low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) films. We also tune the dispersion of the devices, and proved that these devices can be used for linear and nonlinear applications. Low threshold parametric oscillation, broadband frequency combs and narrow-linewidth laser are demonstrated. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of scalable photonic systems based on foundries. ",

Later, the effect of the two-temperature electron population on soliton amplitude and width is studied by varying the magnitude of the pole cusp-magnetic field.

    "abstract": "Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) use near-infrared light for imaging optical properties of biological tissues. Time-domain DOT systems use pulsed lasers and measure time-varying temporal point spread function (TPSF), carrying information from both superficial and deep layers of imaged target. In this work, feasibility of nanosecond scale light pulses as sources for time-domain DOT is studied. Nanosecond sources enable using relatively robust measurement setups with standard analog-to-digital converter waveform digitizers, such as digital oscilloscopes. However, this type of systems have variations in source pulses and limited temporal sampling, that could limit their usage. In this work, these different aspects and possible limitations were studied with simulations and experiments. Simulations showed that information carried by time-domain data of diffuse medium is on low frequencies. This enables usage of relatively slow response time measurement electronics, and image processing using Fourier-transformed time-domain data. Furthermore, the temporal sampling in measurements needs to be high enough to capture the TPSF, but this rate can be achieved with standard digital oscilloscopes. It was shown that, although variations in light pulses of nanosecond lasers are larger than those of picosecond sources, they do not affect significantly on image quality. In this work, a prototype time-domain DOT experimental system utilising a high-energy nanosecond laser was constructed. The system consisted of a nanosecond Nd-YAG laser combined with optical parametric oscillator for light input, and avalanche photodetector and high-bandwidth oscilloscope for TPSF measurements. The system was used in both absolute and difference imaging of two phantoms. The experiments verified that both absorbing and scattering objects can be reconstructed with time-domain DOT using a nanosecond laser. ",

Polariton systems often display larger nonlinearities than their photonic counterparts due to their material component. In this work, we theoretically investigate how to optically control the topological properties of molecular and solid-state exciton-polariton systems by exploiting one such nonlinearity: saturation of electronic transitions. We study an optically pumped film of porphyrin molecules strongly coupled to the photon modes of a perylene filled Fabry-Perot cavity. Here, optical pumping with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry instead of the frequently used large magnetic fields. We can optically tune properties such as the Berry curvature and Chern numbers of the bands. Importantly, while optical pumping does lead to non-zero Chern invariants, unidirectional edge states do not emerge in our system as the bulk-boundary correspondence is not applicable. Finally, we illustrate the broad applicability of our scheme by computing the Berry curvature of two other systems with slightly modified level structures that lead to different nonlinear behavior when placed in a microcavity and pumped with circularly polarized light: (a) monolayer MoS$_2$ and (b) Ce:YAG. This work demonstrates a versatile platform to control topological properties of hybrid light-matter systems to enrich the toolbox of optoelectronic materials. ",

Here, we present a tutorial review on the conservation of momentum in time-varying media. We demonstrate that the Minkowski momentum is a conserved quantity with three independent approaches of increasing complexity: (i) via the application of the boundary conditions for Maxwell equations at a temporal boundary, (ii) testing for constants of motion and deriving conservation laws, and (iii) applying temporal and spatial translations within the framework of the Lagrangian theory of the electromagnetic field.

At this high density where the average distance between atoms is comparable to the probe wavelength, standard imaging techniques suffer from large systematic errors. To spatially probe frequency shifts in the clock and measure thermodynamic properties of this system, accurate imaging techniques at high optical depths are required. Using a combination of highly saturated fluorescence and absorption imaging, we confirm the density distribution in our 3D optical lattice in agreement with a single spin band insulating state. Combining our clock platform with this high filling fraction opens the door to studying new classes of long-lived, many-body states arising from dipolar interactions. ",

Despite its enormous potential, the necessity to label the sample may adversely influence the delicate biology under investigation. Thus, continued development efforts are needed to surpass the far-field label-free diffraction barrier. The coherence of the detected light in label-free mode hinders the application of existing super-resolution methods based on incoherent fluorescence imaging. In this article, we present the physics and propose a methodology to circumvent this challenge by exploiting the photoluminescence of silicon nitride waveguides for near-field illumination of unlabeled samples. The technique is abbreviated EPSLON, Evanescently decaying Photoluminescence Scattering enables Label-free Optical Nanoscopy. We demonstrate that such an illumination has properties that mimics the photo-kinetics of nano-sized fluorescent molecules. This allows to develop a label-free incoherent system that is linear in intensity, and stable with time thereby permitting the application of techniques like structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and intensity-fluctuation based optical nanoscopy (IFON) in label-free mode to circumvent the diffraction limit. We experimentally demonstrate label-free super-resolution imaging of nanobeads (polystyrene and gold), extra-cellular vesicles and human placenta tissue. We believe EPSLON is a step forward within the nascent field of label-free super-resolution microscopy that holds the key to investigate delicate biological systems in its natural state without the need for exogenous labels.

    "title": "How do Quantum Effects Influence the Capacitance and Carrier Density of  Monolayer MoS$_2$ Transistors?",
    "abstract": "When transistor gate insulators have nanometer-scale equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), the gate capacitance ($C_\\textrm{G}$) becomes smaller than the oxide capacitance ($C_\\textrm{ox}$) due to the quantum capacitance and charge centroid capacitance of the channel. Here, we study the capacitance of monolayer MoS$_\\textrm{2}$ as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) channel while considering spatial variations in the potential, charge density, and density of states. At 0.5 nm EOT, the monolayer MoS$_\\textrm{2}$ capacitance is smaller than its quantum capacitance, limiting the single-gated $C_\\textrm{G}$ of an n-type channel to between 63% and 78% of $C_\\textrm{ox}$ for gate overdrive voltages between 0.5 and 1 V. Despite these limitations, for dual-gated devices, the on-state $C_\\textrm{G}$ of monolayer MoS$_\\textrm{2}$ is 50% greater than that of silicon at 0.5 nm EOT and more than three times that of InGaAs at 1 nm EOT, indicating that 2D semiconductors are promising for nanoscale devices at future technology nodes.

    "abstract": "There has been a lot of buzz surrounding the latest Nature paper, \"Traversable wormhole dynamics on a quantum processor\". The Nature paper discusses an experiment in which Google's Sycamore quantum processor is used to simulate a sparsified version of an SYK model. It is shown that the simplified model preserves the key gravitational characteristics of the original SYK model and that it is sufficient to produce a traversable wormhole behavior. The experiment does not create an actual wormhole. Rather, the team of researchers shows an equivalence between a gravity picture and a quantum information picture. This paper gives an account of the experiment and addresses philosophical questions arising from the theoretical and experimental work. ",

    "abstract": "We present a study of the principal deuterium Hugoniot for pressures up to $150$ GPa, using Machine Learning potentials (MLPs) trained with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energies, forces and pressures. In particular, we adopted a recently proposed workflow based on the combination of Gaussian kernel regression and $\\Delta$-learning. By fully taking advantage of this method, we explicitly considered finite-temperature electrons in the dynamics, whose effects are highly relevant for temperatures above $10$ kK. The Hugoniot curve obtained by our MLPs shows an excellent agreement with the most recent experiments, with an accuracy comparable to the best DFT functionals. Our work demonstrates that QMC can be successfully combined with $\\Delta$-learning to deploy reliable MLPs for complex extended systems across different thermodynamic conditions, by keeping the QMC precision at the computational cost of a mean-field calculation.
