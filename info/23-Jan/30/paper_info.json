    "abstract": "In a grid-less Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma thruster with a diverging magnetic nozzle, the magnitude of the ambipolar field accelerating the positive ions depends of the perpendicular energy gained by the electrons. This work investigates the heating of the electrons by electromagnetic waves, taking their bouncing motion into account in a confining well formed by the magnetic mirror force and the electrostatic potential of the thruster. An electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code is used to simulate the plasma in a magnetic field tube. The code's Maxwell solver is based on a semi-Lagrangian scheme known as the Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP) which enables larger time steps. The results show that anisotropic plasma heating takes place exclusively inside the coaxial chamber, along a Doppler-broadened zone. It is also shown that a trapped population of electrons with a larger perpendicular energy exists in the plume. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, sub-ppb aerosol detection is achieved by femtosecond laser filament with a single pulse energy of 4 mJ at a distance of 30 m. A concave mirror with an open aperture of 41.4 cm is employed in an off-axis optical system to focus the femtosecond laser beam and collect the fluorescence of NaCl aerosol. The simulation and experimental results show that the astigmatism can be greatly reduced when femtosecond laser beam is incident non-symmetrically on the concave mirror. Compared with the case that femtosecond laser strikes at the center of the concave mirror, the intensity of the optical filament is increased by 69.5 times, and the detection of limit of sodium chloride aerosol is reduced by 86%, which is down to 0.32 ppb. The improved excitation scheme in this work utilizes the nonsymmetrical beam spot on the concave mirror to compensate the non-symmetry induced by the off-axis setup, reducing the astigmatism of the focusing laser beam and improving the aerosol's detection of limit.

    "abstract": "Photoinduced carrier dynamics of nanostructures play a crucial role in developing novel functionalities in advanced materials. Optical pump-probe scanning tunneling microscopy (OPP-STM) represents distinctive capabilities of real-space imaging of such carrier dynamics with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, combining the advanced technology of ultrafast pulsed lasers with STM for stable time-resolved measurements has remained challenging. The recent OPP-STM system, whose laser-pulse timing is electrically controlled by external triggers, has significantly simplified this combination but limited its application due to nanosecond temporal resolution. Here we report an externally-triggerable OPP-STM system with a temporal resolution in the tens-picosecond range. We also realize the stable laser illumination of the tip-sample junction by placing a position-movable aspheric lens driven by piezo actuators directly on the STM stage and by employing an optical beam stabilization system. We demonstrate the OPP-STM measurements on GaAs(110) surfaces, observing carrier dynamics with a decay time of $\\sim170$ ps and revealing local carrier dynamics at features including a step edge and a nanoscale defect. The stable OPP-STM measurements with the tens-picosecond resolution by the electrical control of laser pulses highlight the potential capabilities of this system for investigating nanoscale carrier dynamics of a wide range of functional materials.

    "abstract": "A Python program has been developed which fits a published detector-response model to SiPM charge spectra to characterise SiPMs. Spectra for SiPMs illuminated by low intensity pulsed light with Poisson-distributed number of photons and a time spread of order nanoseconds or less, can be analysed. The entire charge spectra, including the intervals in-between the photoelectron peaks, are fitted, which allows determining, in addition to the mean number of detected photons, gain, gain spread, prompt cross-talk, pedestal, and electronics noise, the dark-count rate as well as the probability and time constant of after-pulses. The starting values of the fit parameters are extracted from the charge spectra. The program performance has been evaluated using simulated charge spectra with the different SiPM parameters varied in a wide range. By analysing 100 simulated spectra for every parameter set, the biases and statistical uncertainties of the individual parameters have been determined. It is found that the parameters are precisely determined and that the entire spectra are well described, in most cases with a $\\chi ^2$/NDF close to 1. In addition, measured spectra for two types of SiPMs for a wide range of over-voltages have been analysed. The program achieves mostly a good description of the spectra, and the parameters determined agree with the values from the producers and expectations. The program can be used for detailed analyses of single spectra, but, as it is compatible with the native \\texttt{Python} multiprocessing module, also for the automatic characterisation of large samples of SiPMs. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the role of gravity in solute transport when a thin droplet evaporates. Under the physically-relevant assumptions that the contact line is pinned and the solutal P\\'{e}clet number, $\\mbox{Pe}$ is large, we identify two fundamental regimes that depend on the size of the Bond number, $\\mbox{Bo}$. When $\\mbox{Bo} = O(1)$, the asymptotic structure of solute transport follows directly from the surface tension-dominated regime, whereby advection drives solute towards the contact line, only to be countered by local diffusive effects, leading to the formation of the famous ``coffee ring\". For larger Bond numbers, we identify the distinguished limit in which $\\mbox{Bo}^{-1/2}\\mbox{Pe}^{2/3} = O(1)$, where the diffusive boundary layer is comparable to the surface tension boundary layer. In each regime, we perform a systematic asymptotic analysis of the solute transport and compare our predictions to numerical simulations of the full model. Our analysis identifies the effect of gravity on the nascent coffee ring, providing quantitative predictions of the size, location and shape of the solute mass profile. Furthermore, we reveal that, for certain values of $\\mbox{Bo}$, $\\mbox{Pe}$ and the evaporation time, a secondary peak may exist inside the classical coffee ring. We find that the onset of this secondary peak is linked to the change in behaviour of the critical point in the droplet centre. Both the onset and the peak characteristics are shown to be independent of $\\mbox{Pe}$, but solutal diffusion may act to remove the secondary peak when the classical coffee ring becomes so large as to subsume it.

These states form through the locking of uniform wave fronts, or domain walls, connecting two coexisting stable uniform states.

We characterize the robustness of these states by computing their stability and bifurcation structure as a function of the main control parameter of the system.

    "abstract": "It is shown that the intensity quantum noise of a single-emitter nanolaser can be accurately computed by adopting a stochastic interpretation of the standard rate equation model under the only assumption that the emitter excitation and photon number are stochastic variables with integer values. This extends the validity of rate equations beyond the mean-field limit and avoids using the standard Langevin approach, which is shown to fail for few emitters. The model is validated by comparison to full quantum simulations of the relative intensity noise and second-order intensity correlation function, g(2)({\\tau} ). Surprisingly, even when the full quantum model displays vacuum Rabi oscillations, which are not accounted for by rate equations, the intensity quantum noise is correctly predicted by the stochastic approach. Adopting a simple discretization of the emitter and photon populations, thus, goes a long way in describing quantum noise in lasers. Besides providing a versatile and easy-to-use tool for modeling a new generation of nanolasers with many possible applications, these results provide insight into the fundamental nature of quantum noise in lasers.

We benchmark the performance of our system by single-particle quantum walks in the square, triangular, kagome and Lieb lattice. In the strongly correlated regime, we microscopically characterize the geometry dependence of the quantum fluctuations and experimentally validate the brane parity as a proxy for the non-local order parameter signaling the superfluid-to-Mott insulating phase transition.
