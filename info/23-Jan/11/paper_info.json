    "abstract": "A fundamental, Quantum Mechanical description of photoactivation of a generic photosensitizer and the ensuing transfer of energy to endogenous oxygen as part of the Type II pathway to photodamage during photodynamic therapy (PDT) is presented. The PS and molecular oxygen are approximated as two-electron molecules. Conservation of energy and of angular momenta of the two molecule system are abided via selection rules throughout the four-stage process, including initial states, absorption of a photon by the PS, conversion of the PS to an excited spin triplet via intersystem crossing (ISC), and the transition of molecular oxygen to an excited spin singlet state via a Triplet-Triplet Exchange of electrons with the PS. The provided description of photosensitization will provide students and researchers with a fundamental introduction to PDT, while offering the broader population of Quantum Mechanics and Physical Chemistry students an advanced example of quantum systems in an applied, medical context.

On the contrary, noise in stochastic resonance (SR) is beneficial to enhance weak signals of interest embedded in signals with strong background noise. Taking into account that nonlinear systems are crucial ingredients to activate the SR, here we investigate the SR in the cases of overdamped and underdamped harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential systems subjected to noise and a periodic signal. We derive and measure the analytic expression of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the steady-state probability density (SPD) function under approximate adiabatic conditions. When the harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential loses its stability, we can observe the antiresonance phenomenon, whereas adding the damped factor into the overdamped system can change the stability of the harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential, resulting that the antiresonance behavior disappears in the underdamped system. Then, we use the overdamped and underdamped harmonic-Gaussian double-well potential SR to enhance weak useful characteristics for diagnosing incipient rotating machinery failures. ",

    "abstract": "Bloch waves in 1D periodic systems carry Zak phase, which plays a key role in determining the band topology. In general, for systems that possess inversion symmetry, the Zak phase of an isolated band is quantized as 0 or Pi and is associated with the spatial field symmetries at the Brillouin zone center and boundary. The phase is Pi if the field symmetries are different but is 0 when they are the same. Since the radiation losses from leaky systems are strongly associated with the Bloch waves, one may probe the far-field continuum to determine the Zak phases. Here, we formulate the diffractions from photonic systems at the zone center and boundary and find their spectral profiles reveal the Bloch wave symmetries and thereby the corresponding Zak phase. The field symmetries also generalize the occurrence of bound states in the continuum at high symmetry points. For verification, we have studied the Zak phases of one-dimensional TM plasmonic and TE photonic crystals by electrodynamic simulations and measuring the optical properties of plasmonic crystals using Fourier space diffraction spectroscopy and common path interferometry. In addition, a topological protected interface state is demonstrated when two 0 and Pi systems are joined together. The results prove our method provides a simple way for characterizing the band topology of non-Hermitian systems via far-fields. ",

The reconstructed time-dependent dipole from experimentally measured XUV absorption spectra provides access to the revival of the vibrational wave packet, which we control via an intense near-infrared (NIR) pulse. Tuning the intensity of the NIR pulse we observe the revival of the wave packet to be significantly modified, which is supported by the results of a multi-level simulation. The NIR field is applied only 7 fs after the creation of the wave packet but influences its evolution up to at least its first revival at 270 fs. This experimental approach for nonlocal-in-time laser control of quantum dynamics is generally applicable to a large range of molecules and materials as it only requires the observation of absorption spectra.

    "abstract": "Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (DMAPS) sensors developed in the Tower Semiconductor 180 nm CMOS imaging process have been designed in the context of the ATLAS ITk upgrade Phase-II at the HL-LHC and for future collider experiments. The ``MALTA-Czochralski (MALTA-Cz)'' full size DMAPS sensor has been developed with the goal to demonstrate a radiation hard, thin CMOS sensor with high granularity, high hit-rate capability, fast response time and superior radiation tolerance. The small pixel size ($36.4\\times 36.4$~$\\mu$m$^2$) provides high spatial resolution. Its asynchronous readout architecture is designed for high hit-rates and fast time response in triggered and trigger-less detector applications. The readout architecture is designed to stream all hit data to the multi-channel output which allows an off-sensor trigger formation and the use of hit-time information for event tagging. The sensor manufacturing has been optimised through process adaptation and special implant designs to allow the manufacturing of small electrode DMAPS on thick high-resistivity p-type Czochralski substrate. The special processing ensures excellent charge collection and charge particle detection efficiency even after a high level of radiation. Furthermore the special implant design and use of a Czochralski substrate improves the sensor's time resolution. This paper presents a summary of sensor design optimisation through process and implant choices and TCAD simulation to model the signal response. Beam and laboratory test results on unirradiated and irradiated sensors have shown excellent detection efficiency after a dose of $2\\times10^{15}$ 1 MeV n$_{eq}$/cm$^{2}$. The time resolution of the sensor is measured to be $\\sigma=2$~ns. ",

Tight confinement of near-infrared photons and gigahertz phonons in integrated waveguides remains a key challenge to achieving strong on-chip Brillouin gain. Here, we propose a new strategy to harness Brillouin gain in silicon waveguides, based on the combination of genetic algorithm optimization and periodic subwavelength structuration to engineer photonic and phononic modes simultaneously. The proposed geometry is composed of a waveguide core and a lattice of anchoring arms with a subwavelength period requiring a single etch step. The waveguide geometry is optimized to maximize the Brillouin gain using a multi-physics genetic algorithm. Our simulation results predict a remarkable Brillouin gain exceeding 3300 1/(W m), for a mechanical frequency near 15 GHz. ",

A vast majority of such investigations rely on a dissipative, balanced loss-gain system which introduces unavoidable noise and consequently, this limits the coherent control of propagation dynamics. Here, we show that an all-dielectric, non-dissipative photonic crystal (PC) could host, at least two exceptional points in its eigenvalue spectrum. By introducing optimum apodization in the PC architecture, namely 1D-APC, we show that such a configuration supports a spectrum of exceptional points which distinctly demarcates the PT-symmetric region from the region where PT -symmetry is broken in the parameter space. The analytical framework allows us to estimate the geometric phase of the reflected beam and derive the constraint that governs the excitation of topologically-protected optical Tamm-plasmon modes in 1D-APCs.

    "abstract": "Lithium metal batteries suffer from low cycle life. During discharge, parts of the lithium are not stripped reversibly and remain isolated from the current collector. This isolated lithium is trapped in the insulating remaining solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) shell and contributes to the capacity loss. However, a fundamental understanding of why isolated lithium forms and how it can be mitigated is lacking. In this article, we perform a combined theoretical and experimental study to understand isolated lithium formation during stripping. We derive a thermodynamic consistent model of lithium dissolution and find that the interaction between lithium and SEI leads to locally preferred stripping and isolated lithium formation. Based on a cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) setup, we reveal that these local effects are particularly pronounced at kinks of lithium whiskers. We find that lithium stripping can be heterogeneous both on a nanoscale and on a larger scale. Cryo TEM observations confirm our theoretical prediction that isolated lithium occurs less at higher stripping current densities. The origin of isolated lithium lies in local effects, such as heterogeneous SEI, stress fields, or the geometric shape of the deposits. We conclude that in order to mitigate isolated lithium, a uniform lithium morphology during plating and a homogeneous SEI is indispensable. ",

Recent studies have started to explore the possibility to control an electronic material by embedding it in a cavity that confines electromagnetic fields in deep subwavelength scales. Currently, there is a strong motivation to realize ultrastrong-coupling cavity QED in the terahertz (THz) range, since most of the elementary excitations of quantum materials are in this frequency window. We propose and analyze an ideal platform to achieve this aim where a two-dimensional electronic material is encapsulated by a planar cavity consisting of ultrathin polar van der Waals crystals. As a concrete setup, we show that nanometer-thick hexagonal boron nitride layers allow for reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime for single-electron cyclotron resonance in a bilayer graphene. The proposed cavity setting can be realized by a wide variety of thin dielectric materials with hyperbolic dispersions. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures could provide an ideal playground for exploring the ultrastrong-coupling physics of cavity QED materials. ",

To name but one application, this acoustic contrast can be exploited using acoustophoretic systems to isolate cancer cells from a liquid biopsy, such as a blood sample. Knowing the ACF of a cancer cell represents a crucial step in the design of acoustophoretic systems for this purpose, potentially allowing the isolation of circulating cancer cells without labels or contact. For biological cells the static compressibility is different from the high frequency counterpart relevant for the ACF. In this study, we started by characterizing the ACF of low vs. high metastatic cell lines with known associated differences in phenotypic static E-modulus. The change in the static E-modulus, however, was not reflected in a change of the ACF, prompting a more in depth analysis of the influences on the ACF. We demonstrate that static E-modulus increased biological cells through formaldehyde fixation have an increased ACF. Conversely static E-modulus decreased biological cells treated with actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D have a decreased ACF. Complementing these mechanical tests, a numerical COMSOL model was implemented and used to parametrically explore the effects of cell density, cell density ratios, dynamic compressibility and therefore the dynamic bulk modulus. Collectively the combined laboratory and numerical experiments reveal that a change in the static E-modulus alone might, but does not automatically lead to a change of the dynamic ACF for biological cells. This highlights the need for a multiparametic view of the biophysical basis of the cellular ACF, as well as the challenges in harnessing acoustophoretic systems to isolate circulating cells based on their mechanical properties alone.
