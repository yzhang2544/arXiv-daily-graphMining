As e.g. stimulated emission-absorption are CPT analogs, and one can be used for state preparation, there should also exist its CPT analog: CPT(state preparation) - allowing for additional chosen enforcement of the final state. It would act similarity as postselection, but through physical constraints instead of running multiple times.

If possible, for example for an instance of 3-SAT problem on $n$ variables, we could prepare ensemble of $2^n$ inputs with Hadamard gates, calculate 3-SAT alternatives for them, and try to use CPT(state preparation) to enforce outcomes of all these alternatives to \"1\". This way hopefully restricting this ensemble to satisfying given 3-SAT problem: $\\sum_{a:SAT(a)} |a\\rangle$, in theory allowing to attack NP problems by simultaneously pushing and pulling information through the system for better control.

    "abstract": "A system of ${N_{osc}}$ charged oscillators interacting with the electromagnetic field, spatially confined in a 3D lattice of sub-wavelength dimension, can condense into a superradiant coherent state if appropriate density and frequency conditions are met. In this state, the common frequency $\\omega$ of the oscillators and the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$ of the charges are combined into a frequency $\\omega'=\\sqrt{\\omega^2+\\omega_p^2}$ that is off-shell with respect to the wavelength of the photon modes involved, preventing them from propagating outside the material. Unlike other atomic cavity systems, the frequency $\\omega$ in this case is not determined by the cavity itself but is defined by the periodic electrostatic potential that confines the charged particles in the lattice. Additionally, the electromagnetic modes involved have wave vectors distributed in all spatial directions, resulting in a significant increase in coupling. The analytical study of this system can be carried out in the limit of large ${N_{osc}}$ by searching for an approximation of the ground state via suitable coherent trial states. Alternatively, numerical simulations can be employed for smaller ${N_{osc}}$. In the numerical approach, it is possible to go beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) and introduce a dissipation term for the photon modes. This dissipation term can account for the ohmic quench in a metal and also consider photon losses at the boundary of the material. By utilizing numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of condensation has been confirmed, and an energy gap of a few electron volts (eV) per particle has been observed in typical metal crystals with protons bound to tetrahedral or octahedral sites.

This study demonstrated that the definition of $\\nu$ entails the relativistic quantum electrodynamics phenomena intrinsically related to the perturbation of the density-of-states $\\left( dn/dE \\right) = C_q/e^2$ by an external harmonic oscillatory potential energy variation. On this basis, the electronic structure of graphene embedded in an electrolyte environment was computed. The electronic structure measured using quantum-rate spectroscopy (QRS) is in good agreement with that measured through angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) or calculated via computational density-functional theory (DFT) methods. Electrochemical QRS has evident experimental advantages over ARPES. For instance, QRS enables obtaining the electronic structure of graphene at room temperature and in an electrolyte environment, whereas ARPES requires low temperature and ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Furthermore, QRS can operate \\textit{in-situ} using a hand-held, inexpensive piece of equipment, whereas ARPES necessarily requires expensive and cumbersome apparatus. ",

In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of fiber optic vibration sensing method on underground fiber cable discrimination. We find that the typical vibration sensing method-distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is not suitable for fiber cable discrimination. Especially for long distance scenario, due to \"frequency grafting\" effect, the DAS method will give a false response on the spectrum of knock events during cable discrimination process. In response, we propose an underground fiber cable discrimination method based on laser interferometer, and demonstrate it on the 40-km urban fiber cable connecting Tsinghua University and Yongding Road. It can give an obvious and real response to the knock event, and can be used in practical applications. ",

Consequently, the experimental investigations predominantly restrict themselves to the bulk-boundary correspondence principle and the ensuing emergence of topological surface state. Although capable of establishing the equivalence or inequivalence of bandgaps, the determination of their absolute topological identity remains out of its purview. The alternate method of reflection phase-based identification also provides only contentious improvements owing to the measurement complexities pertaining to the interferometric setups. To circumvent these limitations, we resort to the Kramers-Kronig amplitude-phase causality considerations and propose an experimentally conducive method for bandgap topological character determination directly from the parametric reflectance measurements. Particularly, it has been demonstrated that in case of one-dimensional photonic crystals, polarization-resolved dispersion measurements suffice in qualitatively determining bandgap absolute topological identities. By invoking the translational invariance of the investigated samples, we also define a parameter Differential Effective Mass that encapsulates bandgap topological identities and engenders an experimentally discernible bandgap classifier.

We fabricate two orthogonal metagratings on a single substrate with an identical resonant wavelength, thereby enabling the spectral indistinguishability of the emitted photons, and demonstrate in experiments that the two-photon polarization states can be shaped by the metagrating orientation. Leveraging this essential property, we formulate a theoretical approach for generating arbitrary polarization-entangled qutrit states by combining three metagratings on a single metasurface, allowing the encoding of desired quantum states or information. Our findings enable miniaturized optically controlled quantum devices using ultrathin metasurfaces as polarization-entangled photon sources. ",

While optimizing the fabrication technique can help circumvent the scattering loss of imperfect structures, the intrinsic absorption channel leading to heat production cannot be eliminated. Here, we utilize synthetic optical excitation of complex frequency with virtual gain, synthesized by combining the measurements taken at multiple real frequencies, to restore the lossless propagations of phonon polaritons with significantly reduced intrinsic losses.

Below the ionization threshold, resonant excitation of multiple centers efficiently induces resonant ICD as previously observed for intense pulses [A. C. LaForge et al., PRX 11, 021011 (2021)]. More surprisingly, we observe ICD even above the ionization threshold due to recombination of photoelectrons and ions into excited states which subsequently decay by ICD. This demonstrates the importance of secondary processes, in particular electron scattering and recombination, in inducing ICD in extended condensed phase systems. In addition, we show that ICD can serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the relaxation dynamics of highly-excited and ionized weakly-bound nanosystems. ",

    "title": "Quantum Next Generation Reservoir Computing: An Efficient Quantum  Algorithm for Forecasting Quantum Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) is a modern class of model-free machine learning that enables an accurate forecasting of time series data generated by dynamical systems. We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately predict full many-body quantum dynamics, instead of merely concentrating on the dynamics of observables, which is the conventional application of reservoir computing. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm for many-body quantum dynamics forecasting with a quantum computational speedup via the block-encoding technique. This proposal presents an efficient model-free quantum scheme to forecast quantum dynamics coherently, bypassing inductive biases incurred in a model-based approach. ",

    "title": "Loss of Detailed Balance in Equilibrium due to Partial Quantum  Decoherence: A Quantum Graph Analogue",
    "abstract": "We explore the physics of quantum systems that suffer from partial decoherence, in the intermediate range between coherent quantum evolution and incoherent classical physics. It has been predicted that new physics and technology are enabled in this intermediate regime. In particular we explore the asymmetric transmission through an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring that supports a 3:1 asymmetry in transmission times, augmented with de-phasing features that act preferentially on the longer-lingering quantum waves. Such a device is realized as a microwave analogue quantum graph utilizing a gyrator to create the 3:1 transmission time delay asymmetry, along with both homogeneous and localized losses to mimic the effects of de-phasing in the analogous mesoscopic electron system. Measurements and simulations of this device demonstrate the required non-reciprocal transmission time delay, as well as an asymmetry in transmission probability. The measurements and simulations are performed in both the frequency domain, and in the time domain using wave packets. We demonstrate asymmetric transmission through the AB-ring graph as a function of loss/de-phasing in both simulation and experiment, in both the frequency- and time-domains, and compare to expectations for the corresponding quantum system. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the transmission asymmetry and loss of detailed balance is an equilibrium property of the analogous mesoscopic quantum graph. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to engineer cavity-mediated interactions has emerged as a powerful tool for the generation of non-local correlations and the investigation of non-equilibrium phenomena in many-body systems. Levitated optomechanical systems have recently entered the multi-particle regime, with promise for using arrays of massive strongly coupled oscillators for exploring complex interacting systems and sensing. Here, by combining advances in multi-particle optical levitation and cavity-based quantum control, we demonstrate, for the first time, programmable cavity-mediated interactions between nanoparticles in vacuum. The interaction is mediated by photons scattered by spatially separated particles in a cavity, resulting in strong coupling ($G_\\text{zz}/\\Omega_\\text{z} = 0.238\\pm0.005$) that does not decay with distance within the cavity mode volume. We investigate the scaling of the interaction strength with cavity detuning and inter-particle separation, and demonstrate the tunability of interactions between different mechanical modes. Our work paves the way towards exploring many-body effects in nanoparticle arrays with programmable cavity-mediated interactions, generating entanglement of motion, and using interacting particle arrays for optomechanical sensing.
