    "abstract": "CMOS-compatible Kerr microcombs have drawn substantial interest as mass-manufacturable, compact alternatives to bulk frequency combs. This could enable deployment of many comb-reliant applications previously confined to laboratories. Particularly enticing is the prospect of microcombs performing optical frequency division in compact optical atomic clocks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to meet the self-referencing requirement of microcombs in these systems due to the $\\sim$THz repetition rates typically required for octave-spanning comb generation. Additionally, it is challenging to spectrally engineer a microcomb system to align a comb mode with an atomic clock transition with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we adopt a Vernier dual-microcomb scheme for optical frequency division of a stabilized ultranarrow-linewidth continuous-wave laser at 871 nm to a $\\sim$235 MHz output frequency. In addition to enabling measurement of the comb repetition rates, this scheme brings the freedom to pick comb lines from either or both of the combs. We exploit this flexibility to shift an ultra-high-frequency ($\\sim$100 GHz) carrier-envelope offset beat down to frequencies where detection is possible and to place a comb line close to the 871 nm laser - tuned so that if frequency-doubled it would fall close to the clock transition in $^{171}$Yb$^+$. Moreover, we introduce a novel scheme which suppresses frequency noise arising from interferometric phase fluctuations in our dual-comb system and reduces the frequency instability down to our measurement limit. Our dual-comb system can potentially combine with an integrated ion trap toward future chip-scale optical atomic clocks. ",

This calls for the challenging combination of high repetition rates and high average power simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Ionization phenomena are widely studied for decades. With the advent of cavity technology, the question arises how the presence of quantum light affects the ionization of molecules. As the ionization spectrum is recorded from the ground state of the neutral molecule, it is usually possible to choose cavities which do not change the ground state of the target, but can have a significant impact on the ion and the ionization spectrum. Particularly interesting are cases where the produced ion exhibits conical intersections between its close-lying electronic states which is known to give rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. We demonstrate by an explicit realistic example that vibrational modes not relevant in the absence of the cavity do play a decisive role when the molecule is in the cavity. In this example, dynamical symmetry breaking is responsible for the coupling between the ion and the cavity and the high spatial symmetry enables a control of their activity via the molecular orientation relative to the cavity field polarization. Significant impact on the spectrum by the cavity is found and shown to even substantially increase when less symmetric molecules are considered. ",

The measurement results obtained from a fluid with low viscoelasticity, specifically a dilute suspension of cellulose nanocrystals, showed that the birefringence increases monotonically as the stress components along the camera's optical axis increase. It was also found that the birefringence showed a power law with respect to the shear rate.

The CBOA potential energy surfaces are compared with those obtained using a polaritonic approach, where the photonic and electronic degrees of freedom are treated at the same level. This allows us to assess the role of electron-photon correlation and the accuracy of CBOA. ",

In this work, we raise a fundamental question: can non-local interactions mediated by cavity photons destabilize a topological electronic phase? We investigate this question by characterizing entanglement, energy spectrum and correlation functions of the topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain interacting with an optical cavity mode. Employing density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED), we demonstrate the stability of the edge state and establish an area law scaling for the ground state entanglement entropy, despite long-range correlations induced by light-matter interactions. These features are linked to gauge invariance and the scaling of virtual photon excitations entangled with matter, effectively computed in a low-dimensional Krylov subspace of the full Hilbert space. This work provides a framework for characterizing novel equilibrium phenomena in topological cavity materials. ",

    "abstract": "The broadening and polarization of excitonic luminescence in monolayer TMDs largely suffer from inhomogeneity and temperature - an unresolved problem to date. In this work, through few-layer-graphene encapsulation of monolayer WS$_2$, we reduce the inter-excitonic energy separation, which then can have a narrow resonance with a specific phonon mode of our choice. The resulting single-step exciton relaxation with the resonating phonon mode significantly suppresses the inhomogeneous broadening, allowing us to achieve the narrowest exciton linewidth of 1.06 meV (which translates to 0.19 meV after deconvolution with the excitation laser linewidth). The single-phonon resonance helps to achieve a high quantum efficiency despite graphene encapsulation. The technique is powerful in tuning the exciton polarization during relaxation by choosing a specific resonating phonon mode. For example, the valley coherence (polarization) improves from $\\sim$68% ($\\sim$40%) to $\\sim$90% ($\\sim$75%) on resonance with 2$A_1$' and $A_1$' modes respectively. We further demonstrate a strong polarization reversal on resonance with a chiral phonon mode. Strikingly, the above features remain robust against temperature (up to 200 K) and sample age (few months in ambient condition). The findings will lead to clean excitonic measurements without requiring cryogenic cooling. ",

Such localization is shown to link the fact that the flat bands of moir\\'{e} lattice support quasi-nondiffracting localized modes and thus induce the localization of the initially localized beam. It would provide a promising approach to control the light propagation via the electromagnetically induced photonic lattice. ",

    "title": "Coherence resonance for time-averaged measures",
    "abstract": "Noise can induce time order in the dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems. For example, coherence resonance occurs in various neuron models driven by a noise. In studies of coherence resonance, ensemble-averaged measures of the coherence are often used. In the present study, we examine coherence resonance for time-averaged measures from a viewpoint of random dynamical systems. For the examination, we use a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model driven by a constant current and a noise. We firstly show that for large times, the neuron is in a stationary state irrespective of initial conditions of the neuron. We then show numerical evidence that in the stationary state, a given noise sample path uniquely determines the dynamics of the neuron. We then present numerical evidence suggesting that time-averaged coherence measures of the dynamics is independent of noise sample paths and is equal to ensemble-averaged coherence measures. On the basis of this property, we show that coherence resonance is not only a phenomenon related to ensemble-averaged measures but also a phenomenon that holds for time-averaged measures. ",
