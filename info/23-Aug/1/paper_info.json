    "abstract": "BlueSTEAl, the Blue (aluminum chamber of) Silicon TElescope Arrays for light nuclei,has been developed to study direct reactions in inverse kinematics, as well as scattering and breakup reactions using radioactive ion beams. It is a detector system consisting of a pair of annular silicon detector arrays and a zero-degree phoswich plastic scintillator. For typical binary reaction studies in inverse kinematics, light ions are detected by the Si array in coincidence with heavy recoils detected by the phoswich placed at the focal-plane of a zero-degree magnetic spectrometer. The Si array can also be used to detect light nuclei such as berylium and carbon with clear isotope separation, while the phoswich can also be placed at zero degrees without a spectrometer and used as a high-efficiency beam counting monitor with particle identification capability at the rate of up to 5*10^4 particles per second. This paper reports on the capabilities of BlueSTEAl as determined by recent experiments performed at the Texas A&M Cyclotron Institute. The device is also anticipated to be used in future experiments at other radioactive ion beam facilities. ",

This minimally intrusive method relies on placing a mask with specially arranged pinholes in the beam path before the focusing optic and retrieving the spectrally-resolved laser wavefront from the speckle pattern produced at focus. We test the efficacy of this new method by accurately retrieving chromatic aberrations, such as pulse front tilt, pulse front curvature, and higher-order aberrations introduced by a spherical lens. The simplicity and scalability of this method, combined with its compatibility with single-shot operation, make it a promising candidate to become a new standard diagnostic tool in high-intensity laser facilities.

In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests. ",

    "abstract": "We studied the underlying mechanism of broadband dispersive-wave emission within a resonance band of gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber. Both theoretical and experimental results unveiled that the high-order soliton, launched into the hollow-core fiber, experienced two stages of pulse compression, resulting in a multi-peak structure of the dispersive-wave spectrum. Over the first-stage pulse compression, a sharp increase of the pulse peak power triggered the first time of dispersion-wave emission, and simultaneously caused ionization of the noble gas filled in the fiber core. Strong soliton-plasma interactions led to blue shifting of the pump pulse, and the blue-shifted pulse experienced a decreasing dispersion value in the fiber waveguide, resulting in an increase of its soliton order. Then, the second-stage pulse compression due to the high-order soliton effect triggered the second time of dispersive-wave emission at a phase-matched frequency slightly lower than that in the first stage. Multi-peak spectra of the output dispersive-waves and their formation dynamics were clearly observed in our experiments, which can be understood using a delicate coupling mechanism among three nonlinear effects including high-order-soliton compression, soliton-plasma interaction and phase-matched dispersive-wave emission. The output broadband dispersive-wave could be potentially compressed to sub-30 fs duration using precise chirp-compensation technique. ",

A long-standing issue has been identified within the literature on injection locking: how the thickness of linewidth and the lineshape waveform envelope correlates with the deterministic evolution of the slave laser oscillator and how the presence of noise and the dense proximity of coexisting limit cycles are shaping and influencing the overall spectral behavior. In addition we are critically interested in the regions where the basin of attraction has self-similar and fractal-like behavior, still, the long-time orbits are limit cycles, in this case, period-one (P1) and period-three (P3). Via numerical work, we find that the overall optical power spectrum is deeply imprinted with a strong influence from the underlying noise when the system lives in the region of the P1 and P3 limit cycles. Additionally, a qualitative comparison is made between the stochastic Langevin simulations and the recorded optical power spectra taken from older experiments that we revisit. Finally, we point to a possible set of next-generation applications in photonics and quantum technologies where such findings may have substantial implications. ",

We reach densities high enough to measure the temperature via absorption imaging using the time-of-flight method. Directly after sub-Doppler cooling we pump atoms into the $F=7/2$ hyperfine ground state and transfer a mixture of $m_F=-3/2,-5/2$ and $-7/2$ Zeeman states into the magnetic trap. We trap $5\\times10^4$ atoms with a lifetime of 0.6~s when the dispensers are heated up to maximize the atom number at a cost of deteriorated background gas pressure. When the dispensers have been off for a day and the magneto-optical trap loading rate has been increased by light induced atomic desorption we can magnetically trap $\\sim$$10^3$ atoms with a lifetime of 2.8~s. The background pressure-limited lifetime of 0.6~s is a reasonable starting point for proof-of-principle experiments with atoms and/or molecules in optical tweezers as well as for sympathetic cooling with another species if transport to a secondary chamber is implemented. Our results show that unenriched potassium can be used to optimize experimental setups containing $^{40}$K in the initial stages of their construction, which can effectively extend the lifetime of enriched sources needed for proper experiments. Moreover, demonstration of sub-Doppler cooling and magnetic trapping of a relatively small number of potassium atoms might influence experiments with laser cooled radioactive isotopes of potassium.

Cooling only by the top and bottom surfaces struggles to evacuate the heat from the middle layers, which hinders the performance of 3D ICs. In this work, we designed through-chip microchannels (TCMCs) that cross the entire chip perpendicularly to the layers, with water circulating inside to provide direct cooling to each layer. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations show that TCMCs with 37.5 um length organized in a square array with a radius of 1.5 um provide the best cooling performance. Applying a water pressure of 1 MPa can sustain a maximum power of 14.1 kW.cm-2 before reaching a temperature increase of 60 K. We show that the cooling properties do not change with the number of layers for a given chip thickness which provides flexibility to the functional design of the chip. These results show the great potential of TCMCs for improving the performance of 3D ICs. ",

I then show how an approximate notion of compositeness may be recovered in the regime where the mass of a bound state is close to a multi-particle threshold.

Mode-selective relative phase manipulation of modes unlocks several processing tasks in mode division multiplexing systems. This integrated solution provides a direct phase manipulation of modes without converting them to their fundamental modes. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is deployed as a test structure incorporating the proposed MS-TOPS in one arm and a mode-insensitive thermo-optic phase shifter (MI-TOPS) in another. The effect of the SWG duty cycle ratio is investigated by both numerical simulations and experimental measurements. A mode-selectivity of 1.44 is experimentally demonstrated. In other words, the thermo-optic coefficient of TE0 is 44% larger than the one for TE1. The phase shifter's insertion loss is at most 2.5 dB and a worst-case crosstalk of -13.1 dB over a 40 nm wavelength range from 1520 to 1560 nm. A cascaded configuration of the proposed MS-TOPS and an MI-TOPS provides sufficient degrees of freedom to manipulate the relative phase of each mode independently. Potential numerous applications of such devices include optical switching, multimode quantum optical processors, and scaling-up conventional optical processors with a mode selective building block.

It characterizes systems that relate to their parent TI through the squaring of their Hamiltonians. Extensions to $2^n$-root topology, where $n$ is the number of squaring operations involved in retrieving the parent TI, were quick to follow. Here, we go one step further and develop the framework for designing general $n$-root TIs, with $n$ any positive integer, using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as the parent TI from which the higher-root versions are constructed. The method relies on using loops of unidirectional couplings as building blocks, such that the resulting model is non-Hermitian and embedded with a generalized chiral symmetry. Edge states are observed at the $n$ branches of the complex energy spectrum, appearing within what we designate as a ring gap, shown to be irreducible to the usual point or line gaps. We further detail on how such an $n$-root model can be realistically implemented in photonic ring systems. Near perfect unidirectional effective couplings between the main rings can be generated via mediating auxiliary rings with modulated gains and losses. These induce high imaginary gauge fields that strongly supress couplings in one direction, while enhancing them in the other. We use these photonic lattices to validate and benchmark the analytical predictions.

However, for wide scale adoption, improvements in the efficiency of hydrogen-to-electricity conversion are required. The kinetics of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the main bottleneck of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), hence development of new cathode materials is of paramount importance. Computational design of new catalysts can shorten the development time, but, due to the complexity of the ORR potential energy landscape, atomistic-level modeling of this processes is challenging. Moreover, the catalytic species may exhibit strong electronic correlations, which cannot be rigorously and accurately described with low-cost methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). Accurate ab-initio methods have been traditionally considered not applicable to such systems due to their high computational cost, but this soon may be possible thanks to the rapid advances in quantum computing. Here, we present the first classical/quantum computational study of the ORR on both pure platinum and platinum-capped cobalt surface and show the applicability of quantum computing methods to a complex catalysis problem. We show the feasibility of such a workflow implemented in InQuanto\\textsuperscript{(TM)} and demonstrate it on the H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer.

    "abstract": "The piecewise linearity condition on the total energy with respect to total magnetization of open quantum systems is derived, using the infinite-separation-limit technique. This generalizes the well known constancy condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density functional theory (DFT). The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans theorem is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy curve of a finite system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat plane-structure of the oxygen atom, as an example. A diverse set of tilted plane structures is shown to occur in d-orbital subspaces, depending on their chemical coordination. General occupancy-based expressions for total energies are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed degeneracies. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) is an emerging method used in place of quantum phase estimation for the early fault-tolerant era, where limited quantum circuit depth is available. In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions. ",

    "abstract": "In isolated nonlinear optical waveguide arrays with bounded energy spectrum, simultaneous conservation of energy and power of the optical modes enables study of coupled thermal and particle transport in the negative temperature regime. Here, based on exact numerical simulation and rationale from Landauer formalism, we predict generic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in such systems. This is rooted in the spectral decoupling of thermal and power current of optical modes, and their different temperature dependence. Our work extends the study of coupled thermal and particle transport into unprecedented regimes, not reachable in natural condensed matter and atomic gas systems. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the ground state and dynamics of one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) quantum droplets within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Stripe droplet patterns emerge for increasing SOC wavenumber possessing a flat-top background for larger particle number. The surface energy features a power-law decay with respect to interactions. At small SOC wavenumbers, a transition from Gaussian to flat-top droplets occurs for either larger atom number or reduced intercomponent attraction. The excitation spectrum demonstrates, for instance, droplet stability and an admixture of phonons and rotons at large atom numbers and SOC wavenumbers. Unstable parametric regions are attributed to the interplay of SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang energy contributions. Rich droplet dynamical features are found using velocity imprinting, and abrupt changes on the intercomponent interaction or the SOC parameters. Characteristic type of responses include, breathing oscillations, expansion, symmetric and asymmetric droplet fragmentation, admixtures of single and stripe droplet branches as well as erratic spatial distributions suggesting the triggering of relevant instabilities. Our results unveil the controlled dynamical generation and stability of stripe droplets that should be detectable in current cold-atom experiments. ",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of open quantum systems is formulated in a minimally extended state space comprising the degrees of freedom of a system of interest and a finite set of non-unitary, pure-state reservoir modes. This formal structure, derived from the Feynman-Vernon path integral for the reduced density, is shown to lead to an exact time-local evolution equation in a mixed Liouville-Fock space. The crucial ingredient is a mathematically consistent decomposition of the reservoir auto-correlation in terms of harmonic modes with complex-valued frequencies and amplitudes, which are obtained from any given spectral noise power of the physical reservoir. This formulation provides a universal framework to obtain a family of equivalent representations which are directly related to new and established schemes for efficient numerical simulations. By restricting some of the complex-valued mode parameters and performing linear transformations, we make connections to previous approaches, whose auxiliary degrees of freedom are thus revealed as restricted versions of the minimally extended state space presented here. From a practical perspective, the new framework offers a computational tool which combines numerical efficiency and accuracy with long time stability and broad applicability over the whole temperature range and also for strongly structured reservoir mode densities. It can thus deliver high precision data with modest computational resources and simulation times for actual quantum technological devices. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.
