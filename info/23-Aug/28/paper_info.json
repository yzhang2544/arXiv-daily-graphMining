    "abstract": "We have studied quantum systems on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and found that all these systems are connected through local transformations. Actually, we have shown that these transformations give rise to a gauge group that connects the Hamiltonian operators associated with each quantum system. This bridge allows us to connect different quantum systems, in such a way that studying one of them allows to understand the other through a gauge transformation. Furthermore, we included the case where the Hamiltonian operator can be time-dependent. An application for this construction will be achieved in the theory of control quantum systems. ",

    "title": "Neural networks in feedback for flow analysis, sensor placement and  control",
    "abstract": "This work presents a novel methodology for analysis and control of nonlinear fluid systems using neural networks. The approach is demonstrated on four different study cases being the Lorenz system, a modified version of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a streamwise-periodic 2D channel flow, and a confined cylinder flow. Neural networks are trained as models to capture the complex system dynamics and estimate equilibrium points through a Newton method, enabled by backpropagation. These neural network surrogate models (NNSMs) are leveraged to train a second neural network, which is designed to act as a stabilizing closed-loop controller. The training process employs a recurrent approach, whereby the NNSM and the neural network controller (NNC) are chained in closed loop along a finite time horizon. By cycling through phases of combined random open-loop actuation and closed-loop control, an iterative training process is introduced to overcome the lack of data near equilibrium points. This approach improves the accuracy of the models in the most critical region for achieving stabilization. Through the use of L1 regularization within loss functions, the NNSMs can also guide optimal sensor placement, reducing the number of sensors from an initial candidate set. The datasets produced during the iterative training process are also leveraged for conducting a linear stability analysis through a modified dynamic mode decomposition approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of computationally inexpensive neural networks in modeling, controlling, and enabling stability analysis of nonlinear systems, providing insights into the system behaviour and offering potential for stabilization of complex fluid systems.

    "title": "A Cryogenic Tune and Match Circuit for Magnetic Resonance Microscopy at  15.2T",
    "abstract": "Signal to noise ratios (SNR) in magnetic resonance microscopy images are limited by acquisition times and the decreasing number of spins in smaller voxels. Significant SNR gains from cooling of the RF receiver are only realized when the Johnson noise generated within the RF hardware is large compared to the electromagnetic noise produced by the sample. Cryogenic cooling of imaging probes is common in high field systems but proves difficult to insulate the sample from extreme temperatures. We designed a chamber to cool only the tune and match circuitry to show it is possible to achieve much of the available SNR gain available for cooled coils. We designed a microcoil circuit to resonate at 650 MHz for imaging on a 15.2 T scanner. Surface loops and solenoids of varying diameters were tested to determine the largest diameter coil that demonstrated significant SNR gains from cooling. A liquid N2 cryochamber was designed to cool the circuitry while leaving the RF coil in ambient air. As the cryochamber was filled with liquid N2, Q-factors were measured on the bench while monitoring the coil's surface temperature. Improvements of SNR on images of solutions were demonstrated via cooling the tune and match circuit in the magnet bore. At 650 MHz, loops and solenoids < 3 mm in diameter showed significant improvements in quality factor on the bench. The resistance of the variable capacitors and the coaxial cable were measured to be 45% and 32% of room temperature values near the Larmor frequency. Images obtained with a 2 turn, 3 mm diameter loop with the matching circuit at room temperature and then cooled with liquid nitrogen demonstrated SNR improvements of a factor of 2. By cooling the tune and match circuit and leaving the surface loop in ambient air, SNR was improved by a factor of 2. The results are significant because it allows for more space to insulate the sample from extreme temperatures. ",

In such a wiggler, the laser-accelerated electrons emit THz radiations with a period closely related to the plasma thickness. Theoretical model and numerical simulations predict a THz pulse with a laser-THz energy conversion over 2.0$\\%$, an ultra-strong field exceeding 80 GV/m, a divergence angle approximately 20$^\\circ$, and a center-frequency tunable from 4.4 to 1.5 THz, can be generated from a laser of 430 mJ.

The maximum energy gain in a single-stage LWFA is limited by dephasing, which occurs when the trapped particles outrun the accelerating phase of the wakefield. Here, we demonstrate that a single space-time structured laser pulse can be used for ionization injection and electron acceleration over many dephasing lengths in the bubble regime. Simulations of a dephasingless laser wakefield accelerator driven by a 6.2-J laser pulse show 25 pC of injected charge accelerated over 20 dephasing lengths (1.3 cm) to a maximum energy of 2.1 GeV. The space-time structured laser pulse features an ultrashort, programmable-trajectory focus. Accelerating the focus, reducing the focused spot-size variation, and mitigating unwanted self-focusing stabilize the electron acceleration, which improves beam quality and leads to projected energy gains of 125 GeV in a single, sub-meter stage driven by a 500-J pulse.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast science builds on dynamic compositions of precisely timed light pulses1 and evolving sequences of pulses are observed inside almost every mode-locked laser. However, the underlying physics remains barely controlled and utilized until now. Here, we demonstrate the fast and deterministic control of soliton motion for the generation of programmable ultrashort pulse patterns from a dual-comb mode-locked Er:fiber laser. Specifically, we harness intra-cavity modulation of individual solitons and their laser-intrinsic dynamics to facilitate the rapid tuning of two interlaced soliton combs. Upon extra-cavity temporal recombination of both combs, we obtain reconfigurable pulse patterns at arbitrary delays. Using high-throughput real-time spectral interferometry, we resolve the short-range inter-soliton motion upon external stimuli and we demonstrate the high-speed sweeping of picosecond pump-probe-delays and programmable free-form trajectories. This work introduces a novel approach to soliton control and paves the way for ultrafast instruments at unprecedented high tuning, cycling and acquisition speeds. ",

    "abstract": "Single photon emitters are core building blocks of quantum technologies, with established and emerging applications ranging from quantum computing and communication to metrology and sensing. Regardless of their nature, quantum emitters universally display fluorescence intermittency or photoblinking: interaction with the environment can cause the emitters to undergo quantum jumps between on and off states that correlate with higher and lower photoemission events, respectively. Understanding and quantifying the mechanism and dynamics of photoblinking is important for both fundamental and practical reasons. However, the analysis of blinking time traces is often afflicted by data scarcity. Blinking emitters can photo-bleach and cease to fluoresce over time scales that are too short for their photodynamics to be captured by traditional statistical methods. Here, we demonstrate two approaches based on machine learning that directly address this problem. We present a multi-feature regression algorithm and a genetic algorithm that allow for the extraction of blinking on/off switching rates with >85% accuracy, and with >10x less data and >20x higher precision than traditional methods based on statistical inference. Our algorithms effectively extend the range of surveyable blinking systems and trapping dynamics to those that would otherwise be considered too short-lived to be investigated. They are therefore a powerful tool to help gain a better understanding of the physical mechanism of photoblinking, with practical benefits for applications based on quantum emitters that rely on either mitigating or harnessing the phenomenon.

    "abstract": "A two-dimensional (2D) material, formed for example by a self-assembled molecular monolayer or by a single layer of a Van der Walls material, can couple efficiently with photonic nanocavities, potentially reaching the strong coupling regime. The coupling can be modelled using classical harmonic oscillator models or cavity quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians that often neglect the direct dipole-dipole interactions within the monolayer. Here, we diagonalize the full Hamiltonian of the system, including these direct dipole-dipole interactions. The main effect on the optical properties of a typical 2D system is simply to renormalize the effective energy of the bright collective excitation of the monolayer that couples with the nanophotonic mode. On the other hand, we show that for situations of extreme field confinement, large transition dipole moments and low losses, fully including the direct dipole-dipole interactions is critical to correctly capture the optical response, with many collective states participating in it. To quantify this result, we propose a simple equation that indicates the condition for which the direct interactions strongly modify the optical response. ",
