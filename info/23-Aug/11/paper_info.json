    "title": "Doppler-Enhanced Quantum Magnetometry with thermal Rydberg atoms",
    "abstract": "We report experimental measurements showing how one can combine quantum interference and thermal Doppler shifts at room temperature to detect weak magnetic fields. We pump ${}^{87}$Rb atoms to a highly-excited, Rydberg level using a probe and a coupling laser, leading to narrow transmission peaks of the probe due to destructive interference of transition amplitudes, known as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). While it is customary in such setups to use counterpropagating lasers to minimize the effect of Doppler shifts, here we show, on the contrary, that one can harness Doppler shifts in a copropagating arrangement to produce an enhanced response to a magnetic field. In particular, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude bigger splitting in the transmission spectrum as compared to the counterpropagating case. We explain and generalize our findings with theoretical modelling and simulations based on a Lindblad master equation. Our results pave the way to using quantum effects for magnetometry in readily deployable room-temperature platforms. ",

    "abstract": "Optics is an exciting route for the next generation of computing hardware for machine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity of an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary algorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the calculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for inference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation of backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the conflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear activation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time with a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed for the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved through a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as the pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog platforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the possibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical processes for both training and inference tasks.

    "abstract": "Understanding corneal stiffness is valuable for improving refractive surgery, detecting corneal abnormalities, and assessing intraocular pressure. However, accurately measuring the elastic properties, particularly the tensile and shear moduli that govern mechanical deformation, has been challenging. To tackle this issue, we have developed guided-wave optical coherence elastography that can simultaneously excite and analyze symmetric (S0) and anti-symmetric (A0) elastic waves in the cornea at frequencies around 10 kHz and allows us to extract tensile and shear properties from measured wave dispersion curves. By applying acoustoelastic theory that incorporates corneal tension and a nonlinear constitutive tissue model, we verified the technique using elastomer phantoms and ex vivo porcine corneas and investigated the dependence on intraocular pressure. For two healthy human subjects, we measured a mean tensile modulus of 3.6 MPa and a mean shear modulus of 76 kPa in vivo with estimated errors of < 4%. This technique shows promise for the quantitative biomechanical assessment of the cornea in a clinical setting. ",

    "abstract": "The control of light through all-optical means is a fundamental challenge in nanophotonics and a key effect in optical switching and logic. The optical bistability effect enables this control and can be observed in various planar photonic systems such as microdisk and photonic crystal cavities and waveguides. However, the recent advancements in flat optics with wavelength-thin optical elements require nonlinear elements based on metastructures and metasurfaces. The performance of these systems can be enhanced with high-Q bound states in the continuum (BIC), which leads to intense harmonic generation, improved light-matter coupling, and pushes forward sensing limits. In this study, we report on the enhanced thermo-optical nonlinearity and the observation of optical bistability in an all-dielectric metasurface membrane with BICs. Unlike many other nanophotonic platforms, metasurfaces allow for fine control of the quality factor of the BIC resonance by managing the radiative losses. This provides an opportunity to control the parameters of the observed hysteresis loop and even switch from bistability to optical discrimination by varying the angle of incidence. Additionally, we propose a mechanism of nonlinear critical coupling that establishes the conditions for maximal hysteresis width and minimal switching power, which has not been reported before. Our work suggests that all-dielectric metasurfaces supporting BICs can serve as a flat-optics platform for optical switching and modulation based on strong thermo-optical nonlinearity. ",

Here, we theoretically introduce a framework for the all-optical generation and control of freespace optical skyrmions in extreme ultraviolet regions via high harmonic generation. We show that by employing full Poincare beams, the created extreme ultraviolet fields manifest as skyrmionic structures in Stokes vector fields, whose skyrmion number is relevant to harmonic orders. We reveal that the generation of skyrmionics structure is attributed to spatial-resolved spin constraint of high harmonic generation. Through qualifying the geometrical parameters of full Poincar\\'e beams, the topological texture of extreme ultraviolet fields can be completely manipulated, generating the Bloch-type, Neel-type, anti-type, and higher-order skyrmions, etc. This work promotes the investigation of topological optics in optical highly nonlinear processes, with potential applications towards ultrafast spintronics with structured light fields.

At this irradiation wavelength, photo damage becomes detectable only after exceeding a specific peak intensity threshold, which is independent of the photon flux and irradiation time, distinguishing it from irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Furthermore, we investigate and quantify the role of excessive heat in reducing the damage threshold, particularly during high-repetition-rate operations, which are desirable for label-free and multi-dimensional microscopy techniques. To verify our findings, we examined cellular responses to tissue damage, including apoptosis and the recruitment of macrophages and fibroblasts at different time points post-irradiation. These findings substantially contribute to advancing the emerging nonlinear optical microscopy techniques and provide a strategy for inducing deep-tissue, precise and localized injuries using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses.

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical predictions hint at an implementation of a superradiant laser based on narrow optical clock transitions by using a filtered thermal beam at high density. Corresponding numerical studies give encouraging results but the required very high densities are sensitive to beam collimation errors and inhomogeneous shifts. Here we present extensive numerical studies of threshold conditions and the predicted output power of such a superradiant laser involving realistic particle numbers and velocities along the cavity axis. Detailed studies target the threshold scaling as a function of temperature as well as the influence of eliminating the hottest part of the atomic distribution via velocity filtering and the benefits of additional atomic beam guiding. Using a cumulant expansion approach allows us to quantify the significance of atom-atom and atom-field correlations in such configurations. We predict necessary conditions to achieve a certain threshold photon number depending on the atomic temperature and density. In particular, we show that the temperature threshold can be significantly increased by using more atoms. Interestingly, a velocity filter removing very fast atoms has only almost negligible influence despite their phase perturbing properties. On the positive side an additional conservative optical guiding towards cavity mode antinodes leads to significantly lower threshold and higher average photon number. Interestingly we see that higher order atom-field and direct atom-atom quantum correlations play only a minor role in the laser dynamics, which is a bit surprising in the superradiant regime. ",

X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and ultra-violet visible spectroscopy were used to explore the structural and optical properties of Mn3O4 thin films. XRD patterns and Raman spectra confirm the phase of all films as tetragonal. The average crystallite size of films increased from ~ 17 to ~ 25 nm with increasing coating layers. Optical properties such as band gap, skin depth, cutoff wavelength, excitation coefficient, refractive index, etc, have been studied in detail by using ultra-violet visible spectroscopy. The direct optical band gap and refractive index of fabricated films were decreased as increasing the coating layers of Mn3O4. The refractive index for 2 and 4 coating layers were decreased as increasing the incident wavelength. While for 6, 8, and 10 coating layers, the values of refractive index remain constant with respect to incident wavelength. The optical analyses suggest that prepared Mn3O4 thin films can be used as a potential candidate for optical semiconductor devices including photovoltaic cells and optical sensors. ",

In this work, we apply reinforcement learning to the preparation of an ultracold quantum gas to realize a consistent and large number of atoms at microkelvin temperatures. This reinforcement learning agent determines an optimal set of thirty control parameters in a dynamically changing environment that is characterized by thirty sensed parameters. By comparing this method to that of training supervised-learning regression models, as well as to human-driven control schemes, we find that both machine learning approaches accurately predict the number of cooled atoms and both result in occasional superhuman control schemes. However, only the reinforcement learning method achieves consistent outcomes, even in the presence of a dynamic environment. ",
