    "abstract": "The reconstruction of 3D cine-MRI is challenged by highly undersampled k-space data in each cine frame, due to the slow speed of MR signal acquisition. We proposed a machine learning-based framework, spatial and temporal implicit neural representation learning (STINR-MR), for accurate 3D cine-MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled data. STINR-MR used a joint reconstruction and deformable registration approach to address the ill-posed spatiotemporal reconstruction problem, by solving a reference-frame 3D MR image and a corresponding motion model which deforms the reference frame to each cine frame. The reference-frame image was reconstructed as a spatial implicit neural representation (INR) network, which learns the mapping from input 3D spatial coordinates to corresponding MR values. The dynamic motion model was constructed via a temporal INR, as well as basis deformation vector fields(DVFs) extracted from prior/onboard 4D-MRIs. The learned INR encodes input time points and outputs corresponding weighting factors to combine the basis DVFs into time-resolved motion fields. STINR-MR was evaluated using MR data simulated from the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) digital phantom and MR data acquired clinically from a healthy human subject. Its reconstruction accuracy was also compared with that of the model-based non-rigid motion estimation method (MR-MOTUS). STINR-MR can reconstruct 3D cine-MR images with high temporal (<100 ms) and spatial (3 mm) resolutions to accurately capture different irregular motion patterns. Compared with MR-MOTUS, STINR-MR consistently reconstructed images with better quality, fewer artifacts, and achieved superior tumor localization accuracy. STINR-MR provides a lightweight and efficient framework for accurate 3D cine-MRI reconstruction, and does not require external data for pre-training to avoid generalizability issues encountered in deep learning methods.

    "abstract": "Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials characterized by an insulting bulk and high mobility topologically protected surface states, making them promising candidates for future optoelectronic and quantum devices. Although their electronic and transport properties have been extensively studied, their optical properties and prospective photonic capabilities have not been fully uncovered. Here, we use a combination of far-field and near-field nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy, to study CVD grown Bi2Se3 nanobeams (NBs). We first extract the mid-infrared (MIR) optical constants of Bi2Se3, revealing refractive index values as high as n ~6.4, and demonstrate that the NBs support Mie-resonances across the MIR. Local near-field reflection phase mapping reveals domains of various phase shifts, providing information on the local optical properties of the NBs. We experimentally measure up to 2{\\pi} phase-shift across the resonance, in excellent agreement with FDTD simulations. This work highlights the potential of TI Bi2Se3 for quantum circuitry, non-linear generation, high-Q metaphotonics, and IR photodetection. ",

    "abstract": "Double Resonance is a powerful method spectroscopic method that provides an unambiguous assignment of the rigorous quantum numbers of one state of a transition. However, there is often ambiguity as to the branch ($\\Delta J$) of the transition. The dependence of the intensity of the double resonance signal on the relative polarization of pump and probe radiation can be used to resolve this ambiguity and has been used for this in the past. However, the published theoretical predictions for this ratio are based upon a weak (i.e. non-saturating) field approximation. In this paper, we present theoretical predictions for these intensity ratios for cases where the pump field is strongly saturating, in the two limits of transitions dominated by homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. While saturation, as can be expected, reduces the magnitude of the polarization effect (driving the intensity ratio closer to unity), polarization anisotropy remains even with a strongly saturating probe field in most cases. For the case of an inhomogeneously broadened line, as when Doppler broadening linewidth dominates over even the power broadened homogeneous line width, a large fraction of the low pump power anisotropy remains. Results are presented for both the case of linear and circular pump and probe field polarizations. The present predictions are compared with experimental measurements on CH$_4$ ground state $\\rightarrow \\nu_3 \\rightarrow 3\\nu_3$ transitions recently reported by de Oliveira et al and found to be in better agreement than the weak field predictions.

    "abstract": "To achieve the true diffraction-limited emittance of a storage ring light source, such as ~10 pm.rad for medium-energy electron beams, within a limited circumference, it is generally necessary to increase the number of bending magnets in a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice, as in the future upgrade plan of MAX IV with a 19BA replacing the current 7BA. However, this comes with extremely strong quadrupole and sextupole magnets and very limited space. The former can result in very small vacuum chambers, increasing the coupling impedance and thus enhancing the beam instabilities, and the latter can pose significant challenges in accommodating the necessary diagnostics and vacuum components. Inspired by the hybrid MBA lattice concept, in this paper we propose a new unit lattice concept called the complex unit lattice cell, which can reduce the magnet strengths and also save space. The complex unit cell is numerically studied using a simplified model. Then as an example, a 17BA lattice based on the complex unit cell concept is designed for a 3 GeV storage ring light source with a circumference of 537.6 m, which has a natural emittance of 19.3 pm.rad. This 17BA lattice is also compared with the 17BA lattice designed with conventional unit cells to showcase the benefits of the complex unit cell concept. This 17BA lattice also suggests a new type of MBA lattice, which we call the MBA lattice with semi-distributed chromatic correction. ",

Here, we have investigated strong resonant photon-magnon coupling at frequencies above 1 terahertz for the first time in a prototypical room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator, NiO, inside a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. The cavity was formed by the crystal itself when it was thinned down to an optimized thickness. By using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in high magnetic fields up to 25 T, we swept the magnon frequency through Fabry-P\\'erot cavity modes and observed photon-magnon anticrossing behavior, demonstrating clear vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding the polariton linewidths. These results show that NiO is a promising platform for exploring antiferromagnetic spintronics and cavity magnonics in the terahertz frequency range. ",

    "abstract": "The field of quantum technology has been rapidly expanding in the past decades, yielding numerous applications as quantum information, quantum communication and quantum cybersecurity. The central building block for these applications is a quantum emitter (QE), a controllable source of single photons or photon pairs. Semiconductor QEs such as perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been demonstrated to be a promising material for pure single-photon emission, and their hybrids with plasmonic nanocavities may serve as sources of photon pairs. Here we have designed a system in which individual quantum emitters and their ensembles can be traced before, during, and after the interaction with the external plasmonic metasurface in controllable way. Upon coupling the external plasmonic metasurface to the array of QEs, the individual QEs switch from single-photon to photon-pair emission mode. Remarkably, this method does not affect the chemical structure and composition of the QEs, allowing them to return to their initial state after decoupling from the plasmonic metasurface. By employing this approach, we have successfully demonstrated the reversible switching of the ensemble of individual semiconductor QEs between single-photon and photon pair emission modes. This significantly broadens the potential applications of semiconductor QEs in quantum technologies. ",

Due to this, many new educational courses and programs are needed in order to prepare a workforce for the developing industry. Owing to its specialist nature, teaching approaches in this field can suffer from being disconnected to the substantial degree of science education research which aims to support the best approaches to teaching in STEM fields. In order to connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we have generated an innovative approach, the Quantum Curriculum Transformation Framework (QCTF), intended to provide a didactical perspective on the creation and transformation of quantum technologies curricula. For this, we propose a decision tree consisting of four steps: 1. choose a topic, 2. choose one or more targeted skills, 3. choose a learning goal and 4. choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way, educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST, as the need for high quality education in this field continues to grow.

In contrast to the existing WPT solutions, our approach does not require additional transmitting coils. Compared to the energy harvesting, the proposed method allows supplying significantly more power. We perform numerical simulations demonstrating that one can use the fundamental mode of the birdcage coil to perform a scanning procedure while transmitting the energy to the receiver at a higher-order mode without any interference with the scanning signal or violation of safety constraints, as guaranteed by the mode structure of the birdcage. Also, we evaluate the specific absorption rate along with the energy transfer efficiency and verify our numerical model by a direct comparison with an experimental setup featuring a birdcage coil of a 1.5T MRI scanner.

This article delves into the value of acoustic metamaterials in room acoustics, particularly in small room acoustics that poses specific challenges due to their significant cavity resonant nature. Small rooms usually exhibit an inhomogeneous frequency response spectrum, requiring higher wall absorption with specific spectrum to achieve a uniform acoustic environment, i.e., a constant reverberation time over a wide audible frequency band. To tackle this issue, we developed a design that simultaneously incorporates numerous subwavelength acoustic resonators at different frequencies to achieve customized broadband absorption for the walls of a specific example room. The on-site experimental measurements agree well with the numerical predictions, attesting to the robustness of the design and method. The proposed method of reverse-engineering metamaterials by targeting specific acoustic requirements has broad applicability and unique advantages in small confined spaces with high acoustic requirements, such as recording studios, listening rooms, and car cabins.

While algorithmic solutions are effective, their computational efficiency diminishes with increasing problem complexity. Photonic accelerators, leveraging temporal and spatial-temporal chaos, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, despite these advancements, current approaches either compromise computation speed or amplify system complexity. In this paper, we introduce a chaotic microresonator frequency comb (chaos comb) to tackle the MAB problem, where each comb mode is assigned to a slot machine. Through a proof-of-concept experiment, we employ 44 comb modes to address an MAB with 44 slot machines, demonstrating performance competitive with both conventional software algorithms and other photonic methods. Further, the scalability of decision making is explored with up to 512 slot machines using experimentally obtained temporal chaos in different time slots. Power-law scalability is achieved with an exponent of 0.96, outperforming conventional software-based algorithms. Moreover, we find that a numerically calculated chaos comb accurately reproduces experimental results, paving the way for discussions on strategies to increase the number of slot machines. ",

Here, utilizing a stepped cesium atomic-vapor cell with five different dimensions at the same atomic population density and buffer gas pressure, the height and full width at half maximum of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency(EIT) signal, and the sensitivity of the atomic superheterodyne sensor are comprehensively investigated at the same Rabi frequences(saturated laser power) conditions.

Based on the coherent integration signal theory and atomic linear expansion coefficient method, theoretical analysis of the EIT height and sensitivity are further investigated. The results could shed new light on the understanding and design of ultrahigh-sensitivity Rydberg atomic microwave sensors and find promising applications in quantum measurement, communication, and imaging.

The PS/MACE+EC sample's thermophysical properties exhibited higher values than both the PS/EC and PS/MACE. The energy activity associated with the process of water splitting on the surface of porous silicon (PS) formed by the metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) combined with the electrochemical etching (EC) method is found to be more significant compared to the PS samples prepared using only EC or MACE techniques. The combined MACE/EC method is considered the most effective technique for obtaining PS with a nanoporous silicon surface, which has the highest energy activity in water-splitting processes. The activation energy required for water splitting, denoted as Ea (PS/MACE+EC), exhibits a higher value compared to the activation energies observed for the Ea (PS/EC) and Ea (PS/MACE) samples. The inclusion of nickel (Ni) particles within the pores of porous silicon (PS<Ni>) serves to stabilize the thermophysical properties of the material. Consequently, this prevents substantial alterations in the thermal characteristics of PS<Ni> compared to PS without nickel in its pores. The samples containing nickel (PS/MACE) and PS/MACE+EC exhibit long-term preservation of their energy activity (Ea) for one year. This phenomenon occurs due to the presence of nickel-containing nanopores within the samples.

The realization of higher dimensional spin models offers new opportunities ranging from studying topological phases of matter or quantum spin glasses to future fault-tolerant quantum computation. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum State Tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique in Quantum Information Processing (QIP) for reconstructing unknown quantum states. However, the conventional QST methods are limited by the number of measurements required, which makes them impractical for large-scale quantum systems. To overcome this challenge, we propose the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques to enhance the efficiency of QST. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into various approaches for QST, encompassing both classical and quantum methodologies; We also implement different QML approaches for QST and demonstrate their effectiveness on various simulated and experimental quantum systems, including multi-qubit networks. Our results show that our QML-based QST approach can achieve high fidelity (98%) with significantly fewer measurements than conventional methods, making it a promising tool for practical QIP applications.

    "abstract": "Tensor networks have historically proven to be of great utility in providing compressed representations of wave functions that can be used for calculation of eigenstates. Recently, it has been shown that a variety of these networks can be leveraged to make real time non-equilibrium simulations of dynamics involving the Feynman-Vernon influence functional more efficient. In this work, tensor networks are utilized for calculating equilibrium correlation function for open quantum systems using the path integral methodology. These correlation functions are of fundamental importance in calculations of rates of reactions, simulations of response functions and susceptibilities, spectra of systems, etc. The influence of the solvent on the quantum system is incorporated through an influence functional, whose unconventional structure motivates the design of a new optimal matrix product-like operator that can be applied to the so-called path amplitude matrix product state. This complex time tensor network path integral approach provides an exceptionally efficient representation of the path integral enabling simulations for larger systems strongly interacting with baths and at lower temperatures out to longer time. The design and implementation of this method is discussed along with illustrations from rate theory, symmetrized spin correlation functions, dynamical susceptibility calculations and quantum thermodynamics.

On the other hand, semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, including MoS$_2$, also exhibit strong excitonic effects, attributed to enhanced Coulomb interactions. This study investigates excitonic interactions between surface GaN quantum well (QW) and 2D MoS$_2$ in van der Waals heterostructures by varying the spacing between these two excitonic systems. Optical property investigation first demonstrates the effective passivation of defect states at the GaN surface through MoS$_2$ coating. Furthermore, a strong interplay is observed between MoS$_2$ monolayers and GaN QW excitonic transitions. This highlights the interest of the 2D material/III-nitride QW system to study near-field interactions, such as F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer, which could open up novel optoelectronic devices based on such hybrid excitonic structures.

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) provides a lucrative platform to determine molecular energetics in near-term quantum devices. While the VQE is traditionally tailored to determine the ground state wavefunction with the underlying Rayleigh-Ritz principle, the access to specific symmetry-adapted excited states remains elusive. This often requires high depth circuit or additional ancilla qubits along with prior knowledge of the ground state wavefunction. We propose a unified VQE framework that treats the ground and excited states in the same footings. With the knowledge of the irreducible representations of the spinorbitals, we construct a multi-determinantal reference that is adapted to a given spatial symmetry where additionally, the determinants are entangled through appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to ensure the desired spin-multiplicity. We introduce the notion of totally symmetric, spin-scalar unitary which maintains the purity of the reference at each step of the optimization. The state-selectivity safeguards the method against any variational collapse while leading to any targeted low-lying eigenroot of arbitrary symmetry. The direct access to the excited states shields our approach from the cumulative error that plagues excited state calculations in a quantum computer and with few parameter count, it is expected to be realized in near-term quantum devices.

    "abstract": "Gravity simulators offer the prospect of emulating quantum field dynamics on curved spacetime, including that of a black hole, in tabletop experiments. Since black holes in nature spin, to simulate a realistic black hole we must be able to achieve rotation - crucially requiring a set-up with at least 2+1 dimensions. Here, we report on the realisation of a draining flow of superfluid helium, with the most extensive stable vortex structures ever observed in a quantum fluid. Our non-contact 3-D measurement technique visualises micrometre-scale interface waves on the superfluid vortex flow, uncovering novel wave-vortex interactions, such as intricate patterns like bound states, and even, potentially, black hole ringdown signatures. This novel approach provides an arena to explore quantum-to-classical vortex flow transitions and develop finite temperature quantum field theory simulators for rotating curved spacetimes. ",
