    "abstract": "Chip-scale multimode optomechanical systems have unique benefits for sensing, metrology and quantum technologies relative to their single-mode counterparts. Slot-mode optomechanical crystals enable sideband resolution and large optomechanical couplings of a single optical cavity to two microwave-frequency mechanical modes. Still, previous implementations have been limited to nanobeam geometries, whose effective quantum cooperativity at ultralow temperatures is limited by their low thermal conductance. In this work, we design and experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional mechanical-optical-mechanical (MOM) platform that dispersively couples a slow-light slot-guided photonic-crystal waveguide mode and two slow-sound $\\sim 7$ GHz phononic wire modes localized in physically distinct regions. We first demonstrate optomechanical interactions in long waveguide sections, unveiling acoustic group velocities below 800 m/s, and then move on to mode-gap adiabatic heterostructure cavities with a tailored mechanical frequency difference. Through optomechanical spectroscopy, we demonstrate optical quality factors $Q \\sim 10^5$, vacuum optomechanical coupling rates, $g_o/2\\pi$, of 1.5 MHz and dynamical backaction effects beyond the single-mode picture. At larger power and adequate laser-cavity detuning, we demonstrate regenerative optomechanical oscillations involving a single mechanical mode, extending to both mechanical modes through modulation of the input laser drive at their frequency difference. This work constitutes an important advance towards engineering MOM systems with nearly degenerate mechanical modes as part of hybrid multipartite quantum systems. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the amplitude modulation of acoustic waves in accelerating flows, a problem that is still not fully understood, but essential to many technical applications, ranging from medical imaging to acoustic remote sensing. The proposed modeling framework is based on a convective form of the Kuznetsov equation, which incorporates the background flow field and is solved numerically by a finite-difference method. Using acoustic black and white hole analogues as model systems, we identify a modulation of the wave amplitude, that is shown to be driven by the divergence/convergence of the acoustic wave characteristics in an accelerating/decelerating flow, and which is distinct from the convective amplification accompanying an acoustic emitter moving at a constant velocity. To rationalize the observed amplitude modulation, a leading-order model is derived from first principles, leveraging a similarity of the wave characteristics and the wave amplitude with respect to a modified Helmholtz number. This leading-order model may serve as a basis for the numerical prediction and analysis of the behavior of acoustic waves in accelerating flows, by taking advantage of the notion that any accelerating flow field can be described locally as a virtual acoustic black or white hole.

    "abstract": "There has been a resurgence of interest in optical computing over the past decade, both in academia and in industry, with much of the excitement centered around special-purpose optical computers for neural-network processing. Optical computing has been a topic of periodic study for over 50 years, including for neural networks three decades ago, and a wide variety of optical-computing schemes and architectures have been proposed. In this paper we provide a systematic explanation of why and how optics might be able to give speed or energy-efficiency benefits over electronics for computing, enumerating 11 features of optics that can be harnessed when designing an optical computer. One often-mentioned motivation for optical computing -- that the speed of light $c$ is fast -- is not a key differentiating physical property of optics for computing; understanding where an advantage could come from is more subtle. We discuss how gaining an advantage over state-of-the-art electronic processors will likely only be achievable by careful design that harnesses more than one of the 11 features, while avoiding a number of pitfalls that we describe.

After this breakthrough discovery, demonstrating that diamond can be growth at low pressure and temperature, the progress quickly curbed and synthetic single crystal diamond (SCD) size and quality could not be improved toward attaining requirements critical in solid-state electronics. This led to the early promise of MPACVD to not come true and slowed the level of investments, thereby further stalling the progress in diamond syntheses.

A robust source for $^{224}$Ra atoms, 3.6 day half-life, was realized with an effusive oven containing $^{228}$Th, 1.9 year half-life, which continuously generates $^{224}$Ra via its $\\alpha$-decay. We characterized the efficacy of this source and found that after depleting built up radium the thorium decay provides a continuous source of radium atoms suitable for ion trapping. The vacuum system has been sealed for more than six months and continues to trap ions on demand. We also report a measurement of the $^{224}$Ra $7s^2\\ ^1$S$_0 \\rightarrow 7s7p\\ ^1$P$_1$ transition frequency: 621 043 830(60) MHz, which is helpful for efficient photoionization.

The potential of computational cardiac mechanics, however, has not yet been fully leveraged due to the heart's complex physiology and limitations in the non-invasive in vivo characterisation of heart properties necessary required for accurate patient-specific modelling such as the heart anatomy in an unloaded state, ventricular pressure, the elastic constitutive parameters and the myocardial muscle fibre orientation distribution. From a solid mechanics point of view without prior knowledge of the unloaded heart configuration and the cavity pressure-volume evolution, in particular, the constitutive parameters cannot be accurately estimated to describe the highly nonlinear elastic material behaviour of myocardial tissue. Here, knowledge of the volume-normalized end-diastolic pressure relation for larger mammals is exploited in combination with a novel iterative inverse parameter optimisation framework to determine end-systolic and end diastolic pressures, ventricular wall pre-straining and pre-stressing due the residual end-systolic cavity pressure as well as myocardial tissue stiffness parameters for biventricular heart models.

    "abstract": "The quantum Zeno effect refers to slowing down of the decay of a quantum system that is affected by frequent measurements. Nowadays, the significance of this paradigm is extended far beyond quantum systems, where it was introduced, finding physical and mathematical analogies in such phenomena as the suppression of output beam decay by sufficiently strong absorption introduced in guiding optical systems. In the latter case, the effect is often termed as macroscopic Zeno effect. Recent studies in optics, where enhanced transparency of the entire system was observed upon the increase of the absorption, were largely focused on the systems obeying parity-time symmetry, hence, the observed effect was attributed to the symmetry breaking. While manifesting certain similarities in the behavior of the transparency of the system with the mentioned studies, the macroscopic Zeno phenomenon reported here in topological photonic system is far more general in nature. In particular, we show that it does not require the existence of exceptional points, and that it is based on the suppression of decay for only a subspace of modes that can propagate in the system, alike the quantum Zeno dynamics. By introducing controlled losses in one of the arms of a topological insulator comprising two closely positioned Su-Schrieffer-Heeger arrays, we demonstrate the macroscopic Zeno effect, which manifests itself in an increase of the transparency of the system with respect to the topological modes created at the interface between two arrays. The phenomenon remains robust against disorder in the non-Hermitian topological regime. In contrast, coupling a topological array with a non-topological one results in a monotonic decrease in output power with increasing absorption. ",

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (i) VQE with the standard heuristic ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (ii) When the parameters are optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (iii) QAOA becomes practical when supplemented with a physically-inspired initialization of the parameters. Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters initialization. ",

    "abstract": "The dissipative character of an electromagnetic medium breaks the unitary evolution structure that is present in lossless media, both dispersive and optical. In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schrodinger representation of Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an $r$-dimensional subspace. Trotterization of the evolution enables us to isolate the non-unitary part associated with dissipation from the unitary part that corresponds to the lossless case. Given the fact that the unitary part can be implemented on $n$ qubits based on the discretization and the dimensionality of the pertinent fields we propose two dilation techniques for handling the dissipative evolution part. Our first algorithm is based on realization of dissipation as a quantum amplitude channel where an unspecified environment interacts with the lossless system and produces the non-unitary evolution. Therefore, the combined system-environment is now closed and evolves unitary. This physical unitary dilation process requires only one ancillary qubit as environment resulting in a scaling of $\\textit{O}(2^{n-1}n^2)$ elementary gates, in the implementation of the total system-environment unitary evolution operator. On the other hand, by treating the non-unitary part with the LCU method, exploiting the diagonal structure of dissipation, we obtain an optimized counterpart for the previous result. The non-unitary part can now be implemented in $\\textit{O}(2^{n})$ elementary gates. Under the light of our results, a full-wave quantum simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering in complex media is deemed possible in the near future. ",

The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for space division multiplexing optical fiber communication, which can serve as a robust channel for high-dimensional quantum communication. To test the channel, we perform a quantum communication task in the prepare-and-measure scenario. The non-Markovian nature of the system is demonstrated by implementing a Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of the phase noise in multi-core fibers could improve the stability and quality of several real-world communication protocols since they are a prime candidate to increase the telecom data transmission rate worldwide.

However, birefringence of such materials could degrade the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, not only because it can introduce optical losses, but also because its fluctuations create extra phase noise in the arm cavity reflected beam. In this paper, we analytically estimate the effects of birefringence and its fluctuations in the mirror substrate and coating for gravitational wave detectors. Our calculations show that the requirements for the birefringence fluctuations in silicon substrate and AlGaAs coating will be in the order of $10^{-8}$ rad/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ and $10^{-10}$ rad/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ at 100~Hz, respectively, for future gravitational wave detectors.

This necessitates an optical component, which can make different frequencies talk with each other. This component should be integrable into PCs and be controlled -- preferably -- by voltage for programmable generation of multifrequency quantum states and PQCs. Here, we propose a device that controls a four-wave mixing process, essential for frequency combs. We utilize nonlinear Fano resonances. Entanglement generated by the device can be tuned continuously by the applied voltage which can be delivered to the device via nm-thick wires.
