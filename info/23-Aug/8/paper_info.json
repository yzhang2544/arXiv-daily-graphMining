    "abstract": "We analyze the non-Fourier dual-phase-lag heat conduction process in a three-dimensional medium heated by a moving circular or annular laser beam, which is modeled by a set of point heat sources in the cross-section. In order to solve the model, Green's function approach is first used to obtain an analytical solution for the temperature distribution over the medium subjected to a single point heat source. Then the temperature distribution on the medium subjected to the laser beam can be obtained by the superposition method. According to this solution, the dependence between the heat conduction process and the cross-section of the heat source is investigated. Based on the comparison of the temperature distribution of the medium under Fourier's law and non-Fourier's law, the effect of the phase lag parameter is revealed. In addition, the effects of laser spot size and laser moving speed on the temperature distribution are also analyzed. The discovered properties provide theoretical support for the application of moving laser heat sources in various fields under the dual-phase-lag model. ",

    "abstract": "The mode profile of a coupled optical cavity often exhibits a resonant doublet, which arises from the strong coupling between its sub-cavities. Traditional readout methods rely on setting fields of different frequencies to be resonant in either sub-cavity, which is challenging in the case of strong coupling. In this regime, the coupled cavity behaves as a single resonator, and a field must be resonant in all its parts. Consequently, specialized sensing schemes are necessary to control strongly coupled cavities. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique for the relative measurement of the degrees of freedom of a strongly coupled cavity. Our approach enables simultaneous frequency stabilization and fine-tuning of frequency splitting in the resonant doublet. Overall, our proposed technique offers a promising solution to control the properties of coupled cavities, facilitating advanced applications in the fields of gravitational-wave detection, quantum cavity optomechanics, and other related areas.

    "abstract": "Plasmonic antennas, leveraging localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), hold significant promise for efficiently trapping nanoscale particles at low power levels. However, their effectiveness is hindered by photothermal effects in metallic nanoparticles, leading to repulsive thermophoretic forces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines depletion attraction and photothermal effects inherent in plasmonic structures, capitalizing on thermally induced concentration gradients. Through the thermophoretic depletion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules around plasmonic hotspots, we create sharp concentration gradients, enabling precise localization of nanoscopic particles through a synergistic effect with diffusophoretic forces. In our experiments, we successfully demonstrate the trapping and dynamic 2D manipulation of 100 nm polystyrene beads, showcasing the platform's potential for colloidal assembly at the nanoscale. Remarkably, this method maintains highly stable trapping performance even at an incredibly low 2.5 mW laser power, rendering it particularly appealing for applications involving biological species. Our study introduces a promising avenue for the precise and efficient manipulation of sub-nanoscale particles, with wide-ranging implications in nanotechnology, biophysics, and nanomedicine. This research opens up new opportunities for advancing nanoscale particle studies and applications, ushering in a new era of nanoscale manipulation techniques. ",

This paper demonstrates a novel approach to fabricating TCEs that effectively alleviates this trade-off: a monolithic GaAs high contrast grating integrated with metal (metalMHCG). The metalMHCG enables higher electrical conductivity than other TCEs, while providing transmissive and antireflective properties. We focus on infrared spectrum TCEs, which are essential for sensing, thermal imaging, and automotive applications. However, due to elevated free carrier absorption they are much more demanding than TCEs for the visible spectrum. We demonstrate 75% absolute transmittiance of unpolarized light, resulting in 108% transmittance relative to plain GaAs substrate. We achieved even larger absolute transmittance of polarized light, reaching 92% or 133% relative transmittance. Despite record high transmittance, the sheet resistance of the metalMHCG is several times lower than any other TCE, ranging from 0.5 to 1 Ohm/Sq. ",

    "abstract": "With the practical efficiency of the silicon photovoltaic (PV) cell approaching its theoretical limit, pushing conversion efficiencies even higher now relies on reducing every type of power loss that can occur within the device. Limiting optical losses is therefore critical and requires effective management of incident photons in terms of how they interact with the device. Ultimately, photon management within a PV cell means engineering the device and constituent materials to maximize photon absorption within the active semiconductor and therefore reduce the number of photons lost through other means, most notably reflection and parasitic absorption. There have been great advancements in the front and the rear side photon management techniques in recent years. This review aims to discuss these advancements and compare the various approaches, not only in terms of increases in photogenerated current, but also their compatibility with different PV cell architectures and potential trade-offs, like increased surface recombination or scalability for high-volume manufacturing. In this review, a comprehensive discussion of a wide variety of the front and the rear side photon management structures are presented with suggestions to improve the already achieved performance further. This review is unique because it not only presents the recent development in photon management techniques, but also offer through analysis of these techniques and pathways to improve further. ",

    "abstract": "Photons can undergo spin-orbit coupling, by which the polarization (spin) and spatial profile (orbit) of the electromagnetic field interact and mix. Strong photonic spin-orbit coupling may reportedly arise from light propagation confined in a small cross-section, where the optical modes feature spin-orbit entanglement. However, while photonic Hamiltonians generally exhibit nonlinearity, the role and implication of spin-orbit entanglement in nonlinear optics have received little attention and are still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where spin-orbit entanglement facilitates spin-to-orbit transfer among different optical frequencies. By pumping a multimode optical nanofiber with a spin-polarized Gaussian pump beam, we produce an optical vortex at the third harmonic, which has long been regarded as a forbidden process in isotropic media. Our findings offer a unique and powerful means for efficient optical vortex generation that only incorporates a single Gaussian pump beam, in sharp contrast to any other approaches employing structured pump fields or sophisticatedly designed media. Our work opens up new possibilities of spin-orbit-coupling subwavelength waveguides, inspiring fundamental studies of nonlinear optics involving various types of structured light, as well as paving the way for the realization of hybrid quantum systems comprised of telecom photonic networks and long-lived quantum memories.

Multispectral QPI measures quantitative phase information across multiple spectral bands, permitting the examination of wavelength-specific phase and dispersion characteristics of samples. Here, we present the design of a diffractive processor that can all-optically perform multispectral quantitative phase imaging of transparent phase-only objects in a snapshot. Our design utilizes spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate diffractive multispectral processors to simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral bands in the visible spectrum. These diffractive multispectral processors maintain uniform performance across all the wavelength channels, revealing a decent QPI performance at each target wavelength. The generalization of these diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen objects, including thin Pap smear images. Due to its all-optical processing capability using passive dielectric diffractive materials, this diffractive multispectral QPI processor offers a compact and power-efficient solution for high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy and spectroscopy.

Here, we propose a multicore fibre-based pH system for in-situ pH mapping with tens of micrometer spatial resolution in microfluidic devices. The demonstration uses custom laser-manufactured glass microfluidic devices (called further micromodels) consisting of two round ports. The micromodels comprise two lintels for the injection of various pH buffers and an outlet. The two-port system facilitates the injection of various pH solutions using independent pressure pumps. The multicore fibre imaging system provides spatial information about the pH environment from the intensity distribution of fluorescence emission from the sensor attached to the fibre end facet, making use of the cores in the fibre as independent measurement channels. As a proof-of-concept, we performed pH measurements in micromodels through obstacles (glass and rock beads), showing that the particle features can be clearly distinguishable from the intensity distribution from the fibre sensor.

    "abstract": "The demand for higher data rates in next-generation mobile wireless communication systems (6G) has led to significant interest in terahertz (THz) waves as a high-frequency, broad modulation bandwidth carrier wave. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a wireless data transfer in the 560-GHz band using low-phase-noise THz waves generated by photomixing of a pair of distributed feedback lasers injection-locking to Kerr micro-resonator soliton comb. Experimental results showed near-error-free on-off keying (OOK) data transfer at 1 Gbit/s in the 560-GHz band, with a Q-factor of 6.23, surpassing the error-free limit. Also, modulation formats of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) were successfully used, showing clear constellation diagrams and relatively low root mean squared error vector magnitude (rms EVM) values of 23.9% and 23.6%, respectively. Moreover, data transfer at 0.4 Gbit/s in 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) demonstrated clear isolated symbols and achieved a low rms EVM value of 8.1%, complying with the IEEE 802.15.3d standard amendment. These demonstrations highlight the potential of using injection-locked DFB lasers with the Kerr micro-resonator soliton comb to achieve high-quality, high-speed wireless data transfer in the 560-GHz band. These findings contribute significantly to the advancement of wireless communication technology in the THz frequency range and pave the way for the realization of 6G wireless communication systems.

By introducing a compatible filtering mechanism based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) effect into a typical Phase-shifted grating Bragg fiber (PS-FBG) notch filtering cavity, dual mode-selection mechanisms which have independent frequency and time tuning mechanism can be constructed. By regulating three controllers, the proposed scheme can work in different states, named mode 1, mode 2 and mode 3. At mode 1 state, a dual single-frequency hopping signals is achieved with 50 ns hopping speed and flexible central frequency and pulse duration ratio. The mode 2 state is realized by applying the Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) technology into the proposed optoelectrical oscillator, in which dual coherent pulsed single-frequency signal and broadband signal is generated simultaneously. The adjustability of the time duration of the single-frequency signal and the bandwidth of the broadband signal are shown and discussed. The mode 3 state is a dual broadband signal generator which is realized by injecting a triangular wave into the signal laser. The detection performance of the generated broadband signals has also been evaluated by the pulse compression and the phase noise figure. The proposed method may provide a multifunctional radar system signal generator based on the simply external controllers, which can realize low-phase-noise or multifunctional detection with high resolution imaging ability, especially in a complex interference environment.

Several independent implementations of MBD with varying degree of functionality exist across a number of electronic structure codes, which both limits the current users of those codes and complicates dissemination of new variants of MBD. Here, we develop and document libMBD, a library implementation of MBD that is functionally complete, efficient, easy to integrate with any electronic structure code, and already integrated in FHI-aims, DFTB+, VASP, Q-Chem, CASTEP, and Quantum ESPRESSO. libMBD is written in modern Fortran with bindings to C and Python, uses MPI/ScaLAPACK for parallelization, and implements MBD for both finite and periodic systems, with analytical gradients with respect to all input parameters. The computational cost has asymptotic cubic scaling with system size, and evaluation of gradients only changes the prefactor of the scaling law, with libMBD exhibiting strong scaling up to 256 processor cores. Other MBD properties beyond energy and gradients can be calculated with libMBD, such as the charge-density polarization, first-order Coulomb correction, the dielectric function, or the order-by-order expansion of the energy in the dipole interaction. Calculations on supramolecular complexes with MBD-corrected electronic structure methods and a meta-review of previous applications of MBD demonstrate the broad applicability of the libMBD package to treat vdW interactions.

The experimental results demonstrate a remarkable agreement with the theoretical curve for the voltage at the resistor and the resonance frequency, validating the accuracy of the smartphone-based setup. The experiment fills the gap in educational materials related to electrical circuits and provides a portable alternative to traditional, expensive laboratory equipment. ",

    "title": "Colliding of two high Mach-number quantum degenerate plasma jets",
    "abstract": "Colliding of two high Mach-number quantum degenerate plasmas is one of the most essential components in the double-cone ignition (DCI) inertial confinement fusion scheme, in which two highly compressed plasma jets from the cone-tips collide along with rapid conversion from the colliding kinetic energies to the internal energy of a stagnated isochoric plasma. Due to the effects of high densities and high Mach-numbers of the colliding plasma jets, quantum degeneracy and kinetic physics might play important roles and challenge the predictions of traditional hydrodynamic models. In this work, the colliding process of two high Mach number quantum degenerate Deuterium-plasma jets with sizable scale ($\\sim 1000\\ \\si{\\mu m}$, $\\sim 300\\ \\si{ps}$, $\\sim 100\\ \\si{g/cc}$, $\\sim 300\\ \\si{km/s}$) were investigated with first-principle kinetic simulations and theoretical analyses. In order to achieve high-density compression, the colliding kinetic pressure should be significantly higher than the pressure raised by the quantum degeneracy. This means high colliding Mach numbers are required. However, when the Mach number is further increased, we surprisingly found a decreasing trend of density compression, due to kinetic effects. It is therefore suggested that there is theoretically optimal colliding velocity to achieve the highest density compression. Our results would provide valuable suggestions for the base-line design of the DCI experiments and also might be of relevance in some violent astrophysical processes, such as the merger of two white dwarfs.

    "title": "Terahertz Twistoptics -- engineering canalized phonon polaritons",
    "abstract": "The terahertz (THz) frequency range is key to study collective excitations in many crystals and organic molecules. However, due to the large wavelength of THz radiation, the local probing of these excitations in smaller crystalline structures or few-molecular arrangements, requires sophisticated methods to confine THz light down to the nanometer length scale, as well as to manipulate such a confined radiation. For this purpose, in recent years, taking advantage of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhP) in highly anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials has emerged as a promising approach, offering a multitude of manipulation options such as control over the wavefront shape and propagation direction. Here, we demonstrate the first THz application of twist-angle-induced HPhP manipulation, designing the propagation of confined THz radiation between 8.39 and 8.98\\,THz in the vdW material alpha-molybdenum trioxide ({\\alpha}-MoO\\textsubscript{3}), hence extending twistoptics to this intriguing frequency range. Our images, recorded by near-field optical microscopy, show the frequency- and twist-angle-dependent change between hyperbolic and elliptic polariton propagation, revealing a polaritonic transition at THz frequencies. As a result, we are able to allocate canalization (highly collimated propagation) of confined THz radiation by carefully adjusting these two parameters, i.e. frequency and twist angle. Specifically, we report polariton canalization in {\\alpha}-MoO\\textsubscript{3} at 8.67\\,THz for a twist angle of 50{\\deg}. Our results demonstrate an unprecedented control and the manipulation of highly-confined collective excitations at THz frequencies, offering novel possibilities for nanophotonic applications. ",

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most promising technology for advancing current photovoltaic performance. However, the main challenge for their practical deployment and commercialization is their operational stability, affected by solar illumination and heating, as well as the electric field that is generated in the PV device by light exposure. Here, we propose a transparent multispectral photonic electrode placed on top of the glass substrate of solar cells, which simultaneously reduces the device solar heating and enhances its efficiency. Specifically, the proposed photonic electrode, composed of a low-resistivity metal and a conductive layer, simultaneously serves as a highly-efficient infrared filter and an ultra-thin transparent front contact, decreasing devices' solar heating and operating temperature. At the same time, it simultaneously serves as an anti-reflection coating, enhancing the efficiency. We additionally enhance the device cooling by coating the front glass substrate side with a visibly transparent film (PDMS), which maximizes substrate's thermal radiation. To determine the potential of our photonic approach and fully explore the cooling potential of PSCs, we first provide experimental characterizations of the absorption properties (in both visible and infrared wavelengths) of state-of-the-art PSCs among the most promising ones regarding the efficiency, stability, and cost. We then numerically show that applying our approach to promising PSCs can result in lower operating temperatures by over 9.0 oC and an absolute efficiency increase higher than 1.3%. These results are insensitive to varying environmental conditions. Our approach is simple and only requires modification of the substrate; it therefore points to a feasible photonic approach for advancing current photovoltaic performance with next-generation solar cell materials.

    "abstract": "The modification of thermal chemical rates in Fabry-Perot cavities, as observed in experiments, still poses theoretical challenges. While we have a better grasp of how the reactivity of isolated molecules and model systems changes under strong coupling, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the combined effects and the specific roles played by activated and spectator molecules during reactive events. In this study, we investigate an ensemble of randomly oriented gas-phase HONO molecules undergoing a cis-trans isomerization reaction on an ab-initio potential energy surface. Using the classical reactive flux method, we analyze the transmission coefficient and determine conditions that lead to accelerated rates within the collective regime. We identify two main mechanisms at work: firstly, spectator molecules enhance the cavity's ability to dissipate excess energy from the activated molecule post-reactive event. Additionally, the interaction between spectator molecules and the cavity gives rise to the creation of polaritonic modes. These modes then interact with the activated molecule at a shifted resonance frequency. ",

Dielectric structures have been used to address this issue, but they usually offer weak trap stiffness. In this work, we exploit the Fano resonance effect in an all-dielectric quadrupole nanostructure to realize a twenty-fold enhancement of trap stiffness, compared to the off-resonance case. This enables a high effective trap stiffness of $1.19$ fN/nm for 100 nm diameter polystyrene nanoparticles with 3.5 mW/$\\mu$m$^{2}$ illumination. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the structure to simultaneously trap two particles at distinct locations within the nanostructure array. ",

These resonant conditions have been studied in detail. Analytical formulas for the resonant differential cross-section of channels A and B of the reaction are obtained. It is shown that the resonant differential cross-section significantly depends on the value of the characteristic Breit-Wheeler energy, which is determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic wave and the initial gamma quanta. With a decrease in the characteristic Breit-Wheeler energy, the resonant cross-section increases sharply and may exceed the corresponding non-resonant cross-section by several orders of magnitude. ",

Such an actuator directly couples microwave signals to a high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator defined by the suspended silica cladding of the optical waveguide core, which leads to enhanced electromechanical and optomechanical couplings. At room temperature, this triply resonant piezo-optomechanical transducer achieves an off-chip photon number conversion efficiency of -48 dB over a bandwidth of 25 MHz at an input pump power of 21 dBm. The approach is scalable in manufacturing and, unlike existing electro-optic transducers, does not rely on superconducting resonators. As the transduction process is bidirectional, we further demonstrate synthesis of microwave pulses from a purely optical input. Combined with the capability of leveraging multiple acoustic modes for transduction, the present platform offers prospects for building frequency-multiplexed qubit interconnects and for microwave photonics at large.

The dynamics of an object moving in the force landscape of an acoustic trap can be significantly influenced by the inertia of the surrounding fluid medium. These inertial effects can be observed by setting a trapped object in oscillation and tracking it as it relaxes back to mechanical equilibrium in its trap. Large deviations from Stokesian dynamics during this process can be explained quantitatively by accounting for boundary-layer effects in the fluid.
