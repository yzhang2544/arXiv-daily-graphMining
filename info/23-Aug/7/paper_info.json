    "abstract": "Optical parametric oscillators enable the conversion of pump light to new frequency bands using nonlinear optical processes. Recent advances in integrated nonlinear photonics have led to create compact, chip-scale sources via Kerr nonlinearity-induced parametric oscillations. While these sources have provided broadband wavelength tuning, the ability to tune the emission wavelength via dynamically altering the dispersion, has not been attained so far. Here we present a voltage-tunable, on-chip integrated optical parametric oscillator based on alternating dispersiondimer, allowing to tune the emission over nearly 20 THz near 1550 nm. Unlike previous approaches, our device eliminates the need for a widely tunable pump laser source and provides efficient pump filtering at the drop port of the auxiliary ring. Integration of this scheme on a chip opens up the possibility of compact and low-cost voltage-tunable parametric oscillators with diverse application possibilities. ",

    "abstract": "We report experimental observations of the volume acoustic modes of air bubbles in water, including both the fundamental Minnaert breathing mode and a family of higher-order modes extending into the megahertz frequency range. Bubbles were placed on or near optomechanical sensors having a noise floor substantially determined by ambient medium fluctuations, and thus able to detect thermal Brownian motions of proximate objects. Bubble motions could be coupled to the sensor through both air (i.e., with the sensor inside the bubble) and water, verifying that sound is radiated by the high-order modes. In some cases, we also observed hybridization between the mechanical modes of the sensor and those of nearby bubbles. Finally, and more speculatively, we found evidence for Purcell-effect modification of the sensor vibrational spectrum when encapsulated by a bubble. ",

    "abstract": "We study the generation of attosecond XUV pulses via high-order frequency mixing (HFM) of two intense generating fields, and compare this process with the more common high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process. We calculate the macroscopic XUV signal by numerically integrating the 1D propagation equation coupled with the 3D time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We analytically find the length scales which limit the quadratic growth of the HFM macroscopic signal with propagation length. Compared to HHG these length scales are much longer for a group of HFM components, with orders defined by the frequencies of the generating fields. This results in a higher HFM macroscopic signal despite the microscopic response being lower than for HHG. In our numerical simulations, the intensity of the HFM signal is several times higher than that for HHG in a gas, and it is up to three orders of magnitude higher for generation in plasma; it is also higher for longer generating pulses. The HFM provides very narrow XUV lines ($\\delta \\omega / \\omega = 4.6 \\times 10^{-4}$) with well-defined frequencies, thus allowing for a simple extension of optical frequency standards to the XUV range. Finally, we show that the group of HFM components effectively generated due to macroscopic effects provides a train of attosecond pulses such that the carrier-envelope phase of an individual attosecond pulse can be easily controlled by tuning the phase of one of the generating fields.

    "abstract": "We present a quantum dynamic study on organic lasing phenomena, which is a challenging issue in organic optoelectronics. Previously, phenomenological method has achieved success in describing experimental observation. However, it cannot directly bridge the laser threshold with molecular electronic structure parameters and cavity parameters. Quantum dynamics method for describing organic lasing and obtaining laser threshold is highly expected. In this Letter, we first propose a microscopic model suitable for describing the lasing dynamics of organic molecular system and we apply the time-dependent wave-packet diffusion (TDWPD) to reveal the microscopic quantum dynamical process for the optical pumped lasing behavior. Lasing threshold is obtained from the onset of output as a function of optical input pumping. We predict that the lasing threshold has an optimal value as function of the cavity volume and depends linearly on the intracavity photon leakage rate. The structure-property relationships between molecular electronic structure parameters (including the energy of molecular excited state, the transition dipole and the organization energy) and the laser threshold obtained through numerical calculations are in qualitative agreement the experimental results, which also confirms the reliability of our approach. This work is beneficial to understanding the mechanism of organic laser and optimizing the design of organic laser materials. TOC ",

First, a macro model, based on a compact transistor based circuit, was implemented in LTSPICE. Then, a descriptive model was extracted and implemented in MATLAB, which is based on the macro model. This macro model was extended to develop a physical model that describes the processes that occur during the threshold switching. The physical model derived comprises a delay structure with few electrical components adjacent to the second junction. The delay model incorporates an internal state variable, which is crucial to transform the descriptive model into a compact model and to parameterize it in terms of electrical parameters that represent the component's behavior. Finally, we applied our model by fitting measured i-v data of an OTS device manufactured by Western Digital Research. ",

The magnon mode is simultaneously driven by two microwave fields at the blue and red sidebands associated with the vibration mode. The two-tone drive induces a squeezed magnonic reservoir for the intracavity field, leading to a squeezed cavity mode due to the cavity-magnon state swapping, which further yields a squeezed cavity output field. The squeezing of the output field is stationary and substantial using currently available parameters in cavity magnomechanics. The work indicates the potential of the cavity magnomechanical system in preparing squeezed microwave fields, and may find promising applications in quantum information science and quantum metrology.

To address this issue, we propose an experiment-based deep learning approach for metasurface inverse design and demonstrate its effectiveness for power allocation in complex environments with obstacles. Enabled by the tunability of a programmable metasurface, large sets of experimental data in various configurations can be collected for DNN training. The DNN trained by experimental data can inherently incorporate complex factors and can adapt to changed environments through its on-site data-collecting and fast-retraining capability. The proposed experiment-based DNN holds the potential for intelligent and energy-efficient wireless communication in complex indoor environments. ",
