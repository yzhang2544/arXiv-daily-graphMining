    "abstract": "The frequency band 1-15 GHz provides exciting prospects for resonant axion haloscopes as indicated by cosmological and astrophysical arguments. Among the challenges currently addressed to reach the required sensitivity, the development of high quality factor cavities that tolerate multi-Tesla fields plays a central role. We report a 3D resonator based on a right circular copper cavity with hollow cylinders that confine higher order modes around the cylinder axis. Its effective volume at 10.3\\,GHz is $3.4 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ liters, and under an 8\\,T-field we measured an internal quality factor of more than 9 millions. These parameters demonstrate the potential of this unique resonator to probe galactic dark matter axion at remarkable scan rates of 15\\,MHz/day when the cavity is readout by a quantum-limited receiver.

    "abstract": "Hypothetical short-range interactions could be detected by measuring the wavefunctions of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) on a mirror bounded by the Earth's gravitational field. The Searches require detectors with higher spatial resolution. We are developing a UCN detector for the with a high spatial resolution, which consists of a Si substrate, a thin converter layer including $^{10}$B$_{4}$C, and a layer of fine-grained nuclear emulsion. Its resolution was estimated to be less than 100 nm by fitting tracks of either $^{7}$Li nuclei or $\\alpha$-particles, which were created when neutrons interacted with the $^{10}$B$_{4}$C layer. For actual measurements of the spatial distributions, the following two improvements were made: The first was to establish a method to align microscopic images with high accuracy within a wide region of 65 mm $\\times$ 0.2 mm. We created reference marks of 1 $\\mu$m and 5 $\\mu$m diameter with an interval of 50 $\\mu$m and 500 $\\mu$m, respectively, on the Si substrate by electron beam lithography and realized a position accuracy of less than 30 nm. The second was to build a holder that could maintain the atmospheric pressure around the nuclear emulsion to utilize it under vacuum during exposure to UCNs. The intrinsic resolution of the improved detector was estimated by evaluating the blur of a transmission image of a gadolinium grating taken by cold neutrons as better than 0.56 $\\pm$ 0.08 $\\mu$m, which included the grating accuracy. A test exposure to UCNs was conducted to obtain the spatial distribution of UCNs in the Earth's gravitational field. Although the test was successful, a blurring of 6.9 $\\mu$m was found in the measurements, compared with a theoretical curve. We identified the blurring caused by the refraction of UCNs due to the roughness of the upstream surface of the substrate. Polishing of the surface makes the resolution less than 100 nm. ",

We investigate the laser threshold under optical pumping and assess quantitatively the effect of a varying optically-pumped length. The laser effect is achieved for an exciton reservoir length of just 15% of the cavity length, which would not be possible in a conventional ridge laser, with an inversion-less polaritonic gain about 10 times larger than in equivalent GaN lasers. The modelling of the cavity free spectral range demonstrates the polaritonic nature of the modes. ",

With advances in piezoelectric crystal technology, high-frequency ultrasound imaging has developed to achieve comparatively high resolution without the drawbacks of ionising radiation. This research proposes a low-cost, non-invasive and real-time protocol for informing photo-therapy procedures using ultrasound imaging. We combine currently available ultrasound procedures with Monte Carlo methods for assessing light transport and photo-energy deposition in the tissue. The measurements from high-resolution ultrasound scans is used as input for optical simulations. Consequently, this provides a pipeline that will inform medical practitioners for better therapy strategy planning. While validating known inferences of light transport through biological tissue, our results highlight the range of information such as temporal monitoring and energy deposition at varying depths. This process also retains the flexibility of testing various wavelengths for individual-specific geometries and anatomy. ",

We report periodic stability enhancements linked with phase variations and highlight that both phase variation and phase offsets play an important role.

    "abstract": "Retroreflectors that can accurately redirect the incident wave in free space back along its original channel provide unprecedented opportunities for light manipulation in wireless communication. However, to the best of our knowledge, the existing methods of designing retroreflectors suffer from either the bulky size, narrow angular bandwidth, or time-consuming post-processing. Here, a scheme of designing ultrathin and all-angle retroreflectors based on hyperbolic plasmonic metasurfaces is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The physical mechanism underlying this scheme is the high-efficiency all-angle transition between the traveling waves in free space and the canalized spoof surface plasmon (SSP) on the hyperbolic plasmonic metasurfaces (HPMs). In this case, the strong confinement characteristic benefited from the enhanced light-matter interaction enables us to route and retroreflect the canalized SSP with extremely ultrathin structures. As proof of the scheme, a retroreflector prototype with a thickness approximately equal to the central wavelength is designed and fabricated. Further experimental investigation obtains a maximum efficiency of 83.2% and a half-power field of view up to 53{\\deg}. This scheme can find promising applications in target detection, remote sensing, and diverse on-chip light control devices. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum sensing with solid-state systems finds broad applications in diverse areas ranging from material and biomedical sciences to fundamental physics. Several solid-state spin sensors have been developed, facilitating the ultra-sensitive detection of physical quantities such as magnetic and electric fields and temperature. Exploiting collective behaviour of non-interacting spins holds the promise of pushing the detection limit to even lower levels, while to date, those levels are scarcely reached due to the broadened linewidth and inefficient readout of solid-state spin ensembles. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such drawbacks can be overcome by newly reborn maser technology at room temperature in the solid state. Owing to maser action, we observe a 4-fold reduction in the inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of a molecular spin ensemble, which is narrower than the same measured from single spins at cryogenic temperatures. The maser-based readout applied to magnetometry showcases a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB for single shots. This technique would be a significant addition to the toolbox for boosting the sensitivity of solid-state ensemble spin sensors. ",

In the present work, for the case of two-dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation, the efficiency of the iterative algorithm in reconstruction of middle strength scatterers and advantages of the functional-analytical approach in recovering strong scatterers are demonstrated. A filtering procedure is considered in the space of wave vectors, which additionally increases the convergence of the iterative algorithm. Reconstruction results of sound speed perturbations demonstrate the comparable noise immunity and resolution of the considered algorithms when reconstructing middle strength scatterers. A comparative numerical investigation of the iterative and functional-analytical algorithms in inverse acoustic scattering problems is implemented in this work for the first time. ",

However, the realization of high-flux sources of Bose-Einstein condensates remains challenging due to the necessity of optical trapping to use a Feshbach resonance. We investigate the production of all-optical $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates under different scattering lengths using a low-field Feshbach resonance near $33$ G. By tuning the scattering length in a range between $75$ a$_0$ and $300$ a$_0$ we demonstrate a trade off between evaporation speed and final atom number and decrease our evaporation time by a factor of $5$ while approximately doubling the atomic flux. To this end, we are able to produce fully condensed ensembles with $5\\times 10^4$ atoms within $850$ ms evaporation time at a scattering length of $232$ a$_0$ and $1.6\\times 10^5$ atoms within $4$ s at $158$ a$_0$, respectively. We analyze the flux scaling with respect to collision rates and describe routes towards high-flux sources of ultra-cold potassium for inertial sensing. ",
