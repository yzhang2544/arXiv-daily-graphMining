    "abstract": "Metallic nanocavity lasers provide important technological advancement towards even smaller integrable light sources. They give access to widely unexplored lasing physics in which the distinction between different operational regimes, like those of thermal or a coherent light emission, becomes increasingly challenging upon approaching a device with a near-perfect spontaneous-emission coupling factor $\\beta$. In fact, quantum-optical studies have to be employed to reveal a transition to coherent emission in the intensity fluctuation behavior of nanolasers when the input-output characteristic appears thresholdless for $\\beta = 1$ nanolasers. Here, we identify a new indicator for lasing operation in high-$\\beta$ lasers by showing that stimulated emission can give rise to a lineshape anomaly manifesting as a transition from a Lorentzian to a Gaussian component in the emission linewidth that dominates the spectrum above the lasing threshold.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal properties of electron bunches are critical for the performance of a wide range of scientific facilities. In a free-electron laser, for example, the existing diagnostics only provide very limited longitudinal information of the electron bunch during online tuning and optimization. We leverage the power of artificial intelligence to build a neural network model using experimental data, in order to bring the destructive longitudinal phase space (LPS) diagnostics online virtually and improve the existing current profile online diagnostics which uses a coherent transition radiation (CTR) spectrometer. The model can also serve as a digital twin of the real machine on which algorithms can be tested efficiently and effectively. We demonstrate at the FLASH facility that the encoder-decoder model with more than one decoder can make highly accurate predictions of megapixel LPS images and coherent transition radiation spectra concurrently for electron bunches in a bunch train with broad ranges of LPS shapes and peak currents, which are obtained by scanning all the major control knobs for LPS manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a way to significantly improve the CTR spectrometer online measurement by combining the predicted and measured spectra. Our work showcases how to combine virtual and real diagnostics in order to provide heterogeneous and reliable mixed diagnostics for scientific facilities. ",

An optical lattice clock based on partially delocalized Wannier-Stark states in a gravity-tilted shallow lattice supports superior quantum coherence and adjustable interactions via spin-orbit coupling, thus presenting a powerful spin model realization. The relative strength of the on-site and off-site interactions can be tuned to achieve a zero density shift at a `magic' lattice depth. This mechanism, together with a large number of atoms, enables the demonstration of the most stable atomic clock while minimizing a key systematic uncertainty related to atomic density.

    "abstract": "The generation of rapidly tunable Optical Vortex (OV) beams is one of the most demanding research areas of the present era as they possess Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) with additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to enhance signal-carrying capacity by using mode division multiplexing and information encoding in optical communication. Particularly, rapidly tunable OAM devices at a fixed wavelength in the telecom band stir extensive interest among researchers for both classical and quantum applications. This article demonstrates the realistic design of a Si-integrated photonic device for rapidly tunable OAM wave generation at a 1550-nm wavelength by using an ultra-low-loss Phase Change Material (PCM) embedded with a Si-ring resonator with angular gratings. Different OAM modes are achieved by tuning the effective refractive index using rapid electrical switching of Sb2Se3 film from amorphous to crystalline states and vice versa. The generation of OAM waves relies on a traveling wave modulation of the refractive index of the micro-ring, which breaks the degeneracy of oppositely oriented whispering gallery modes. The proposed device is capable of producing rapidly tunable OV beams, carrying different OAM modes by using electrically controllable switching of ultra-low-loss PCM Sb2Se3. ",

Here, we report on the spectra observed during a strongly driven, single-frequency, two-photon excitation of cold rubidium atoms near an optical nanofibre. At resonance, two competitive processes, namely a higher excitation rate and stronger pushing of atoms from the nanofibre due to resonance scattering, need to be considered. We discuss the processes that lead to the observed two-peak profile in the fluorescence spectrum as the excitation laser is scanned across the resonance, noting that the presence of the optical nanofibre dramatically changes the fluorescence signal. These observations are useful for experiments where high electric field intensities near an ONF are needed, for example when driving nonlinear processes. ",

    "abstract": "Optical spectrometers are widely used scientific equipment with many applications involving material characterization, chemical analysis, disease diagnostics, surveillance, etc. Emerging applications in biomedical and communication fields have boosted the research in the miniaturization of spectrometers. Recently, reconstruction-based spectrometers have gained popularity for their compact size, easy maneuverability, and versatile utilities. These devices exploit the superior computational capabilities of recent computers to reconstruct hyperspectral images using detectors with distinct responsivity to different wavelengths. In this paper, we propose a CMOS compatible reconstruction-based on-chip spectrometer pixels capable of spectrally resolving the visible spectrum with 1 nm spectral resolution maintaining high accuracy (>95 %) and low footprint (8 um x 8 um), all without the use of any additional filters. A single spectrometer pixel is formed by an array of silicon photodiodes, each having a distinct absorption spectrum due to their integrated nanostructures, this allows us to computationally reconstruct the hyperspectral image. To achieve distinct responsivity, we utilize random photon-trapping nanostructures per photodiode with different dimensions and shapes that modify the coupling of light at different wavelengths. This also reduces the spectrometer pixel footprint (comparable to conventional camera pixels), thus improving spatial resolution. Moreover, deep trench isolation (DTI) reduces the crosstalk between adjacent photodiodes. This miniaturized spectrometer can be utilized for real-time in-situ biomedical applications such as Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), pulse oximetry, disease diagnostics, and surgical guidance.

Therefore, in this work, tunneling ionization in the adiabatic limit is considered for an effective field that includes effects beyond the electric-dipole term to first order in $1/c$, with $c$ the speed of light. The nondipole term describes the interaction resulting from the electric dipole-induced velocity of the electron and the magnetic field component of the laser. The impact of this term on the ionization rate, tunnel exit point, momentum at the tunnel exit and electron dynamics is discussed. In the appropriate limit, the results of a nondipole strong-field approximation approach and those of the strict adiabatic limit, where time and field strength are parameters, are consistent. The nondipole strong-field approximation approach is used to identify nonadiabatic modifications of the initial conditions. The results open up an avenue to include nondipole effects in the initial tunneling ionization step in semiclassical models of strong-field and attosecond physics. ",

To mitigate the structure-borne vibrations from subways, this study proposes an LRPF equipped with a negative stiffness device connecting the resonator and primary structure. The proposed LRPF can exhibit a quasi-static band gap covering the ultra-low frequency range. These frequency components have the properties of strong diffraction and low attenuation and contribute the most to the incident wave fields impinging on nearby buildings. By formulating the interaction problem between the tunnel-ground and LRPF-superstructure systems, the mitigation performance of the proposed LRPF is evaluated considering the effects of soil compliance and superstructure. The performance depends on the dynamic properties of the ground, foundation, and superstructure as well as their coupling. Transmission analyses indicate that the superstructure responses can be effectively attenuated in the quasi-static band gap by adjusting the negative stiffness. Considering the coupling of the flexible ground, the peak responses of the LRPF-superstructure system occur not only at its eigenfrequencies but also at coupled resonance frequencies due to the contribution of the soil compliance. This study provides an analytical tool for mitigating the structure-borne vibrations from subways with the LRPF. ",

Excitation of dispersive waves is a particularly interesting process that allows efficient nonlinear wavelength conversion by phase-matching of a soliton and waves in the normal dispersion regime. However, controlling the wavelength of dispersive waves in integrated waveguides remains an open challenge, hampering versatile shaping of the nonlinear spectral response. Here, we show that metamaterial silicon waveguides release new degrees of freedom to select the wavelength of dispersive waves. Based on this concept, we experimentally demonstrate excitation of two dispersive waves near 1.55 {\\mu}m and 7.5 {\\mu}m allowing ultra-wideband supercontinuum generation, covering most of the silicon transparency window.

We then develop a numerical simulation to explain the observed dynamic range of trapping by estimating the temperature distribution across a particle surface, and determining the photophoretic force. Our simulation results are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

    "title": "Precision laser diagnostics for LUXE",
    "abstract": "Strong field QED is an active research frontier. The investigation of fundamental phenomena such as pair creation, photon-photon and photon-electron interactions in the nonlinear QED regime are a formidable challenge -- both experimentally and theoretically. Several experiments around the world are being planned or in preparation to probe this strong field regime. LUXE (Laser Und XFEL Experiment) is an experimental platform which envisages the collision of the high quality 16.5 GeV electron beam from the European XFEL accelerator with a 100 TW class high power laser. One of the unique features of LUXE is to measure the key observables such as pair rates ($e^+e^-$) with unprecedented accuracy in the characterization of both beams together with ample statistics. The state-of-art detector technologies for high energy particle and photon detection enable percent level precision. The state-of-art high power lasers offer high quality laser beams, however, the residual shot-to-shot fluctuations coupled with the large nonlinearity of the processes under investigation form a particular challenge. An uncertainty of 5 percent on the absolute laser intensity already leads to a very large ( about 40 percent) uncertainty in the pair rate. Hence it becomes essential to control the laser parameters precisely. To mitigate this issue a full suite of laser diagnostics is being currently developed at the JETI40 laser in Jena with the aim of tagging the shot intensity to less than 1 percent. In this presentation, details of the laser and the diagnostics suit for the single shot tagging of all the laser parameters will be presented. Moreover, results from an ongoing campaign to properly relay image the beam without significant distortion of the laser beam parameters for post-diagnosis will be discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Helicity preserving nanostructures and metasurfaces have been recently proposed as suitable candidates to enhance spectroscopic features of chiral matter. With this in mind, we highlight that losses in the constituent nonmagnetic materials dramatically affect the possibility of constructing structures which conserve helicity. We first present a general procedure that permits the evaluation of the normalized helicity expectation value, $\\langle\\hat{\\Lambda}\\rangle$, i.e. the observable that permits the identification of helicity preserving scatterers. We then apply this procedure to the case of a chiral sphere, which in an orientation averaged picture can capture the optical response of chiral inorganic nanostructures, obtaining a widely applicable analytical expression of $\\langle\\hat{\\Lambda}\\rangle$ for this type of objects. Finally, we numerically show that optical losses impose an upper bound to the helicity expectation value on nonmagnetic core-shells and chiral spheres. ",

This non-resonant method is analogous to conventional Raman scattering, except that the observed spectral features relate to the oscillatory center-of-mass motion of each species within the lattice, determined uniquely by their respective polarizability-to-mass ratio. Depending on the density of the probed sample, detection occurs either via optical scattering at the high end or via non-resonant ionization at the lower end. We show that such a technique is complementary to conventional mass spectrometry techniques and envision its implementation in existing instruments. ",

In the hybrid media, a blueshift of the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs as a function of increasing Al-doping of the substrate was observed, ascribed to the occurrence of a charge transfer between the two materials and the doping-dependent variation of the polarizability of the substrate.

Among the available spectroscopic approaches, GHz MIR dual-comb absorption spectrometers have the potential to simultaneously combine the high-speed, high spectral resolution, and broad optical bandwidth needed to accurately study complex, transient events in chemistry, combustion, and microscopy. However, such a spectrometer has not yet been demonstrated due to the lack of GHz MIR frequency combs with broad and full spectral coverage. Here, we introduce the first broadband MIR frequency comb laser platform at 1 GHz repetition rate that achieves spectral coverage from 3 to 13 {\\mu}m. This frequency comb is based on a commercially available 1.56 {\\mu}m mode-locked laser, robust all-fiber Er amplifiers and intra-pulse difference frequency generation (IP-DFG) of few-cycle pulses in \\c{hi}(2) nonlinear crystals. When used in a dual comb spectroscopy (DCS) configuration, this source will simultaneously enable measurements with {\\mu}s time resolution, 1 GHz (0.03 cm-1) spectral point spacing and a full bandwidth of >5 THz (>166 cm-1) anywhere within the MIR atmospheric windows. This represents a unique spectroscopic resource for characterizing fast and non-repetitive events that are currently inaccessible with other sources. ",

    "abstract": "We studied a qubit based on flux-pinning effects in $\\Delta$H=$\\Delta$B region of a superconductor. When volume defects are many enough in a superconductor, $\\Delta$H=$\\Delta$B region on M-H curve is formed, which is the region that increased applied magnetic field ($\\Delta$H) is the same as increasing magnetic induction ($\\Delta$B). Magnetization (M) is constant in the region by 4$\\pi$M = B - H. Here we show that the behavior of fluxes in $\\Delta$H=$\\Delta$B region can be a candidate of qubit. Pinned fluxes on volume defects would move as a bundle in the region by repeating flux-pinning and pick-out depinning process from the surface to the center of the superconductor. During the process, magnetic fluxes would exist as one of states that are flux-pinning state at volume defects and pick-out depinning state in which fluxes are moving in the superconductor. A difference of diamagnetic property occurs between pinning state at volume defects and depinning state from the volume defects. Thus, diamagnetic properties of the superconductor would oscillate in $\\Delta$H=$\\Delta$B region and the behavior would be observed in M-H curve. The oscillation can be used for qubit by setting the pinning state at volume defects as $\\ket{1}$ and the depinned state as $\\ket{0}$. This method can operate at higher temperatures than that of using Josephson Junctions. In addition, it is expected that the device is quite simple and decoherences can be almost negligible. ",

The well-known branch-counting rule, for realistic models of measurements, in which branches are defined by decoherence theory, fails this test. The new rule hinges on the use of decoherence theory in defining branching structure, and specifically decoherent histories theory. On this basis ratios of branch numbers are defined, free of any convention. They agree with the Born rule, and deliver a notion of objective probability similar to na\\\"ive frequentism, save that the frequencies of outcomes are not confined to a single world at different times, but spread over worlds at a single time. Nor is it ad hoc: it is recognizably akin to the combinatorial approach to thermodynamic probability, as introduced by Boltzmann in 1879. It is identical to the procedure followed by Planck, Bose, Einstein and Dirac in defining the equilibrium distribution of the Bose-Einstein gas. It also connects in a simple way with the decision-theory approach to quantum probability. ",

In comparison, the topological properties of nodal lines, which are one-dimensional degeneracies in momentum space, remain less explored. Here, we explain the theoretical concept of topological nodal lines and review recent and ongoing progress using artificial materials. The review includes recent demonstrations of non-Abelian topological charges of nodal lines in momentum space and examples of nodal lines realized in photonic and other systems.

Common techniques mostly rely on time-of-flight measurements and do not exploit the spectral content: however, sound speed and attenuation spectra contain rich information. Such an acoustic spectroscopy already exists and allows to retrieve subtle information on systems of well-known physico-chemistry, but modeling becomes out of reach for industrial systems. In this article, we use a simple empirical approach to monitor the gelation of silica suspensions: we show that the gelation time obtained from acoustic measurements is proportional to this determined with more conventional rheological characterization. Such a results thus opens the way for in-situ monitoring of time-evolving systems in industrial context with acoustic methods only. ",

The quantum memory under consideration comprises of an optomechanical system with additional Kerr non-linearity in the optical mode and an anharmonic mechanical oscillator with quadratic non-linearity. Time degradation is monitored, both in terms of loss of coherence which is analyzed with the help of Wigner functions, as well as in terms of loss of amplitude of the original state studied as a function of time. While our time trajectories explore the degree to which the stored information degrades depending upon the variation in values of various parameters involved, we suggest a set of parameters for which the original information can be retrieved without degradation. We come across a highly attention seeking situation where the role played by the non-linearity is insignificant and the system behaves as if the information is stored in a linear medium. For this case, the information retrieval is independent of the coherence revival time and can be retrieved at any instant during the time evolution. ",

Nowadays, experiments with ultracold quantum gases allow researchers to routinely access temperature scales well below a nanokelvin.

Carrying out experiments in space, where quantum matter can freely float for unrivalled extended times, is therefore an active research quest in physics. The space environment allows in addition to manipulate quantum gases or mixtures of them by undistorted symmetric traps generated in compact science chambers. Here we report on a series of experiments employing NASA's Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station, where we have created and manipulated Bose-Einstein condensates that expand with energies of a few tens of picokelvin. Our methods promote the Cold Atom Lab multi-user facility into a high-precision, on-orbit laboratory accelerating numerous research applications such as the study of quantum bubbles, space atom lasers, few-body physics, quantum reflection from material surfaces or entangled state preparation. Moreover, this exquisite control will be crucial for space-based quantum information processing and quantum simulation and will boost applications such as Earth observation, relativistic geodesy and tests of fundamental physical laws.

This exemplifies a quantum thermal machine, which uses a quantum system as a working medium to transfer heat between reservoirs. We review the derivation of the Bloch-Redfield equation for a quantum system coupled to a reservoir, and its extension, using counting fields, to calculate heat currents. We use the full form of this equation, which makes only the weak-coupling and Markovian approximations, to calculate the cooling power for a simple model of laser cooling. We compare its predictions with two other time-local master equations: the secular approximation to the full Bloch-Redfield equation, and the Lindblad form expected for phonon transitions in the absence of driving. We conclude that the full Bloch-Redfield equation provides accurate results for the heat current in both the weak- and strong- driving regimes, whereas the other forms have more limited applicability. Our results support the use of Bloch-Redfield equations in quantum thermal machines, in spite of their potential to give unphysical results. ",
