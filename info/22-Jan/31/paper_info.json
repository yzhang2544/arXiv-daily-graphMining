Via detailed analysis on several dominating noise sources, we have proposed solutions that significantly lower the MOKE noise, and a sensitivity of $1.5\\times10^{-7} \\text{rad}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ is achieved with long-term stability. The sensitivity of the apparatus is tested by measuring a wedge-shaped Ni thin film on $\\text{SiO}_2$ with Ni thickness varying from 0 to 3 nm.

    "title": "Beam pointing stabilization of an acousto-optic modulator with thermal  control",
    "abstract": "Diffraction beams generated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) are widely used in various optical experiments, some of which require high angular stability with the temporal modulation of optical power. Usually, it is difficult to realize both angular stability and high-power modulation in a passive setup without a servo system of radio-frequency compensation. Here, we present a method to suppress the angular drift and pointing noise only with the thermal management of the AOM crystal. We analyze the dependence of the angular drift on the refractive index variation, and find that the angular drift is very sensitivity to the temperature gradient which could induce the refractive index gradient inside the AOM crystal. It reminds us such angular drift could be significantly suppressed by carefully overlapping the zero temperature gradient area with the position of the acousto-optic interaction zone. We implement a water-cooling setup, and find that the angular drift of an AOM is reduced over 100 times during the thermal transient, and the angular noise is also suppressed to 1/3 of the non-cooled case. It should be emphasized that this thermal control method is a general to suppress the beam drift in both the diffraction and the perpendicular-to-diffraction directions. The refractive index thermal coefficient of tellurium dioxide crystal at 1064 nm determined by this angular drift-temperature model is 16$\\times$10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ consistent with previous studies. This thermal control technique provides potential applications for optical trapping and remote sensoring that demand for intensity ramps. ",

    "abstract": "Herein we demonstrate that the performance of mesoporous silica SBA-15 and SBA-15-Ag impregnated during plasma ammonia synthesis depend on the plasma conditions. At high power the mesoporous silica SBA-15 without Ag produces the largest amount of ammonia observed in our experiments, but the addition of Ag provides a minor benefit at lower powers. Plasma conditions were analyzed using optical emission spectroscopy using N2, N2+ and NH molecular bands and H{\\alpha} lines. The analysis of optical emission, specifically Ha lines and N2 molecular bands data shows that SBA-15 has higher electron density, and higher N2 vibrational temperature. Stronger N2+ emission relative to the neutral N2 provides additional evidence for higher electron density in the SBA-15 packed bed reactors. The addition of Ag resulted in a lower concentration of atomic hydrogen. Where Ag acts as a hydrogen sink facilitating surface reactions with nitrogen. The presence NH in the spectrum may indicate a higher concentration of H in the SBA-15 reactor. From the materials point of view SBA-15 is a more robust catalyst with a commendable surface area retention after plasma exposure due to the lack of local heating generated when a metal is in the structure.

The neutrons are produced by bombarding a low energy proton beam on a beryllium or lithium target. In such an accelerator-based neutron source, the Radiofrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) is usually used to accelerate a high intensity proton beam to a few MeV. This paper mainly covers the high frequency structure design optimizations of a 4-vane RFQ with Pi-mode Stabilizer Loops (PISLs) and its RF stability analysis. A 176 MHz RFQ accelerator is designed to operate at 10% duty factor and could accelerate an 80-mA proton beam from 65 keV to 2.5 MeV within a length of 5.3 meters. The adoption of PISLs ensures large RF stability and makes the operation of the accelerator easier and implies less stringent alignment and machining tolerances. ",

Here, we study the emission of light from a radiation source inside a PTC. We solve the general classical and quantum mechanical models of emission in a temporally-varying medium, and find that radiation is always exponentially amplified when associated with the momentum gap, whether initiated by a macroscopic source, an atom, or by vacuum fluctuations, drawing the amplification energy from the modulation. The radiation linewidth becomes narrower as time advances, and is centered in the middle of the momentum gap. We calculate the spontaneous decay rate of an atom embedded in a PTC and show that it vanishes at the band edge due to low density of photonic states. Finally, we propose the concept of nonresonant tunable PTC lasers. ",

    "abstract": "Traveling-wave optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a promising technique to measure the stiffness of biological tissues. While OCE has been applied to relatively homogeneous samples, tissues with significantly varying elasticity through depth pose a challenge, requiring depth-resolved measurement with sufficient resolution and accuracy. Here, we develop a broadband Rayleigh-wave OCE technique capable of measuring the elastic moduli of the 3 major skin layers (epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis) reliably by analyzing the dispersion of leaky Rayleigh surface waves over a wide frequency range of 0.1-10 kHz. We show that a previously unexplored, high frequency range of 4-10 kHz is critical to resolve the thin epidermis, while a low frequency range of 0.2-1 kHz is adequate to probe the dermis and deeper hypodermis. We develop a dual bilayer-based inverse model to determine the elastic moduli in all 3 layers and verify its high accuracy with finite element analysis and skin-mimicking phantoms. Finally, the technique is applied to measure the forearm skin of healthy volunteers. The Young's modulus of the epidermis (including the stratum corneum) is measured to be ~ 4 MPa at 4-10 kHz, whereas Young's moduli of the dermis and hypodermis are about 40 and 15 kPa, respectively, at 0.2-1 kHz. Besides dermatologic applications, this method may be useful for the mechanical analysis of various other layered tissues with sub-mm depth resolution. ",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous structural rearrangements play a central role in the organization and function of complex biomolecular systems. In principle, physics-based computer simulations like Molecular Dynamics (MD) enable us to investigate these thermally activated processes with an atomic level of resolution. However, rare conformational transitions are intrinsically hard to investigate with MD, because an exponentially large fraction of computational resources must be invested to simulate thermal fluctuations in metastable states. Path sampling methods like Transition Path Sampling hold the great promise of focusing the available computational power on sampling the rare stochastic transition between metastable states. In these approaches, one of the outstanding limitations is to generate paths that visit significantly different regions of the conformational space at a low computational cost. To overcome these problems we introduce a rigorous approach that integrates a machine learning algorithm and MD simulations implemented on a classical computer with adiabatic quantum computing. First, using functional integral methods, we derive a rigorous low-resolution representation of the system's dynamics, based on a small set of molecular configurations generated with machine learning. Then, a quantum annealing machine is employed to explore the transition path ensemble of this low-resolution theory, without introducing un-physical biasing forces to steer the system's dynamics. Using the D-Wave quantum computer, we validate our scheme by simulating a benchmark conformational transition in a state-of-the-art atomistic description. We show that the quantum computing step generates uncorrelated trajectories, thus facilitating the sampling of the transition region in configuration space. Our results provide a new paradigm for MD simulations to integrate machine learning and quantum computing. ",

    "abstract": "Face recognition has recently become ubiquitous in many scenes for authentication or security purposes. Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns about the privacy of face images, which are sensitive biometric data that should be carefully protected. Software-based cryptosystems are widely adopted nowadays to encrypt face images, but the security level is limited by insufficient digital secret key length or computing power. Hardware-based optical cryptosystems can generate enormously longer secret keys and enable encryption at light speed, but most reported optical methods, such as double random phase encryption, are less compatible with other systems due to system complexity. In this study, a plain yet high-efficient speckle-based optical cryptosystem is proposed and implemented. A scattering ground glass is exploited to generate physical secret keys of gigabit length and encrypt face images via seemingly random optical speckles at light speed. Face images can then be decrypted from the random speckles by a well-trained decryption neural network, such that face recognition can be realized with up to 98% accuracy. The proposed cryptosystem has wide applicability, and it may open a new avenue for high-security complex information encryption and decryption by utilizing optical speckles. ",

For example, as the main branch of microwave photonics, radio-over-fiber technology provides high bandwidth, low-loss, and long-distance propagation capability, facilitating wide applications ranging from telecommunication to wireless networks. With ultrashort pulses as the optical carrier, huge capacity is further endowed. However, the wide bandwidth of ultrashort pulses results in the severe vulnerability of high-frequency RF signals to fiber dispersion. With a time-energy entangled biphoton source as the optical carrier and combined with the single-photon detection technique, a quantum microwave photonics method is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The results show that it not only realizes unprecedented nonlocal RF signal modulation with strong resistance to the dispersion associated with ultrashort pulse carriers but provides an alternative mechanism to effectively distill the RF signal out from the dispersion. Furthermore, the spurious-free dynamic range of both the nonlocally modulated and distilled RF signals has been significantly improved. With the ultra-weak detection and high-speed processing advantages endowed by the low-timing-jitter single-photon detection, the quantum microwave photonics method opens up new possibilities in modern communication and networks.

    "abstract": "The conventional approach to data-driven inversion framework is based on Gaussian statistics that presents serious difficulties, especially in the presence of outliers in the measurements. In this work, we present maximum likelihood estimators associated with generalized Gaussian distributions in the context of R\\'enyi, Tsallis and Kaniadakis statistics. In this regard, we analytically analyse the outlier-resistance of each proposal through the so-called influence function. In this way, we formulate inverse problems by constructing objective functions linked to the maximum likelihood estimators. To demonstrate the robustness of the generalized methodologies, we consider an important geophysical inverse problem with high noisy data with spikes. The results reveal that the best data inversion performance occurs when the entropic index from each generalized statistic is associated with objective functions proportional to the inverse of the error amplitude. We argue that in such a limit the three approaches are resistant to outliers and are also equivalent, which suggests a lower computational cost for the inversion process due to the reduction of numerical simulations to be performed and the fast convergence of the optimization process.
