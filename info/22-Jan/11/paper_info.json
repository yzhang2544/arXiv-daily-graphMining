    "title": "The influence of laser characteristics on internal flow behaviour in  laser melting of metallic substrates",
    "abstract": "The absorptivity of a material is a major uncertainty in numerical simulations of laser welding and additive manufacturing, and its value is often calibrated through trial-and-error exercises. This adversely affects the capability of numerical simulations when predicting the process behaviour and can eventually hinder the exploitation of fully digitised manufacturing processes, which is a goal of \"industry 4.0\". In the present work, an enhanced absorption model that takes into account the effects of laser characteristics, incident angle, surface temperature, and material composition is utilised to predict internal heat and fluid flow in laser melting of stainless steel 316L. Employing such an absorption model is physically more realistic than assuming a constant absorptivity and can reduce the costs associated with calibrating an appropriate value. High-fidelity three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed using both variable and constant absorptivity models and the predictions compared with experimental data. The results of the present work unravel the crucial effect of absorptivity on the physics of internal flow in laser material processing. The difference between melt-pool shapes obtained using fibre and CO$_2$ laser sources is explained, and factors affecting the local energy absorption are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "The ray dynamics of optical cavities exhibits bifurcation points: special geometries at which ray trajectories switch abruptly between stable and unstable. A prominent example is the Fabry-Perot cavity with two planar mirrors, which is widely employed for broad-area semiconductor lasers. Such cavities support lasing in a relatively small number of transverse modes, and the laser is highly susceptible to filamentation and irregular pulsations. Here we demonstrate experimentally that a slight deviation from this bifurcation point (planar cavity) dramatically changes the laser performance. In a near-planar cavity with two concave mirrors, the number of transverse lasing modes increases drastically. While the spatial coherence of the laser emission is reduced, the output directionality remains relatively high. Moreover, the spatio-temporal lasing dynamics becomes significantly more stable compared to that in a Fabry-Perot cavity. Our near-planar broad-area semiconductor lasers, which produce a stable output beam with low spatial coherence and high directionality, will find applications in full-field speckle-free imaging, material processing and optical pumping. Furthermore, our method of controlling spatio-temporal dynamics with extreme sensitivity near a bifurcation point may be applied to other types of high-power lasers and nonlinear dynamic systems. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms have opened a breach in the fortress of the prediction of high-dimensional chaotic systems. Their ability to find hidden correlations in data can be exploited to perform model-free forecasting of spatiotemporal chaos and extreme events. However, the extensive feature of these evolutions constitutes a critical limitation for full-size forecasting processes. Hence, the main challenge for forecasting relevant events is to establish the set of pertinent information. Here, we identify precursors from the transfer entropy of the system and a deep Long Short-Term Memory network to forecast the complex dynamics of a system evolving in a high-dimensional spatiotemporal chaotic regime. Performances of this triggerable model-free prediction protocol based on the information flowing map are tested from experimental data originating from a passive resonator operating in such a complex nonlinear regime. We have been able to predict the occurrence of extreme events up to 9 round trips after the detection of precursor, i.e., 3 times the horizon provided by Lyapunov exponents, with 92 % of true positive predictions leading to 60 % of accuracy.

In theory, we derived the expression of the quadratic Zeeman shift of 3P0 clock state for 88Sr and 87Sr in the weak-magnetic-field approximation. By using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory, the quadratic Zeeman shift coefficients were calculated.

The measurement was carried out in \"hybrid\" vapor cells containing both Rb and Cs metal in a prescribed ratio, producing approximately the same vapor density for both. Alternating measurements of the optically detected EPR frequency shifts caused by the SEOP polarization and subsequent sudden destruction of the same quantity of $^{129}$Xe magnetization were made for $^{133}$Cs and either $^{87}$Rb or $^{85}$Rb. An important source of systematic error caused by power fluctuations in the pump laser that produced variable light shifts in the EPR frequency was characterized and then mitigated by allowing sufficient warm-up time for the pump laser.

    "abstract": "We review one of the most versatile theoretical approaches to the study of time-dependent correlated quantum transport in nano-systems: the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Within this formalism, one can treat, on the same footing, inter-particle interactions, external drives and/or perturbations, and coupling to baths with a (piece-wise) continuum set of degrees of freedom. After a historical overview on the theory of transport in quantum systems, we present a modern introduction of the NEGF approach to quantum transport. We discuss the inclusion of inter-particle interactions using diagrammatic techniques, and the use of the so-called embedding and inbedding techniques which take the bath couplings into account non-perturbatively. In various limits, such as the non-interacting limit and the steady-state limit, we then show how the NEGF formalism elegantly reduces to well-known formulae in quantum transport as special cases. We then discuss non-equilibrium transport in general, for both particle and energy currents. Under the presence of a time-dependent drive - encompassing pump-probe scenarios as well as driven quantum systems - we discuss the transient as well as asymptotic behavior, and also how to use NEGF to infer information on the out-of-equilibrium system. As illustrative examples, we consider model systems general enough to pave the way to realistic systems. These examples encompass one- and two-dimensional electronic systems, systems with electron-phonon couplings, topological superconductors, and optically responsive molecular junctions where electron-photon couplings are relevant.

    "abstract": "We describe how a coherent optical drive that is near-resonant with the upper rungs of a three-level ladder system, in conjunction with a short pulse excitation, can be used to provide a frequency-tunable source of on-demand single photons. Using an intuitive master equation model, we identify two distinct regimes of device operation: (i) for a resonant drive, the source operates using the Autler-Townes effect, and (ii) for an off-resonant drive, the source exploits the ac Stark effect. The former regime allows for a large frequency tuning range but coherence suffers from timing jitter effects, while the latter allows for high indistinguishability and efficiency, but with a restricted tuning bandwidth due to high required drive strengths and detunings. We show how both these negative effects can be mitigated by using an optical cavity to increase the collection rate of the desired photons. We apply our general theory to semiconductor quantum dots, which have proven to be excellent single-photon sources, and find that scattering of acoustic phonons leads to excitation-induced dephasing and increased population of the higher energy level which limits the bandwidth of frequency tuning achievable while retaining high indistinguishability. Despite this, for realistic cavity and quantum dot parameters, indistinguishabilities of over $90\\%$ are achievable for energy shifts of up to hundreds of $\\mu$eV, and near-unity indistinguishabilities for energy shifts up to tens of $\\mu$eV. Additionally, we clarify the often-overlooked differences between an idealized Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference experiment and its usual implementation with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, pointing out the subtle differences in the single-photon visibility associated with these different setups.

    "abstract": "Transcorrelated methods provide an efficient way of partially transferring the description of electronic correlations from the ground state wavefunction directly into the underlying Hamiltonian. In particular, Dobrautz et al. [Phys. Rev. B, 99(7), 075119, (2019)] have demonstrated that the use of momentum-space representation, combined with a non-unitary similarity transformation, results in a Hubbard Hamiltonian that possesses a significantly more compact ground state wavefunction, dominated by a single Slater determinant. This compactness/single-reference character greatly facilitates electronic structure calculations. As a consequence, however, the Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian, posing problems for quantum algorithms based on the variational principle. We overcome these limitations with the ansatz-based quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm and apply the transcorrelated method in the context of digital quantum computing. We demonstrate that this approach enables up to 4 orders of magnitude more accurate and compact solutions in various instances of the Hubbard model at intermediate interaction strength ($U/t=4$), enabling the use of shallower quantum circuits for wavefunction ansatzes. In addition, we propose a more efficient implementation of the quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm in quantum circuits that is tailored to non-Hermitian problems. To validate our approach, we perform hardware experiments on the ibmq_lima quantum computer. Our work paves the way for the use of exact transcorrelated methods for the simulations of ab initio systems on quantum computers. ",

    "abstract": "Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for ${}^{171}$Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms. ",
