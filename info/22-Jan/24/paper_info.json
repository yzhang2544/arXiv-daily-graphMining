    "abstract": "Form factor can be engineered in photonic cavities such that it dramatically increases the scan speed of axion haloscope detectors. Using higher-order modes of a photonic cavity, we can probe axions at larger mass ranges beyond the reach of current detectors that rely on conventional copper cavities. The main idea is to produce a higher-order mode with longitudinal field distribution that has relatively high amplitude away from both the cavity axis and the cavity walls such that it results in a relatively large form factor and maintains a high-quality factor. The detector scan speed significantly increases as it is proportional to the square of the form factor multiplied by the quality factor. ",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the radiative interaction between quantum electronic transitions is of general interest. There are two important properties of radiative interaction: the range and the strength. There has been a trade-off between the range and the strength observed in the literature. Such apparent trade-off arises from the dispersion relation of photonic environments. A general recipe is developed to overcome such trade-off and to simultaneously enhance the range and the strength of radiative interactions. ",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make an exciting quasi-2D class of nanocrystals thanks to their unique properties including their highly anisotropic optical transition dipole moment (TDM). Thus, employing a film of CQWs with face-down orientation as an emissive layer (EML) in an electroluminescent device is expected to substantially boost photon outcoupling efficiency. Here, we show all-solution-processed colloidal quantum well light-emitting diodes (CQW-LEDs) using a single all-face-down oriented self-assembled monolayer (SAM) film of CQWs that enables a high level of in-plane (IP) TDMs of 92%. This SAM film significantly enhances the outcoupling efficiency from 22% (of standard randomly-oriented emitters) to 34% (of face-down oriented emitters) and charge injection efficiency. This SAM-CQW-LED architecture enables a record high level of external quantum efficiency of 18.1% for the solution-processed type of CQW-LEDs, putting their efficiency performance on par with the hybrid organic-inorganic evaporation-based CQW-LEDs and all other best solution-processed LEDs. In addition, this architecture provides a high maximum brightness of 19,800 cd/m2 with a long operational lifetime of 247 h at 100 cd/m2 along with saturated deep-red emission (651 nm). These findings indicate the effectiveness of oriented self-assembly of CQWs as electrically-driven emissive layers in improving outcoupling and external quantum efficiencies in the CQW-LEDs. ",

    "abstract": "Laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) engulf exotic and complex conditions ranging in temperature, density, pressure, magnetic and electric fields, charge states, charged particle kinetics, and gas-phase reactions, based on the irradiation conditions, target geometries, and the background cover gas. The application potential of the LPP is so diverse that it generates considerable interest for both basic and applied research areas. Although most of the traditional characterization techniques developed for other plasma sources can be used to characterize the LPPs, care must be taken to interpret the results because of their small size, transient nature, and inhomogeneities. The existence of the large spatiotemporal density and temperature gradients often necessitates non-uniform weighted averaging over distance and time. Among the various plasma characterization tools, optical-based diagnostic tools play a key role in the accurate measurements of LPP parameters. The optical toolbox contains optical probing methods (Thomson scattering, shadowgraphy, Schlieren, interferometry, velocimetry, and deflectometry), optical spectroscopy (emission, absorption, and fluorescence), and passive and active imaging. Each technique is useful for measuring a specific property, and its use is limited to a certain time span during the LPP evolution because of the sensitivity issues related to the selected measuring tool. Therefore, multiple diagnostic tools are essential for a comprehensive insight into the entire plasma behavior. In recent times, the improvements in performance in the lasers and detector systems expanded the capability of the aforementioned passive and active diagnostics tools. This review provides an overview of optical diagnostic tools frequently employed for the characterization of the LPPs and emphasizes techniques, associated assumptions, and challenges. ",

We rationalize the observed behaviour with a model inspired from optomechanics, which couples an intracavity acoustic mode excited by the SAW to a surface deformation eigenmode through amplitude modulation and delayed radiation pressure feedback.

    "abstract": "Researchers have used NMR to measure multi-phase fluid saturation and distribution inside porous media of natural rock. However, the NMR signal amplitude suffers reduction with the increase of temperature. The main reason is the Transverse Overhauser Effect, where heating increases the freedom for ionic motion, affecting spinning behavior by having two spins go in two opposite directions to form the Dipolar Coupling. We approach solving NMR thermal effects correction by melding experimentation and numerical simulation method. We use NMR for Cretaceous carbonate rock multi-phase flow research. We conduct time step in-situ temperature measurement for four different sections of the flooding system at the inlet, center, and outlet along the flooding path. In addition, we conduct a temperature measurement at the NMR device radial axis, representing the permanent magnet temperature. We build a 3D cylindrical heat transfer model for the numerical simulator that simulates thermal effect distribution on the NMR for optimally generating the correction model. The insight provided by the simulator improved the understanding of the thermal distribution at the natural rock core plug to produce a better thermal correction model that meld experimentation and simulation, a method we call Th-CENS.

Recent experiments [arXiv:1711.00887] observed strong decoherence in the quench and longitudinal-field-sweep dynamics of two-dimensional Ising models realized with Lithium-6 Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. This decoherence was conjectured to arise from spin-motion coupling. Here we show that spin-motion coupling indeed leads to decoherence in qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement with the experimental data, treating the difficult spin-motion coupled problem using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation method. We also show that this decoherence will be an important factor to account for in future experiments with Rydberg atoms in optical lattices and microtrap arrays, and discuss methods to mitigate the effect of motion, such as using heavier atoms or deeper traps.
