    "abstract": "The YbF molecule is a sensitive system for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment. The precision of this measurement can be improved by direct laser cooling of the molecules to ultracold temperature. However, low-lying electronic states arising from excitation of a 4f electron may hinder laser cooling. One set of these \"4f hole\" states lies below the $A^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ excited state used for laser cooling, and radiative decay to these intermediate levels, even with branching ratios as small as $10^{-5}$, can be a hindrance. Other 4f hole states lie very close to the $A^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ state, and a perturbation results in states of mixed character that are involved in the laser cooling cycle. This perturbation may enhance the loss of molecules to states outside of the laser cooling cycle. We model the perturbation of the $A^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ state to determine the strength of the coupling between the states, the de-perturbed potential energy curves, and the radiative branching ratios to various vibrational levels of the ground state, $X ^{2}\\Sigma^+$. We use electronic structure calculations to characterise the 4f hole states and the strengths of transitions between these states and the $A^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ and $X ^{2}\\Sigma^+$ states. We identify a leak out of the cooling cycle with a branching ratio of roughly $5 \\times 10^{-4}$, dominated by the contribution of the ground state configuration in a 4f hole state. Finally, we assess the impact of these results for laser cooling of YbF and molecules with similar structure. ",

    "abstract": "The interaction of light with glacier ice is governed by its optical scattering and absorption coefficients. These define apparent optical properties such as albedo and penetration depth of range finding lasers. Prior work has focused on snow or deep ice from cores rather than surface glacial ice. Consequently, the majority of measurements of the absorption coefficient of ice rely on assumptions about optical scattering and reference values derived from snow transmission measurements. Sophisticated physical albedo models only exist for snow, not for glacial surface ice. Here, we demonstrate a measurement technique based on diffuse propagation of nanosecond-duration laser pulses in glacier ice that enables the independent measurement of the scattering and absorption coefficients, allowing for a complete description of the processes governing radiative transfer. We employ a photon-counting detector to overcome the high losses associated with diffuse optics. The instrument is highly portable and rugged, making it optimally suited for deployment in remote regions. A set of measurements taken on Collier Glacier, Oregon, serves as a first demonstration of the technique. These measurements provide insight into both physical structure and composition of glacier ice and open new avenues for the analysis of light-absorbing impurities and remote sensing of the cryosphere.

Given parameterized ansatz circuits representing eigenstates, qOMM implements quantum circuits to represent the objective function in the orbital minimization method and adopts classical optimizer to minimize the objective function with respect to parameters in ansatz circuits. The objective function has orthogonality implicitly embedded, which allows qOMM to apply a different ansatz circuit to each reference state. We carry out numerical simulations that seek to find excited states of the $\\text{H}_{2}$ and $\\text{LiH}$ molecules in the STO-3G basis and UCCSD ansatz circuits. Comparing the numerical results with existing excited states methods, qOMM is less prone to getting stuck in local minima and can achieve convergence with more shallow ansatz circuits. ",

In our experiment, ambient nitrogen (N) plasma is at rest and well-magnetized, and it has uniform mass density. The plasma is pushed by laser-driven ablation aluminum (Al) plasma. Streaked optical pyrometry and spatially resolved laser collective Thomson scattering clarify structures of plasma density and temperatures, which are compared with one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is indicated that just after the laser irradiation, the Al plasma is magnetized by self-generated Biermann battery field, and the plasma slaps the incident N plasma. The compressed external field in the N plasma reflects N ions, leading to counter-streaming magnetized N flows. Namely we identify the edge of the reflected N ions. Such interacting plasmas is forming a magnetized collisionless shock. ",

However, the metasurfaces' performance is tied to the unit cell's efficiency and ultimately the surrounding environment it was designed for, thus reducing its applicability if exposed to altering refractive index media. Here, we report a method to increase a metasurface's versatility by covering the high-index metasurface with a low index porous SiO$_2$ film, protecting the metasurface from environmental changes while keeping the working efficiency unchanged. We show, that a covered metasurface retains its functionality even when exposed to fluidic environments. ",

Particularly, transitions obeying an apparent $F_e-F_g\\equiv\\Delta F =\\pm2$ selection rule, referred to as magnetically-induced (MI) transitions, have their probabilities largely increase in the intermediate interaction regime while being null at zero and higher magnetic fields. With an 800 nm-thick Cs vapor cell placed in a field up to 1.5 kG, we show here that the generation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), realized in $\\Lambda$-systems involving $\\Delta F =- 2$ MI transitions, is only possible when both the coupling and probe beams are $\\sigma^-$-circular polarized, demonstrating that EIT is affected by magnetic circular dichroism. A similar rule of thumb can be extrapolated for $\\Delta F =+2$ MI transitions and $\\sigma^+$ polarization. Because of the high frequency shift slope (typ. 4 MHz/G), the generation of EIT resonances involving MI transitions is interesting, especially in the context of growing attention towards micro-machined alkali vapor cell sensors.

    "abstract": "It remains a challenge to directly print three-dimensional arbitrary shapes that exhibit structural colors at the micrometer scale. Woodpile photonic crystals (WPCs) fabricated via two-photon lithography (TPL) are promising as building blocks to produce 3D geometries that generate structural colors due to their ability to exhibit either omnidirectional or anisotropic photonic stopbands. However, existing approaches have focused on achieving structural colors when illuminating WPCs from the top, which necessitates print resolutions beyond the limit of commercial TPL and/or post-processing techniques. Here, we devised a new strategy to support high-order photonic cavity modes upon side-illumination on WPCs that surprisingly generate large reflectance peaks in the visible spectrum. Based on that, we demonstrate one-step printing of 3D photonic structural colors without requiring post-processing or subwavelength features. Vivid colors with reflectance peaks exhibiting a full width at half maximum of ~25 nm, a maximum reflectance of 50%, gamut of ~85% of sRGB, and large viewing angles, were achieved. In addition, we also demonstrated voxel-level manipulation and control of colors in arbitrary-shaped 3D objects constituted with WPCs as unit cells, which has great potential for applications in dynamic color displays, colorimetric sensing, anti-counterfeiting, and light-matter interaction platforms.

However, most of the investigated structures only support BIC resonances at very few discrete positions in the w~k space, restricting their applications in many fields where random or more input frequencies than the number of supported BIC resonances are required. In this work, we demonstrate that a new set of BIC resonances can be supported by making use of a special composite grating consisting of two ridge arrays with the same period and zero-approaching ridge width difference on a slab waveguide. These BIC resonances are distributed continuously over a broad band along a line in the w~k space and can thus be considered as one-dimensional BICs. With a slight increase of the width difference, these BICs will switch to quasi-BIC modes and it is possible to choose arbitrarily any frequencies on the dispersion line to achieve significantly enhanced light-matter interactions, facilitating many applications where multiple input wavelengths are required, e.g. sum or difference frequency generations in nonlinear optics.

    "abstract": "Advanced nanomaterials with enhanced optical and photocatalytic properties for the photodegradation of organic pollutants, in particular pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), were successfully prepared by a swift one-pot synthesis. Nanostructured materials were synthesized through an integrated hydrothermal procedure which generates titanate nanowires (TNWs) with different carbon dots (C-dots) contents, from an amorphous titanium oxide-based source and cork industry wastewaters (CIWWs) as carbon source. Their structural, microstructural, morphological, and optical properties were studied by XRD, TEM, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. As aimed, the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials extend their light absorption towards the red, in comparison to pristine TNWs, prompting them for a more efficient use of light in photocatalysis by widening the TNWs energy uptake range. The decrease of bandgap energy with increasing sample's C-dots content seems to be originated from energy intermediate states formed within the TNWs forbidden band resulting from Ti-O-C bonds established between the TNWs and the C-dots that form tails of states. The as-synthesized C-dots/TNW samples were tested in the photodegradation of caffeine as a pollutant model. Rewarding results were obtained, with the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials showing significant enhanced photocatalytic ability toward caffeine degradation in comparison to pristine TNWs. Photocatalysis assays in the presence of scavengers and/or in the absence of oxygen were also performed aiming to characterize the most reactive species formed during the semiconductor photo-activation process and thus assessing to possible reactive pathways underpinning the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials.

However, the unexplained degradation of surfaces processed with numerous pulses at high average laser power makes this difficult. Based on a systematic experimental study, the structure formation underlying such surface degradation was investigated. We presented a hierarchical structural formation model that bridges the gap between laser-induced periodic surface structures and surface degradation. Contrary to expectations based on previous research, we observed less structure formation on titanium for high laser fluences. As a possible reason, enhanced electron diffusion with increasing intensity was investigated within the framework of the two-temperature model. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms involved in surface structuring with ultrashort pulses. ",

To overcome this issue, for use in single mode on-chip systems, we propose the incorporation of area-enlarged grating couplers working in conjunction with multimode fibers. This combination enables simpler, faster, and more reliable connections than the traditional small area grating coupler with single-mode fiber. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a 3dB in-plane (X, Y) spatial tolerance of (10.2 {\\mu}m, 17.3 {\\mu}m) for the large area configuration, being at least (2.49, 3.33) times that of the small area one, and agreeing well with theoretical calculations.
