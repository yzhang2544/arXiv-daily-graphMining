The glass-forming ability and glass stability of prepared glass was estimated by Hruby parameter using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TGA). The study of FTIR spectra and X-ray diffraction described the ionic nature and the amorphous pattern of glass respectively. The absorption peaks were observed for the transitions 6H5/2-4P3/2 at 402 nm,6H5/2-4M19/2 at 418 nm, 6H5/2-4I15/2 at 462 nm and 6H5/2-4I11/2 at 478 nm in the absorption spectra. The optical band gap energy (Eg) was calculated and observed to be decreased from 2.95 eV to 1.50 eV with doping concentration. The visible emission band was observed in the Sm3+ doped glass samples. The variation of dielectric constant with frequency was found to be independent for the frequency range 3 kHz - 2 MHz. The measurement of temperature-dependent dc conductivity showed Arrhenius type mechanism of conduction. ",

For very thin boundary layer the scattering properties of the pulse mimics that found from the Fresnel jump conditions for a plane wave - except that the transmission to incident amplitudes are augmented by a factor of $\\sqrt{n_2/n_1}$. As the boundary layer becomes thicker one finds deviations away from the Fresnel conditions and eventually one approaches WKB propagation. However there is found a small but unusual dip in part of the transmitted pulse that persists in time. The quantum lattice algorithm (QLA) used recovers the Maxwell equations to second order in a small parameter -- but QLA still recovers Maxwell equations when this parameter is unity.

    "abstract": "NISQ era devices suffer from a number of challenges like limited qubit connectivity, short coherence times and sizable gate error rates. Thus, quantum algorithms are desired that require shallow circuit depths and low qubit counts to take advantage of these devices. We attempt to realize this with the help of classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit correlation. In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated classically through an approximate similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator with generalized pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron-electron singularities from the Hamiltonian and b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the orbital relaxation effects required for accurate description of the excited states. The resulting transcorelated Hamiltonians are able to describe both ground and excited states of molecular systems in a balanced manner. Using the fermionic-ADAPT-VQE method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we demonstrate that the transcorrelated Hamiltonians can produce ground state energies comparable to the much larger cc-pVTZ basis. This leads to a potential reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than three orders of magnitude for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the qEOM formalism in conjunction with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we reduce the errors in excitation energies by an order of magnitude. The transcorrelated Hamiltonians developed here are Hermitian and contain only one- and two-body interaction terms and thus can be easily combined with any quantum algorithm for accurate electronic structure simulations.

    "abstract": "The field of quantum metrology seeks to apply quantum techniques and/or resources to classical sensing approaches with the goal of enhancing the precision in the estimation of a parameter beyond what can be achieved with classical resources. Theoretically, the fundamental minimum uncertainty in the estimation of a parameter for a given probing state is bounded by the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound. From a practical perspective, it is necessary to find physical measurements that can saturate this fundamental limit and to show experimentally that it is possible to perform measurements with the required precision to do so. Here we perform experiments that saturate the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound for transmission estimation over a wide range of transmissions when probing the system under study with a bright two-mode squeezed state. To properly take into account the imperfections in the generation of the quantum state, we extend our previous theoretical results to incorporate the measured properties of the generated quantum state. For our largest transmission level of 84%, we show a 62% reduction over the optimal classical protocol in the variance in transmission estimation when probing with a bright two-mode squeezed state with 8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing. Given that transmission estimation is an integral part of many sensing protocols, such as plasmonic sensing, spectroscopy, calibration of the quantum efficiency of detectors, etc., the results presented promise to have a significant impact on a number of applications in various fields of research.

We show that precisely analogous phenomena occur generically in electronic and photonic systems where dispersionless flat bands and dispersive bands coexist in the presence of an inhomogeneous potential or medium parameter. We demonstrate that the systems described by the pseudospin-1 Dirac equation with two dispersive bands and one flat band display mode conversion and resonant absorption in a very similar manner to $p$-polarized electromagnetic waves in an unmagnetized plasma by calculating the mode conversion coefficient explicitly using the invariant imbedding method. We also show that a similar mode conversion process takes place in many other systems with a flat band such as pseudospin-2 Dirac systems, continuum models obtained for one-dimensional stub and sawtooth lattices, and two-dimensional electron systems with a quadratic band and a nearly flat band. We discuss some experimental implications of mode conversion in flat-band materials and metamaterials. ",

    "abstract": "Thin membranes are highly sought-after for nanopore-based single-molecule sensing. Fabrication of such membranes becomes challenging in the <10-20 nm thickness regime where a plethora of the work conducting nanopore sensing is reported. Silicon nitride (SiNx) is the ubiquitous choice of material in solid-state nanopore technology and in this work, we present a scalable method to fabricate SiNx membranes with thicknesses of ~5 to ~20 nm using standard silicon processing and chemical etching using hydrofluoric acid (HF). The well-characterized bulk etch rates of SiNx in HF conveniently extend the method to a range of desired thicknesses. The final thicknesses of the membranes were measured using ellipsometry and were in good agreement with the values calculated from the bulk etch rates. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) measurements were used to characterize the membrane chemistry which revealed a stoichiometry and density of the membrane layer to be Si$_3$N$_{3.94 \\pm 0.02}$ and $2.97 \\pm 0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$ respectively. Nanopores were fabricated using the controlled breakdown method with estimated pore diameters down to ~2 nm. The surface charge density was determined by surveying the open pore conductance with changing pH and salt concentration which revealed the surface to be rich in silanol groups (pKa = $~8.0 \\pm 0.4$). Double-stranded DNA was used to probe the translocation characteristics using ~5.5 nm diameter pores. The membrane thicknesses estimated from the translocation measurements agree well with those obtained from ellipsometry. ",

Although recent studies have established a powerful framework to search for and classify topological phases based on symmetry indicators, there exists a large class of fragile topology beyond the description. The Euler class characterizing the topology of two-dimensional real wave functions is an archetypal fragile topology underlying some important properties, such as non-Abelian braiding of crossing nodes and higher-order topology. However, as a minimum model of fragile topology, the two-dimensional topological Euler insulator consisting of three bands remains a significant challenge to be implemented in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize a three-band Hamiltonian to simulate a topological Euler insulator with a trapped-ion quantum simulator. Through quantum state tomography, we successfully evaluate the Euler class, Wilson loop flow and entanglement spectra to show the topological properties of the Hamiltonian. We also measure the Berry phases of the lowest energy band, illustrating the existence of four crossing points protected by the Euler class. The flexibility of the trapped-ion quantum simulator further allows us to probe dynamical topological features including skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs and Hopf links in momentum-time space from quench dynamics. Our results show the advantage of quantum simulation technologies for studying exotic topological phases and open a new avenue for investigating fragile topological phases in experiments. ",

To reveal the underlying microscopic quantum dynamics, a novel strong-field quasi-Hubbard model was developed, which describes the measured optical response dependent on the formation of Cooper pairs. Further, the new theory provides insight into the carrier scattering dynamics and allows to differentiate between the superconducting, pseudo gap, and strange metal phases. The direct connection between non--linear optical response and microscopic dynamics provides a powerful new methodology to study quantum phase transitions in correlated materials.

Subsequently, we employ the Sakurai--Sugiura method to determine resonant frequencies and the Floquet wavenumbers by solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the linear system. We design the shape and topology of the unit elastic material such that the periodic structure has a real resonant wavenumber at a given frequency by minimizing the imaginary part of the resonant wavenumber.

Thanks to recent advances in deep learning, accurate failure predictions are becoming possible even for strongly disordered solids, but the sheer number of parameters used in the process renders a physical interpretation of the results impossible. Here we address this issue and use machine learning methods to predict the failure of simulated two dimensional silica glasses from their initial undeformed structure. We then exploit Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to build attention maps associated with the predictions, and we demonstrate that these maps are amenable to physical interpretation in terms of topological defects and local potential energies. We show that our predictions can be transferred to samples with different shape or size than those used in training, as well as to experimental images. Our strategy illustrates how artificial neural networks trained with numerical simulation results can provide interpretable predictions of the behavior of experimentally measured structures. ",

    "abstract": "Ramsey spectroscopy in large, dense ensembles of ultra-cold atoms trapped in optical lattices suffers from dipole-dipole interaction induced shifts and collective superradiance limiting its precision and accuracy. We propose a novel geometry implementing fast signal readout with minimal heating for large atom numbers at lower densities via an optical cavity operated in the weak single atom but strong collective coupling regime. The key idea is controlled collective transverse $\\pi/2$-excitation of the atoms to prepare a macroscopic collective spin protected from cavity superradiance. This requires that the two halves of the atomic ensemble are coupled to the cavity mode with opposite phase, which is naturally realized for a homogeneously filled volume covering odd and even sites of the cavity mode along the cavity axis. The origin of the superior precision can be traced back to destructive interference among sub-ensembles in the complex nonlinear collective atom field dynamics. In the same configuration we find surprising regular self-pulsing of the cavity output for suitable continuous illumination. Our simulations for large atom numbers employing a cumulant expansion are qualitatively confirmed by a full quantum treatment of smaller ensembles. ",
