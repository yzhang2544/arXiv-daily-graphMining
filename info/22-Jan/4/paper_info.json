    "abstract": "Near-field scanning optical microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging below the diffraction limit, which has been extensively used in bio-medical imaging and nanophotonics. However, when the electromagnetic fields under measurement are strongly confined, they can be heavily perturbed by the presence of the near-field probe itself. Here, taking inspiration from scattering-cancellation invisibility cloaks, Huygens-Kerker scatterers, and cloaked sensors, we design and fabricate a cloaked near-field probe. We show that, by suitably nanostructuring the probe, its electric and magnetic polarizabilities can be controlled and balanced. As a result, probe-induced perturbations can be largely suppressed, effectively cloaking the near-field probe without preventing its ability to measure. We experimentally demonstrate the cloaking effect by comparing the interaction of conventional and nanostructured probes with a representative nanophotonic structure, namely, a 1D photonic-crystal cavity. Our results show that, by engineering the structure of the probe, one can systematically control its back-action on the resonant fields of the sample and decrease the perturbation by >70% with most of our modified probes, and by up to one order of magnitude for the best probe, at probe-sample distances of 100 nm. Our work paves the way for non-invasive near-field optical microscopy of classical and quantum nano-systems. ",

    "abstract": "In a recent work [Bret, EPL \\textbf{135} (2021) 35001], quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects were evaluated for the two-stream instability. It pertains to the growth of perturbations with a wave vector oriented along the flow in a collisionless counter-streaming system. Here, the analysis is extended to every possible orientation of the wave vector. The previous result for the two-stream instability is recovered, and it is proved that even within the framework of a 3D analysis, this instability remains fundamentally 1D even when accounting for QED effects. The filamentation instability, found for wave vectors normal to the flow, is weakly affected by QED corrections. As in the classical case, its growth rate saturates at large $k_\\perp$. The saturation value is found independent of QED corrections. Also, the smallest unstable $k_\\perp$ is independent of QED corrections. Surprisingly, unstable modes found for oblique wave vectors do \\emph{not} follow the same pattern. For some, QED corrections do reduce the growth rate. But for others, the same corrections increase the growth rate instead. The possibility for QED effects to play a role in un-magnetized systems is evaluated. Pair production resulting from gamma emission by particles oscillating in the exponentially growing fields, is not accounting for. ",

    "abstract": "The bound-electron g factor is a stringent tool for tests of the Standard Model and the search for new physics. The comparison between an experiment on the g factor of lithiumlike silicon and the two recent theoretical values revealed the discrepancies of $1.7\\sigma$ [D. A. Glazov $\\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\\textbf{123}$, 173001 (2019)] and $5.2\\sigma$ [V. A. Yerokhin $\\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. A $\\textbf{102}$, 022815 (2020)]. To identify the reason for this disagreement, we accomplish large-scale high-precision computation of the interelectronic-interaction and many-electron QED corrections. The calculations are performed within the extended Furry picture of QED, and the dependence of the final values on the choice of the binding potential is carefully analyzed. As a result, we significantly improve the agreement between the theory and experiment for the g factor of lithiumlike silicon. We also report the most accurate theoretical prediction to date for lithiumlike calcium, which perfectly agrees with the experimental value. ",

Recently, the extension to a three-dimensional imaging modality has paved the way to novel exciting opportunities in the biomedical field, yet the detection of the Brillouin spectrum remains challenging as a consequence of the dominant elastic background light that typically overwhelms the inelastic Brillouin peaks. In this Letter, we demonstrate a fully integrated and ultra-compact Brillouin notch filter based on an optical ring resonator fabricated on a silicon nitride platform. Our on-chip ring resonator filter was measured to have a 10 dB extinction ratio and a Q factor of 1.9x10^5. The experimental results provide a proof-of-concept on the ability of the on-chip filter to attenuate the elastic background light, heralding future developments of fully integrated, ultra-compact and low-cost Brillouin spectrometers.

To do so, we propose an inhomogeneous system in which the nonlinearity of the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric grating is modulated. It is proven that the proposed scheme can be fruitful only if the nonlinearity and its associated modulation terms are assumed to be self-defocusing ones. In order to cut down the intensity required for the steering, the sign of chirping is taken to be negative and the wavelength of operating light is considered to be higher than the Bragg wavelength. Alongside these settings, launching the light from the rear end of the device dramatically reduces the critical intensity to a value of 0.015 (approximately) which must be the lowest switching intensity ever reported in the context of nonlinear $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gratings. The ramp-like stable states in the broken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime prevail even in the company of modulation in the nonlinearity index for both of the light incident directions. ",

The Quantum-Inspired SIBFA procedure is grounded on simplified integrals obtained from localized molecular orbital theory and achieve full separability of its intermolecular potential. It embodies long-range multipolar electrostatics (up to quadrupoles) coupled to a short-range penetration correction (up to quadrupoles), exchange-repulsion, many-body polarization, many-body charge transfer/delocalization, exchange-dispersion and dispersion (up to C10), enabling the reproduction of all energy contributions of ab initio Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT(DFT)) gas phase reference computations. As the derivation of all gradients is presented in the context of their Tinker-HP massively parallel implementation, we introduce a new and computationally tractable transferable formulation of many-body charge transfer. As a proof of concept, we perform a first computational experiment defining a first water model fitted on a limited set of SAPT(DFT) data. SIBFA is shown to enable a satisfactory reproduction of both gas phase energetics and condensed phase properties highlighting the importance of its physically-motivated functional form. ",

    "abstract": "One of the core questions of quantum physics is how to reconcile the unitary evolution of quantum states, which is information-preserving and time-reversible, with the second law of thermodynamics, which is neither. The resolution to this paradox is to recognize that global unitary evolution of a multi-partite quantum state causes the state of local subsystems to evolve towards maximum-entropy states. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this effect in linear quantum optics by simultaneously showing the convergence of local quantum states to a generalized Gibbs ensemble constituting a maximum-entropy state under precisely controlled conditions, while using a new, efficient certification method to demonstrate that the state retains global purity. Our quantum states are manipulated by a programmable integrated photonic quantum processor, which simulates arbitrary non-interacting Hamiltonians, demonstrating the universality of this phenomenon. Our results show the potential of photonic devices for quantum simulations involving non-Gaussian states. ",

We will also argue that whereas Kochen-Specker's is essentially a negative result (a no-go theorem), Gleason's is a positive one since it provides a mathematical justification of Born's rule.

Here we use self-assembly of biomaterial cellulose nanocrystals to obtain three-layer films with helicoidal and nematic-like organization of the cellulose nanoparticles, which mimics naturally occurring polarization-insensitive reflectors found in the wings of Plusiotis resplendens beetles. These films were characterized with polarized optical microscopy and circular dichroism spectrometry, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopies. These films exhibit high reflectivity tunable within the visible and near-infrared regions of the optical spectrum and may find applications ranging from color filters to smart cloth designs and in solar-gain-regulating building technologies.

In solids, the former is for example achieved by individual spins, while the latter is found in semiconducting artificial atoms combined with modern photonic structures. One possible combination of the two aspects is reached by doping a single quantum dot, providing a strong excitonic dipole, with a magnetic ion, that incorporates a characteristic spin texture. Here, we perform four-wave mixing spectroscopy to study the system's quantum coherence properties. We characterize the optical properties of the undoped CdTe quantum dot and find a strong photon echo formation which demonstrates a significant inhomogeneous spectral broadening. Incorporating the Mn$^{2+}$ ion introduces its spin-5/2 texture to the optical spectra via the exchange interaction, manifesting as six individual spectral lines in the coherent response. The random flips of the Mn-spin result in a special type of spectral wandering between the six transition energies, which is fundamentally different from the quasi-continuous spectral wandering that results in the Gaussian inhomogeneous broadening. Here, the discrete spin-ensemble manifests in additional dephasing and oscillation dynamics. ",
