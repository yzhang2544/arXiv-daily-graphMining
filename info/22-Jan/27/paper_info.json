We demonstrate a few centimeter scale 96 keV immersion lens electron source and a 57 keV immersion lens electron source with a 19 kV/mm average acceleration gradient, nearly double the typical 10 kV/mm used in DC electron sources. The brightness of the electron sources is measured alongside start-to-end simulations including space charge effects. These sources are suitable for dielectric laser accelerator experiments, ultrafast electron diffraction, and other applications where a compact high brightness electron source is required. ",

    "abstract": "Topological states enable robust signal propagation within disorder-rich media. These states are defined by integer invariants inextricably tied to the transmission of light, sound, or electrons. However, a challenge remains to exploit topological protection inside a scalable communications platform. Here we use both modelling and experiments to realise photonic crystal fibre that supports topologically protected supermodes. Our fibre exhibits topological guidance for visible light over metre scales, millions of times longer than the wavelength, in contrast to size-limited planar devices and resonance-based metamaterials. We directly measure the photonic winding-number invariant in the bulk and observe the associated boundary modes predicted to exist by bulk-boundary correspondence. By bending this fibre, we reversibly reconfigure its topological states using transverse strain. Future technologies could exploit our scalable fibre platform for topological robustness inherited by lasing modes and entangled quantum states. ",

By deriving the number of times that the laser medium is repeatedly pumped in the light exit area when the light is emitted, the analytical expression of the laser output power is deduced, and the law of the laser output power changing with the laser parameters is obtained. By fitting and comparing with the experimental results, the new model and the experimental results are in good agreement, the related parameters obtained are also very consistent with the literature, and the changes of multiple parameters and temperature are obtained. These results, especially the expression for the analysis of the laser output power pave a new way for the research and design of optical pumped lasers. ",

Both the ionized charge deposited by the particle in the sensor and along the track over the sensor can be collected. The in-pixel circuit mainly consists of a low-noise charge sensitive amplifier to establish the signal for the energy reconstruction, and a discriminator with a Time-to-Amplitude Converter (TAC) for the Time of Arrival (TOA) measurement. With this mechanism, the trajectory, particle hit position, energy and arrival time of the particle can be measured. The analog signal from each pixel is accessible through time-shared multiplexing over the entire pixel array. This paper will discuss the design and preliminary test results of the Topmetal-M sensor.

    "abstract": "A network of agents is considered whose decision processes are described by the quantum decision theory previously advanced by the authors. Decision making is done by evaluating the utility of alternatives, their attractiveness, and the available information, whose combinations form the probabilities to choose a given alternative. As a result of the interplay between these three contributions, the process of choice between several alternatives is multimodal. The agents interact by exchanging information, which can take two forms: (i) information that an agent can directly receive from another agent and (ii) information collectively created by the members of the society. The information field common to all agents tends to smooth out sharp variations in the temporal behaviour of the probabilities and can even remove them. For agents with short-term memory, the probabilities often tend to their limiting values through strong oscillations and, for a range of parameters, these oscillations last for ever, representing an ever lasting hesitation of the decision makers. Switching on the information field makes the amplitude of the oscillations smaller and even can halt the everlasting oscillations forcing the probabilities to converge to fixed limits. The dynamic disjunction effect is described. ",

Accordingly, the effect of the main sections of the laser array system, namely the high-power laser sources, emitting array configuration, and dynamic control system, on the performance of the output coherently combined OAM beams is evaluated, which reveals the system tolerance of perturbative factors and provides the guidance on system design and optimization.

    "abstract": "Insect flight motors are extraordinary natural structures that operate efficiently at high frequencies. Structural resonance is thought to play a role in ensuring efficient motor operation, but the details of this role are elusive. While the efficiency benefits associated with resonance may be significant, a range of counterintuitive behaviours are observed. In particular, the relationship between insect wingbeat frequencies and thoracic natural frequencies are uncertain, with insects showing wingbeat frequency modulation over both short and long timescales. Here, we offer new explanations for this modulation. We show how, in linear and nonlinear models of an indirect flight motor, resonance is not a unitary state at a single frequency; but a complex cluster of distinct and mutually-exclusive states, each representing a different form of resonant optimality. Additionally, by characterising the relationship between resonance and the state of negative work absorption within the motor, we demonstrate how near-perfect negative work absorption can be maintained over significant wingbeat frequency ranges. Our analysis leads to a new conceptual model of flight motor operation: one in which insects are indifferent to their precise wingbeat frequency, and robust to changes in thoracic and environmental properties - illustrating the extraordinary robustness of these natural motors.

Stronger ones are even expected in the future although some technical dificulties must be overcome. In addition, it has been shown that vacuum exhibits a peculiar non-linear behaviour in presence of high magnetic and electric field strengths. In this work we are interested in the analysis of thermodynamical contributions of vacuum to the energy density and pressure when radiation interacts with it in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the Euler-Heisenberg formalism in the regime of weak fields i.e. smaller than critical Quantum Electrodynamics field strength values, we evaluate these magnitudes and analyze the highly anisotropic behaviour we find. Our work has implications for photon-photon scattering with lasers and astrophysically magnetized underdense systems far outside their surface where matter effects are increasingly negligible. ",

They are ubiquitous in physics with applications in different areas such as photonics, nano-electronics, electron microscopy, and quantum information. While the theory developed by Rabi was intended for fermions in gyrating magnetic fields, Autler and Townes realized that it could also be used to describe coherent light-matter interaction within the rotating wave approximation\\cite. Although intense nanometer-wavelength light-sources have been available for more than a decade, Rabi dynamics at such short wavelengths have not been observed directly. Here we show that femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses from a seeded free-electron laser can drive Rabi oscillations between the ground state and an excited state in helium atoms. The measured photoemission signal revealed an Autler-Townes doublet as well as an avoided crossing, phenomena that are both trademarks of quantum optics. Using theoretical analyses that go beyond the strong-field approximation, we found that the ultrafast build-up of the doublet structure follows from a quantum interference effect between resonant and non-resonant photoionization pathways. Given the recent availability of intense attosecond and few-femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses, our results offer opportunities to carry out ultrafast manipulation of coherent processes at short wavelengths using free-electron lasers.
