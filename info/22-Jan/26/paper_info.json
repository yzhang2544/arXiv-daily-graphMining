    "title": "Quantum vacuum processes in the extremely intense light of relativistic  plasma mirror sources",
    "abstract": "The advent of Petawatt-class laser systems allows generating electro-magnetic fields of unprecedented strength in a controlled environment, driving increasingly more efforts to probe yet unobserved processes through their interaction with the quantum vacuum. Still, the lowest intensity scale governing these effects lies orders of magnitude beyond foreseen capabilities, so that such endeavor is expected to remain extremely challenging. In recent years, however, plasma mirrors have emerged as a promising bridge across this gap, by enabling the conversion of intense infrared laser pulses into coherently focused Doppler harmonic beams lying in the X-UV range. In this work, we present quantitative predictions on the quantum vacuum signatures produced when such beams are focused to intensities between $10^{24}$ and $10^{28}$ W.cm$^{-2}$ . These signatures, which notably include photon-photon scattering and electron-positron pair creation, are obtained using state-of-the-art massively parallel numerical tools. In view of identifying experimentally favorable configurations, we also consider the coupling of the focused harmonic beam with an auxiliary optical beam, and provide comparison with other established schemes. Our results show that a single coherently focused harmonic beam can produce as much scattered photons as two infrared pulses in head-on collision, and confirm that the coupling of the harmonic beam to an auxiliary beam gives rise to significant levels of inelastic scattering, and hence holds the potential to strongly improve the attainable signal to noise ratios in experiments.

    "title": "An Experiment to Test the Mechanical Losses of Different Bonding  Techniques in Fused Silica",
    "abstract": "High-purity glasses are used for their low optical and mechanical loss, which makes them an excellent material for oscillators in optical systems, such as inertial sensors. Complex geometries often require the assembly of multiple pieces of glass and their permanent bonding. One common method is hydroxide catalysis bonding, which leaves an enclosed medium layer. This layer has different mechanical properties to the bulk glass around it. The higher mechanical loss of this layer makes it more susceptible to displacement noise originating from the conversion of energy from oscillation to heat and vice versa. Therefore, other methods are needed to bond together glass assemblies. To investigate this, we have set up an experiment to measure the mechanical losses of several different types of bond commonly used in fused silica manufacturing, namely; plasma activated direct bonding, hydroxide catalysis bonding, laser welding, and adhesive bonding. In this paper we present the experimental design and show initial results of the first test sample. ",

    "abstract": "The Rossiter modes of an open cavity were studied using global linear analysis and nonlinear numerical simulations. The length over depth ratio was two and the Reynolds numbers based on cavity depth were close to 1000. The effect of Mach on such cavities was studied. The global analysis revealed that, in the Mach range 0.1 to 0.9, for thick boundary layers, only R1 and R2 modes could become unstable, whereas for thin boundary layer up to R4 could be unstable. Compressibility was very destabilizing at low Mach. At moderate Mach the instability either saturated with Mach or had an irregular dependence. Analysis of the Rossiter mode eigenfunctions indicated that the acoustic feedback scaled to Ma^3, and explained the strong destabilizing effect of compressibility. The irregular dependence was associated with resonances between Rossiter modes and acoustic cavity modes. The analysis explained why the irregular Mach dependence occurred only for higher order Rossiter modes. In this parameter region three dimensional modes are stable or marginally unstable. Two-dimensional simulations were performed to evaluate how much of the nonlinear regime could be captured by the linear stability results. As the flow became more unstable, an increasing more complex final stage was reached. Yet the spectra present distinct tones that are close to linear predictions. However, a closer look reveals the dominant frequency in the saturated state corresponds to R1 while linear theory predicts R2 as the most unstable mode. This is associated with a nonlinear thickening of the mixing layer in the nonlinear regime. Moreover, the frequencies are much closer to Rossiter empirical predictions than the linear instability ones. Even at these conditions close to critical, the spectra are well described by the mode R1 and a cascade of nonlinearly generated harmonics, with no reminiscence of the linear instability. ",

    "abstract": "Both spontaneous emission and resonant energy transfer can be enhanced significantly when the emitter is placed in the vicinity of metallic or crystal structures. This enhancement can be described using the electromagnetic Green tensor and is determined by the dominant surface modes of the structure. Here we use the eigenpermittivity formalism to derive the spontaneous emission and FRET rates in the quasistatic regime in a two-constituent medium with an anisotropic inclusion. We then apply our results to a helical structure supporting synchronous vibrations and evaluate the contribution of these modes, which are associated with a strong and delocalized response. We show that this contribution can result in large Purcell factors and long-range FRET, which oscillates with the helix pitch. These findings may have implications in understanding and controlling the interactions of molecules close to helical structures such as the microtubules. ",

The model follows the relaxation-time approximation, but the collision frequency (i.e, inverse relaxation time) is a function of the molecular velocity to reflect part of the collision details of the Boltzmann equation, and the target velocity distribution function (VDF) to which the VDF relaxes is close to that used in the Shakhov model. Based on the numerical simulation of strong non-equilibrium shock waves, a half-theoretical and half-empirical collision frequency is designed for different intermolecular potentials: the $\\nu$-model shows significantly improved accuracy, and the underlying mechanism is analysed. The $\\nu$-model also performs well in canonical rarefied micro-flows, especially in the thermal transpiration, where the conventional kinetic models with velocity-independent collision frequency lack the capability to distinguish the influence of intermolecular potentials.

We obtain dual pulse generation with 20-fold difference in the duration, by setting the net cavity group delay dispersion to cross zero across the emission band of the employed gain medium. While the duration of the soliton-like pulses experiencing anomalous dispersion amounts to 117 fs, the second laser output that is spectrally located in the normal dispersion region, is strongly chirped with a pulse duration of 2360 fs.

The vacuum contribution to the physical observables leads to ultra-violet divergences, that are removed by a charge renormalization. The remaining vacuum contribution is small, and is in agreement with previously derived expressions for the time-dependent vacuum polarization. The main new feature of the theory is a damping mechanism similar to Landau damping, but where the plasmon energy give rise to creation of electron-positron pairs. The dependence of the damping rate (pair-creation rate) on wave-number, temperature, and density is analyzed. Finally, the analytical results of linearized theory are compared. ",

Given their coefficients, wave equations can be solved to high accuracy, but the presence of the wavelength scale often leads to large computer simulations for anything beyond the simplest geometries. The inverse problem, determining the coefficients from a field on a boundary, is even more demanding, since traditional optimization requires a large number of forward problems be solved sequentially. Here we show that the free-form inverse problem of wave equations can be solved with machine learning. First we show that deep neural networks can be used to predict the optical properties of nanostructured materials such as metasurfaces. Then we demonstrate the free-form inverse design of such nanostructures and show that constraints imposed by experimental feasibility can be taken into account. Our neural networks promise automated design in several technologies based on the wave equation. ",

In one example, we found the cost of ph-AFQMC per sample to increase only by a factor of about $3$ for a calculation with $10^4$ configurations compared to that with a single one, demonstrating the tiny computational overhead due to a longer expansion. This favorable scaling allows us to study the systematic convergence of the phaseless bias in AFQMC calculations with an increasing number of configurations and provides a means to gauge the accuracy of ph-AFQMC with other trial states. We also show how the scalability issues of sCI trial states for large system sizes could be mitigated by restricting them to a moderately sized orbital active space and leveraging the near-cancellation of out of active space phaseless errors.
