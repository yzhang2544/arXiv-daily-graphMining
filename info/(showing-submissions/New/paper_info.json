    "abstract": "           A single mechanism, endemic to the standard model of physics, is proposed to explain wavefunction collapse, classical motion, dissipation, equilibration, and the transition from pure quantum mechanics through open system decoherence to the natural regime. Spontaneous events in the neighborhood of a particle disrupts correlation such that large many-particle states do not persist and each particle collapses to a stable mode of motion established by its neighbors. These events are the source of thermal fluctuation and drive diffusion. Consequently, evolution is not deterministic, unitary or classically conservative; diffusion toward a steady state occurs incessantly in every system of particles, though slowed under unnatural experimental conditions that suppress these events. Mean properties of a system evolve as particles jump between single-particle modes, producing observed transport laws and equilibrium properties without additional postulate or empirical factors. These modes are localized in dense material, yielding classical characteristics. Boltzmann's equal probability postulate is valid only when comparing results of nonrelativistic observers.         ",

    "abstract": "           Two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) is a low-frequency analogue of two-dimensional optical spectroscopy that is rapidly maturing as a probe of a wide variety of condensed matter systems. However, a persistent problem of 2DTS is the long experimental acquisition times, preventing its broader adoption. A potential solution, requiring no increase in experimental complexity, is signal reconstruction via compressive sensing. In this work, we apply the sparse exponential mode analysis (SEMA) technique to 2DTS of a cuprate superconductor. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm in reconstructing the terahertz nonlinearities and find that SEMA reproduces the asymmetric photon echo lineshapes with as low as a 10% sampling rate and reaches the reconstruction noise floor with beyond 20-30% sampling rate. The success of SEMA in reproducing such subtle, asymmetric lineshapes confirms compressive sensing as a general method to accelerate 2DTS and multidimensional spectroscopies more broadly.         ",

Thus, the task of the design team was to adapt the prototype circuity of AD820 to our technological capabilities, modify the circuit, if necessary, to eliminate any deficiency of the prototype. The input stage module got source followers at the input of the operational amplifier. Second stage module was modified to be more symmetric. The output stage module obtained additional resistors and capacitors to achieve a frequency compensation. One FET transistor in the current reference module was substituted by other elements. Simplified electric schemes of these modules of AR820 and aRD820 are presented. The performance of modified electric schemes of modules was tested in Simulink software. Simulations of the full electric scheme for aRD820 were made and showed that it demonstrates similar characteristics as AD820 data tables.

    "abstract": "           High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a material sample is irradiated by intense laser pulses, causing the emission of high harmonics of the incident light. HHG has historically been explained by theories employing a classical electromagnetic field, successfully capturing its spectral and temporal characteristics. However, recent research indicates that quantum-optical effects naturally exist, or can be artificially induced, in HHG. Even though the fundamental equations of motion for quantum electrodynamics (QED) are well-known, a unifying framework for solving them to explore HHG is missing. So far, numerical solutions employed a wide range of basis-sets and untested approximations. Based on methods originally developed for cavity polaritonics, here we formulate a numerically accurate QED model consisting of a single active electron and a single quantized photon mode. Our framework can in principle be extended to higher electronic dimensions and multiple photon modes to be employed in ab initio codes. We employ it as a model of an atom interacting with a photon mode and predict a characteristic minimum structure in the HHG yield vs. phase-squeezing. We find that this phenomenon, which can be used for novel ultrafast quantum spectroscopies, is partially captured by a multi-trajectory Ehrenfest dynamics approach, with the exact minima position sensitive to the level of theory. On the one hand, this motivates using multi-trajectory approaches as an alternative for costly exact calculations. On the other hand, it suggests an inherent limitation of the multi-trajectory formalism, indicating the presence of entanglement. Our work creates a road-map for a universal formalism of QED-HHG that can be employed for benchmarking approximate theories, predicting novel phenomena for advancing quantum applications, and for the measurements of entanglement and entropy.

    "abstract": "           Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.         ",

Common analytical approximations to the radiative transfer equation (RTE) fail to predict light transport and could even give unphysical results. Therefore, we experimentally probe the position-dependent energy fluence rate of light inside scattering samples where the widely used P1 and P3 approximations to the RTE fail. The samples are three-dimensional (3D) aqueous suspensions of anisotropically scattering and both absorbing and non-absorbing spherical scatterers, namely, microspheres (r = 0.5 um) with and without absorbing dye. To probe the energy fluence rate, we detect the emission of quantum-dot reporter particles that are excited by the incident light and that are contained in a thin capillary. By scanning the capillary through the sample, we access the position dependence. We present a comprehensive discussion of experimental limitations and of both random and systematic errors. Our observations agree well with the Monte Carlo simulations and the P3 approximation of the RTE with a correction for forward scattering. In contrast, the P1 and the P3 approximations deviate increasingly from our observations, ultimately even predicting unphysical negative energies.         ",

    "title": "Introducing Quantum Information and Computation to a Broader Audience with MOOCs at OpenHPI",
    "abstract": "           Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, many approaches to teaching quantum computing are being developed worldwide. This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors taught a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The purpose of the platform is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of more than 17{,}000 course attendances have been taken by about 7400 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behaviour in the courses, and their learning success. This paper is the first to analyze such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatated with following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners provides many avenues for further research in the field of quantum computing education. The analyses show that the MOOCs are a low-threshold concept for getting into quantum computing. It was very well received by the participants. The concept can serve as an entry point and guide for the design of quantum computing courses.         ",

    "abstract": "           The Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset attempts to more comprehensively cover all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers at state of the art level of theory. We have used density functional theory ($\\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers. Isomers included contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of $p$-block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of all the lowest conformers (10,793 molecules) with up to 4 heavy atoms. This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules as implemented in the {\\tt SURGE} package), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV, molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (alchemical potential), Mulliken charges, and molecular wavefunctions. Machine learning (ML) models on the 258k constitutional isomers indicate an upto $\\sim$8 times more challenging benchmark than the commonly used QM9 dataset. VQM24 represents a highly accurate and unbiased dataset of molecules, ideal for testing and training transferable, scalable, and generative ML models of real quantum systems.         ",

    "abstract": "           We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.         ",

    "title": "Unraveling Optical Polarization at Deep Microscopic Scales in Crystalline Materials",
    "abstract": "           Nanophotonics, the study of light-matter interaction at scales smaller than the wavelength of radiation, has widespread applications in plasmonic waveguiding, topological photonic crystals, super-lensing, solar absorbers, and infrared imaging. The physical phenomena governing these effects can be described using a macroscopic homogenized refractive index. However, the lattice-level description of optical polarization in a crystalline material using a quantum theory has been unresolved. Inspired by the dynamics of electron waves and their corresponding band structure, we propose a microscopic optical band theory of solids specifically applicable to optical polarization. This framework reveals propagating waves hidden deep within a crystal lattice. These hidden waves arise from crystal-optical-indices, a family of quantum functions obeying crystal symmetries, and cannot be described by the conventional concept of refractive index. We present for the first time - the hidden waves and deep microscopic optical band structure of 14 distinct materials. We choose Si, Ge, InAs, GaAs, CdTe, and others from Group IV, III-V, and II-VI due to their technological relevance but our framework can be extended to a wide range of emerging 2D and 3D materials. In contrast to the macroscopic refractive index of these materials used widely today, this framework shows that hidden waves exist throughout the crystal lattice and have unique optical polarization texture and crowding. We also present an open-source software package, Purdue-Picomax, for the research community to discover hidden waves in new materials like hBN, graphene, and Moire materials. Our work establishes a foundational crystallographic feature to discover novel deep microscopic optical waves in light-matter interaction.         ",

    "abstract": "           Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.
