    "title": "Quantum panprotopsychism and the combination problem",
    "abstract": "We will argue that a phenomenological analysis of consciousness, similar to that of Husserl, shows that the effects of phenomenal qualities shape our perception of the world. It also shows the way the physical and mathematical sciences operate, allowing us to accurately describe the observed regularities in terms of communicable mathematical laws. The latter say nothing about the intrinsic features of things. They only refer to the observed regularities in their behaviors, providing rigorous descriptions of how the universe works, to which any viable ontology must conform. Classical mechanistic determinism limits everything that can occur to what happens in an instant and leaves no room for novelty or any intrinsic aspect that is not epiphenomenal. The situation changes with quantum probabilistic determinism if one takes seriously the ontology that arises from its axioms of objects, systems in certain states, and the events they produce in other objects. As Bertrand Russell pointed out almost a century ago, an ontology of events, with an internal phenomenal aspect, now known as panprotopsychism, is better suited to explaining the phenomenal aspects of consciousness. The central observation of this paper is that many objections to panpsychism and panprotopsychism, which are usually called the combination problem, arise from implicit hypotheses based on classical physics about supervenience. These are inappropriate at the quantum level, where an exponential number of emergent properties and states arise. The analysis imposes conditions on the possible implementations of quantum cognition mechanisms in the brain. ",

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate the in-situ characterization of optical micro/nano fibers (MNFs).The MNF (test fiber, TF) is positioned on a microfiber (probe fiber, PF) and simulated for the scattering loss at various PF and TF diameters. The TF is fabricated using chemical etching technique. The PF is a conventional single-mode fiber with an outer diameter of 125 um. We measure the scattering loss along the TF axis at various positions i.e. diameters by mounting it on the PF. The diameter profile of the TF is inferred from the measured scattering loss and correlated with its surface morphology measurement. This work demonstrates an effective, low-cost, and non-destructive method for in-situ characterization of fabricated micro/nano fibers (OMNFs). It can detect and determine the irregularities on the surface of OMNFs. It can also be used to quantify the local evanescent field. Detecting such local points can improve studies that are carried out using these fields in various sensing and related study domains. It is simple to implement and can be accessed by all domains of researchers. ",

The proposed 4-port network shows an invariant circuit topology to the PPS geometry and is completely comprised of invariant-frequency lumped elements. The circuit is the simplest in terms of number of elements within the bi-mode bandwidth for a certain geometry, and its topology makes it possible both a standardized process to obtain the equivalent circuit of an arbitrary geometry and the use of the circuit theory to design a multitude of devices. To perform a validation, the equivalent circuit of two different PPSs (a rotated dipole and a defected slotted ring) have been obtained and analyzed in single and multi-layer configurations. The circuit is also used as a tool to develop Elliptical to Linear (or Circular) Polarization converters. One of the designs presented at 20 GHz (in transmission) converts an incident elliptical polarization of Axial Ratio 5 and tilted 20 deg into a purely linear vertical polarization of XP<-30 dB, with near-zero reflections and insertion loss better than 0.1 dB. The designed device is also manufactured and tested, and the measurements are in good agreement with simulations. ",

The underlying mechanism is attributed to the geometric phase originating from the longitudinal spin of light.

Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the rotation of a metallic nano bar sitting on a metal substrate can induce a geometric phase covering 2$\\pi$ full range for the surface plasmons carrying intrinsic transverse spin. Specially, the geometric phase is different for the surface plasmons propagating in opposite directions due to spin-momentum locking. We apply the geometric phase to design metasurfaces to manipulate the wavefront of surface plasmons to achieve steering and focusing. Our work provides a new mechanism for on-chip light manipulations with potential applications in designing ultra-compact optical devices for imaging and sensing. ",

This creates incommensurability between the two species along the planes of the layers, resulting in spontaneous symmetry-break periodic ripples in the \\textit{a}-axis orientation. Nevertheless, natural franckeite heterostructure has shown potential for optoelectronic applications mostly because it is a semiconductor with 0.7 eV bandgap, air-stable, and can be easily exfoliated down to ultrathin thicknesses. Here, we demonstrate that few-layer franckeite shows a highly anisotropic nonlinear optical response due to its lattice structure, which allow for the identification of the ripple axis. Moreover, we find that the highly anisotropic third-harmonic emission strongly varies with material thickness. These features are further corroborated by a theoretical nonlinear susceptibility model and the nonlinear transfer matrix method. Overall, our findings help to understand this material and propose a characterization method that could be used in other layered materials and heterostructures to assign their characteristic axes. ",

To date, a scalable optical memory with optical control has remained an open problem. Here we report an integrated photonic set-reset latch as a fundamental optical static memory unit based on universal optical logic gates. While the proposed memory is compatible with different photonic platforms, its functionality is demonstrated on a programmable silicon photonic chip as a proof of concept. Optical set, reset, and complementary outputs, scalability to a large number of memory units via the independent latch supply light, and compatibility with different photonic platforms enable more efficient and lower latency optical processing systems.

Rear-end collisions occurring periodically in a full acceptance particle detector/polarimeter, allow the (previously inaccessible) direct measurement of the spin dependence of nuclear transmutation for center of mass (CM) kinetic energies (KE) ranging from hundreds of keV up toward pion production thresholds. With the nuclear process occurring in a semi-relativistic moving frame, all initial and final state particles have convenient laboratory frame KEs in the tens to hundreds of MeV. The rear-end collisions occur as faster stored bunches pass through slower bunches. An inexpensive facility capable of meeting these requirements is described, with several nuclear channels as examples. Especially noteworthy are the $e^{+/-}$-induced weak interaction triton (t) $\\beta$-decay processes, t + $e^+ \\rightarrow$ h + $\\nu$ and h + $e^- \\rightarrow$ t + $\\nu$. Experimental capability of measurement of the spin dependence of the induced triton case is emphasized. For cosmological nuclear physics, the experimental improvement will be produced by the storage ring's capability to investigate the spin dependence of nuclear transmutation processes at reduced kinetic energies compared to what can be obtained with fixed target geometry.

The device was subjected to a wide range of vibration frequencies, from 1 mHz to 30 Hz, and accelerations from 0.76 mg to 29.64 mg, and performed linearly, with a sensitivity of 2.213 nW/mg. Therefore, we believe the accelerometer reported here may represent an alternative to existing electronic and optical accelerometers, especially for low frequency and amplitude vibrations, thanks to its compactness, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, implementation easiness and high sensitivity.

This is achieved by simultaneous current injection into the two disconnected perimeters of a multi-terminal Corbino device to balance the electrochemical potential between the edges, screening the electric field that drives back-scattering through the bulk, and thus improving the stability of the quantization at increased currents.
