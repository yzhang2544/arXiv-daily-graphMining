    "title": "An image-based transfer learning approach for using in situ processing  data to predict laser powder bed fusion additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V  mechanical properties",
    "abstract": "The mitigation of material defects from additive manufacturing (AM) processes is critical to reliability in their fabricated parts and is enabled by modeling the complex relations between available build monitoring signals and final mechanical performance. To this end, the present study investigates a machine learning approach for predicting mechanical properties for Ti-6Al-4V fabricated through laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) AM using in situ photodiode processing signals. Samples were fabricated under different processing parameters, varying laser powers and scan speeds for the purpose of probing a wide range of microstructure and property variations. Photodiode data were collected during fabrication, later to be arranged in image format and extracted to information-dense vectors by the transferal of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) structures and weights pre-trained on a large computer vision benchmark image database. The extracted features were then used to train and test a newly designed regression model for mechanical properties. Average cross-validation accuracies were found to be 98.7% (r2 value of 0.89) for the prediction of ultimate tensile strength, which ranged from 900 to 1150 MPa in the samples studied, and 93.1% (r2 value of 0.96) for the prediction of elongation to fracture, which ranged from 0 to 17%. Thus, with high accuracy and hardware accelerated inference speeds, we demonstrate that a transfer learning framework can be used to predict strength and ductility of metal AM components based on processing signals in PBF-LB, illustrating a potential route toward real-time closed-loop control and process optimization of PBF-LB in industrial applications.

    "title": "Dynamic control of 2D non-Hermitian photonic corner states in synthetic  dimensions",
    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian models describe the physics of ubiquitous open systems with gain and loss. One intriguing aspect of non-Hermitian models is their inherent topology that can produce intriguing boundary phenomena like resilient higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) and non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSE). Recently, time-multiplexed lattices in synthetic dimensions have emerged as a versatile platform for the investigation of these effects free of geometric restrictions. Despite holding broad applications, studies of these effects have been limited to static cases so far, and full dynamical control over the non-Hermitian effects has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of topological non-Hermitian corner states with remarkable temporal controllability and robustness in a two-dimensional photonic synthetic time lattice. Specifically, we showcase various dynamic control mechanisms for light confinement and flow, including spatial mode tapering, sequential non-Hermiticity on-off switching, dynamical corner state relocation, and light steering. Moreover, we establish the corner state's robustness in the presence of intensity modulation randomness and quantitatively determine its breakdown regime. Our findings extend non-Hermitian and topological photonic effects into higher synthetic dimensions, offering remarkable flexibility and real-time control possibilities. This opens avenues for topological classification, quantum walk simulations of many-body dynamics, and robust Floquet engineering, free from the limitations of physical geometries. ",

    "abstract": "This paper combines mathematical, philosophical, and historical analyses in a comprehensive investigation of the dynamical foundations of the formalism of orthodox quantum mechanics. The results obtained include: (i) A deduction of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) from the tenets of Matrix Mechanics; (ii) A discussion of the meaning of Schr\\\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation that not only improves on Joas and Lehner's 2009 investigation on the subject but also demonstrates that the CCR follow of necessity from Schr\\\"odinger's first derivation of the wave equation, thus correcting the common misconception that the CCR were only posited by Schr\\\"odinger to pursue equivalence with Matrix Mechanics; (iii) A discussion of the mathematical facts and requirements involved in the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics that improves on F. A. Muller's classical treatment of the subject; (iv) A proof that the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics is necessitated by the formal requirements of a dual action functional from which both the dynamical postulates of orthodox quantum mechanics, von Neumann's process 1 and process 2, follow; (v) A critical assessment, based on (iii) and (iv), of von Neumann's construction of unified quantum mechanics over Hilbert space. Point (iv) is our main result. It brings to the open the important, but hitherto ignored, fact that orthodox quantum mechanics is no exception to the golden rule of physics that the dynamics of a physical theory must follow from the action functional. If orthodox quantum mechanics, based as it is on the assumption of the equivalence of Matrix and Wave Mechanics, has this \"peculiar dual dynamics,\" as von Neumann called it, this is so because by assuming the equivalence one has been assuming a peculiar dual action.

Benefiting from the valley-locked propagation mode at the interface of TPCs with different topological phases, the proposed power splitter has negligible backscattering around the sharp bendings and good robustness to fabrication defects, which therefore enable lower insertion loss, better uniformity, and more compact footprint than the conventional designs. For the fabricated 1*2 (8) power splitter, the uniformity among the output ports is below 0.35 (0.65) dB and the maximum insertion loss is 0.38 (0.58) dB with compact footprint of 5*5 um2 (10*12 um2) within a bandwidth of 70 nm. In addition, the topological power splitter only requires simple configurations of TPCs with different topological phases, which is more reliable in design and fabrication compared with the conventional designs.

The feature size of the PSR is 1.5 {\\mu}m, which can be fabricated with low priced i-line contact aligners. Experimental results show a polarization extinction ratio (PER) > 20 dB and insertion loss (IL) <1.5 dB are achieved in a wavelength range of 1542-1600 nm for TE-polarized light. And a PER > 9.5 dB and an IL <3.0 dB are achieved in a wavelength range of 1561-1600 nm for TM-polarized light. This PSR could find application in the low-cost fabrication of dual-polarization TFLN integrated photonic devices. ",

    "abstract": "Whispering gallery mode (WGM) of resonance occurs when a traveling wave faces grazing reflection and confinement at the inner surface of a spherical cavity. Such a resonance was observed with micrometer sized liquid droplet and with light of sub-micron wavelength. The resonance occurs when specific boundary conditions are fulfilled, following a relation between optical path length (that is related to radius of the droplet) and resonating wavelength. Therefore, a change in WGM wavelength will be related to dimension of the droplet. We observed a shift in such a resonance spectra. For a smaller droplet the observed blue shift in the WGM were 1.5, 0.7, 3.7 nm. Following the resonance condition, it was estimated that such a shift corresponds to a reduction in radius of the droplet by 1.3, 0.6, 3.3 nm respectively. This was obtained with a droplet of radius about 600 nm. The droplet was created from a solution of glycerol, methanol and rhodamine 6G dye, and was trapped and levitated in a modified Paul trap. The WGMs were created by optically exciting the dye material from an external 532 nm cw laser beam. A shift in the WGM was observed with time, during a gradual increase in power of the excitation laser, and a reason for such a shift was thought to be thermal evaporation of the liquid from the droplet. For a larger droplet an initial 0.1 nm thermal expansion was also estimated because initially a red-shift of the WGM was observed, probably because of thermal expansion, which was negligible for a smaller droplet. For the smaller droplet, the estimated rate of change of WGM with radius, was 1.129. For larger droplet, this rate is lower. ",

Subwavelength periodic nanostructures provide precise control of the propagation of light and sound in silicon photonic circuits, key to maximize the efficiency of Brillouin interactions. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new subwavelength waveguide geometry allowing independent control of optical and mechanical modes. Two silicon lattices are combined, one with a subwavelength period for the light and one with a total bandgap for the sound, to confine optical and mechanical modes, respectively. Based on this approach, we experimentally demonstrate optomechanical coupling between near-infrared optical modes and GHz mechanical modes with with 5-8 MHz linewidth and a coupling strength of GB = 1360 1/(W m). A Stokes gain of 1.5 dB, and anti-Stoke loss of -2 dB are observed for a 6 mm-long waveguide with 35.5 mW of input power. We show tuning of the mechanical frequency between 5 and 8 GHz by geometrical optimization, without loss of the optomechanical coupling strength. ",

Here we present experimental evidence that optical nonlinearities in doped semiconductors are due to free-electron and their efficiency could exceed by several orders of magnitude that of conventional dielectric nonlinearities. Our experimental findings are supported by comprehensive computational results based on the hydrodynamic modeling, which naturally includes nonlocal effects, of the free-electron dynamics in heavily doped semiconductors. By studying third-harmonic generation from plasmonic nanoantenna arrays made out of heavily n-doped InGaAs with increasing levels of free-carrier density, we discriminate between hydrodynamic and dielectric nonlinearities. As a result, the value of maximum nonlinear efficiency as well as its spectral location can now be controlled by tuning the doping level. Having employed the common material platform InGaAs/InP that supports integrated waveguides, our findings pave the way for future exploitation of plasmonic nonlinearities in all-semiconductor photonic integrated circuits.

For experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we map out the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and the target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multi-band lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. While the agreement between quantum simulator and single-band models is good for deep optical lattices with weaker interactions and low particle densities, the higher band population rapidly increases for shallow lattices, stronger interactions, and in particular above half filling. This induces drastic changes to the properties of the simulated ground state, potentially leading to false predictions. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between commensurability and interactions can lead to quasidegeneracies, rendering a faithful ground state preparation even more challenging. ",

Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.
