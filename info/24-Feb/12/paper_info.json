    "title": "Enhanced Frequency Conversion in Parity-Time Symmetry Line",
    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian degeneracies reveal intriguing and non-trivial behaviors in open physical systems. Examples like Parity-Time (PT) symmetry breaking, topological encircling chirality, and enhanced sensing near an exceptional point (EP) are often associated with the abrupt nature of the phase transition around these degeneracies. Here we experimentally observe a cavity-enhanced second-harmonic frequency (SHG) conversion on a PT symmetry line, i.e. a set consisting of open-ended isofrequency or isoloss lines, both terminated at EPs on the Riemann surface in parameter space. The enhancement factor can reach as high as 300, depending on the crossing point whether in the symmetry or the broken phase of the PT line. Moreover, such enhancement of SHG enables sensitive distance sensing with a nanometer resolution. Our works may pave the way for practical applications in sensing, frequency conversion, and coherent wave control. ",

    "abstract": "Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) allows printing of mesoscopic objects within seconds or minutes. Tomographic patterns are illuminated onto a rotating glass vial which contains a photosensitive resin. Current pattern optimization is based on a ray optical assumption which ultimately leads to limited resolution around $20\\mu\\textrm{m}$ and varying throughout the volume of the 3D object. In this work, we introduce a rigorous wave-based optical amplitude optimization scheme for TVAM which shows that high-resolution printing is theoretically possible over the full volume. The wave optical optimization approach is based on an efficient angular spectrum method of plane waves with custom written memory efficient gradients and allows for optimization of realistic volumes for TVAM such as $(100\\mu\\textrm{m})^3$ or $(10\\textrm{mm})^3$ with $550^3$ voxels and 600 angles. Our simulations show that ray-optics start to produce artifacts when the desired features are $20\\mu\\textrm{m}$ and below and more importantly, the amplitude modulated TVAM can reach micrometer features when optimizing the patterns using a full wave model.

However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional ion confinement techniques predominantly rely on external fields to achieve precise and stable confinement. This study introduces a new approach to ion confinement by harnessing the quantum Zeno effect. Through the continual measurement of the force on conductor plates, we offer a novel means of maintaining ion confinement without the direct application of external forces. We argue that this method potentially addresses the challenges of heating, control, and scalability associated with traditional ion-trapping methods. The findings present ground-state solutions for two ions confined to various regions, detailing the frequency of measurements necessary for each confinement regime. These results highlight conservative bounds for the power requirements associated with each scenario, offering insights into the energy efficiency of the method. Although this method is promising, with potential applications ranging from quantum computing to atomic clocks, it requires experimental validation. We posit that the proposed method might be better suited to challenges requiring smaller ion confinements, such as fusion, which will be explored in an upcoming study. ",

    "title": "Quantum thermodynamics with a single superconducting vortex",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate complete control over dynamics of a single superconducting vortex in a nanostructure which we coin the Single Vortex Box (SVB). Our device allows us to trap the vortex in a field-cooled aluminum nanosquare and expel it on demand with a nanosecond pulse of electrical current. We read-out the vortex state of the box by testing the switching current of the adjacent Dayem nanobridge. Using the time-resolving nanothermometry we measure 4$\\cdot$10$^{-19}\\,$J as the amount of the dissipated heat (which is the energy of a single red photon) in the elementary process of the vortex expulsion, and monitor the following thermal relaxation of the device. The measured heat is equal to the energy required to annihilate all Cooper pairs on the way of the moving vortex. Our design and measuring protocol are convenient for studying the stochastic mechanism of the vortex escape from current-driven superconducting nanowires, which has its roots either in thermal or quantum fluctuations, similar to ones widely studied in Josephson junctions or magnetic nanoclusters and molecules. Our experiment enlightens the thermodynamics of the absorption process in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, in which vortices are perceived to be essential for a formation of a detectable hot spot. The demonstrated opportunity to manipulate a single superconducting vortex reliably in a confined geometry comprises in fact a proof-of-concept of a nanoscale non-volatile memory cell with sub-nanosecond write and read operations, which offers compatibility with quantum processors based either on superconducting qubits or rapid single flux quantum circuits.

    "abstract": "In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\\rm c}$ is ever mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In $T_{\\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB corrections usually suppress $T_{\\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a universal feature in multiband superconductivity.

    "title": "Flexible, photonic films of surfactant-functionalized cellulose  nanocrystals for pressure and humidity sensing",
    "abstract": "Most paints contain pigments that absorb light and fade over time. A robust alternative can be found in nature, where structural coloration arises from the interference of light with submicron features. Plant-derived, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mimic these features by self-assembling into a cholesteric liquid crystal that exhibits structural coloration when dried. While much research has been done on CNCs in aqueous solutions, less is known about transferring CNCs to apolar solvents that are widely employed in paints. This study uses a common surfactant in agricultural and industrial products to suspend CNCs in toluene that are then dried into structurally colored films. Surprisingly, a stable liquid crystal phase is formed within hours, even with concentrations of up to 50 wt.-%. Evaporating the apolar CNC suspensions results in photonic films with peak wavelengths ranging from 660 to 920 nm. The resulting flexible films show increased mechanical strength, enabling a blue-shift into the visible spectrum with applied force. The films also act as humidity sensors, with increasing relative humidity yielding a red-shift. With the addition of a single surfactant, CNCs can be made compatible with existing production methods of industrial coatings, while improving the strength and responsiveness of structurally-colored films to external stimuli.

    "abstract": "Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed. ",
