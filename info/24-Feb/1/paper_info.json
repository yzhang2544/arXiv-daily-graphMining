    "abstract": "New microscopic geodesics with local balances of kinetic and metric four-potentials can maintain the non-local mass mechanism of continuous matterspace due to positive energies of kinetic micro-oscillations. The monistic pan-unity of the inertial continuum of kinetic energy is quantitatively substantiated by the Lomonosov local push on macroscopic densities in inverse square interactions of visible bodies. The monistic mechanics of inertial fields replaces the dual model of separated particles and their pulling fields or forces at a distance. The positive kinetic pressure of Poincare withstands the metric stress for equilibrium densities and prevents the radial collapse of non-local self-organizations, despite the observed fall of probe (extremely dense) densities in rarefied regions of the correlated continuum of the emerging mass-energy. The four-dimensional geometrization with the inherent sub-symmetries for flat matterspace and adaptive kinetic-metric time can be useful for modeling stationary and auto-pulsing astrosystems, as well as for the modeling of vortex hydrodynamics with non-local feedback and micro-macro-mega-entanglement in the monistic field of quantum inertia.

    "abstract": "The radical pair mechanism is an important model that may provide a basis for biological magnetoreception. To account for the high orientation precision of the real avian compass, P. J. Hore et al. proposed an intriguing phenomenon called quantum needle [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 113, 4634 (2016)], where a spike-like feature emerges in the fractional yield signal. However, it is believed that quantum needle requires the radical pair lifetime to be longer than a few microseconds and thus poses stern challenges in realistic biological systems. Here, we exploit the optimization techniques and find a novel class of model system, which sustains much more prominent features of quantum needle and significantly relaxes the requirement for radical pair lifetime. Even more surprisingly, we find that the characteristics of quantum needle retain a narrow functional window around the geomagnetic field, which is absent in the previous model systems. Therefore, our work provides essential evidence for identifying the possible physical mechanism for quantum needle in chemical magnetoreception. ",

We demonstrate the destruction free measurement of return currents at the example of a tape target system irradiated by the 1 PW VEGA3 laser at CLPU at its maximum capabilities for laser-driven ion acceleration.

    "abstract": "Microwave sensors integrated with microfluidic platforms can provide the size and permittivity of single cells and microparticles. Amongst the microwave sensor topologies, the planar arrangement of electrodes is a popular choice owing to the ease of fabrication. Unfortunately, planar electrodes generate a non-uniform electric field which causes the responsivity of the sensor to depend on the vertical position of a microparticle in the microfluidic channel. To overcome this problem, we fabricated three-dimensional (3D) electrodes at the coplanar sensing region of an underlying microwave resonator. The 3D electrodes are based on SU8 polymer which is then metallized by sputter coating. With this system, we readily characterized a mixture composed of 12 um and 20 um polystyrene particles and demonstrated separation without any position-related calibration. The ratio of the electronic response of the two particle types is approximately equal to the ratio of the particle volumes, which indicates the generation of a uniform electric field at the sensing region. The current work obviates the need for using multiple coplanar electrodes and extensive processing of the data for the calibration of particle height in a microfluidic channel: as such, it enables the fabrication of more sophisticated microwave resonators for environmental and biological applications.

An agreement between our prediction and the theoretical deduction with an accuracy of over 99.26\\% is found, showing the validity of the proposed MRNN. A time-segment polynomial fitting multiplied by a unit step function results in a loss rate of the order of $10^{-5}$, showing a striking consistence with analytical formulations for the photosynthetic EET.

Halide perovskites are particularly suitable in this respect owing to their tunable bandgap. Main drawbacks in the development of transparent perovskite solar cells are the high Voc deficit and the difficulties in depositing thin films over large area substrates, given the low solubility of bromide and chloride precursors. In this work, we develop a 2D and passivation strategies for the high band-gap Br perovskite able to reduce charge recombination and consequently improving the open-circuit voltage. We demonstrate 1cm 2 perovskite solar cells with Voc up to 1.73 V (1.83 eV QFLS) and a PCE of 8.2%. The AVT exceeds 70% by means of a bifacial light management and a record light utilization efficiency of 5.72 is achieved, setting a new standard for transparent photovoltaics. Moreover, we show the high ceiling of our technology towards IoT application due to a bifaciality factor of 87% along with 17% PCE under indoor lighting. Finally, the up-scaling has been demonstrated fabricating 20cm 2 -active area modules with PCE of 7.3% and Voc per cell up to 1.65V. ",

    "abstract": "A viable strategy for enhancing photovoltaic performance in a double quantum dot (DQD) photocell is to comprehend the underlying quantum physical regime of charge transfer. This work explores the photovoltaic performance dependent spatially correlated fluctuation in a DQD photocell. A suggested DQD photocell model was used to examine the effects of spatially correlated variation on charge transfer and output photovoltaic efficiency. The charge transfer process and the process of reaching peak solar efficiency were both significantly delayed as a result of the spatially correlated fluctuation, and the anti-spatial correlation fluctuation also resulted in lower output photovoltaic efficiency. Further results revealed that some structural parameters, such as gap difference and tunneling coefficient within two dots, could suppress the delayed response, and a natural adjustment feature was demonstrated on the delayed response in this DQD photocell model. Subsequent investigation verified that the delayed response was caused by the spatial correlation fluctuation, which slowed the generative process of noise-induced coherence, which had previously been proven to improve quantum photovoltaic performance in quantum photocells. While anti-spatial correlation fluctuation and a hotter thermal ambient environment could diminish the condition for noise-induced coherence, as demonstrated by the reduced photovoltaic capabilities in this suggested DQD photocell model. As a result, we expect that regulated noise-induced coherence, via spatially correlated fluctuation, will have a major impact on photovoltaic qualities in a DQD photocell system. The discovery of its underlying physical regime of quantum fluctuation will broaden and deepen understanding of quantum features of electron transfer, as well as provide some indications concerning quantum techniques for high efficiency DQD solar cells.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by these biological counterparts, have emerged as powerful tools for deciphering intricate data patterns and making predictions. However, conventional ANNs can be viewed as \"point estimates\" that do not capture the uncertainty of prediction, which is an inherently probabilistic process. In contrast, treating an ANN as a probabilistic model derived via Bayesian inference poses significant challenges for conventional deterministic computing architectures. Here, we use chaotic light in combination with incoherent photonic data processing to enable high-speed probabilistic computation and uncertainty quantification. Since both the chaotic light source and the photonic crossbar support multiple independent computational wavelength channels, we sample from the output distributions in parallel at a sampling rate of 70.4 GS/s, limited only by the electronic interface. We exploit the photonic probabilistic architecture to simultaneously perform image classification and uncertainty prediction via a Bayesian neural network. Our prototype demonstrates the seamless cointegration of a physical entropy source and a computational architecture that enables ultrafast probabilistic computation by parallel sampling. ",

This may present an issue for microsecond time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy experiments, in which vitreous ice samples are briefly flash melted with a laser pulse, since transient crystallization could potentially alter the dynamics of the embedded proteins. Here, we demonstrate how shaped microsecond laser pulses can be used to increase the heating rate and outrun crystallization during flash melting of amorphous solid water (ASW) samples. We use time-resolved electron diffraction experiments to determine that the critical heating rate is about $10^8$ K/s, more than two orders of magnitude higher than the critical cooling rate. Our experiments add to the toolbox of the emerging field of microsecond time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy by demonstrating a straightforward approach for avoiding crystallization during laser melting and for achieving significantly higher heating rates, which paves the way for nanosecond time-resolved experiments.

This paper focuses on the impact of levitating lunar dust particle above the lunar surface on energy harvesting through a Free Space Optics (FSO) beam, commonly known as \"laser power beaming\". This study employs known mathematical models and numerical analysis to examine a ground-to-ground link on the lunar surface, using realistic data from the literature. More precisely, it assesses transmission losses and the performance of FSO energy harvesting in the presence of lunar dust under both illuminated and dark lighting conditions. The findings reveal that the choices regarding the height above the lunar surface and the transmission distance are key determinants in evaluating both losses and energy harvesting efficiency. Specifically, it was observed that the transmit power required to operate a 250W Polaris rover at a distance of 20km was on the order of several kilowatts. Additionally, it was noted that in the Moon's darker regions, the impact of lunar dust on transmission was nearly negligible, making these areas more conducive for FSO-based energy transmission. ",

The standard (targeted) DBR structures have periodic square wave like refractive-index profiles, and their optical performance is determined by the refractive index ratio of the two applied materials and the number of DBR periods. It is well known that its structural disorder strongly affects its optical properties, but, despite that, this influence has not been quantitatively addressed in the literature. We propose a precise quantitative definition for a structural disorder of a single DBR unit cell (disorder factor), completing the set of DBR fundamental parameters. Then we expose the basis for the effective refractive index approximation (ERIA), showing that, as long as DBR optical properties are concerned, the influence of increasing structural disorder is virtually identical to the influence of decreasing refractive index ratio, with the latter influence being easily quantified. Making use of the ERIA method, simple analytical formulas, which enable rapid insights into the reflectivity and stop band width of DBRs with different types of transient layers at the heterointerfaces, are derived and the results validated, via both transfer matrix simulations and direct experimental measurements of imperfect DBRs. The insights of the ERIA method are then further applied on resonant microcavitities, providing a comprehensive link between their structural disorder and subsequent deterioration of their quality (Q) factor.

    "title": "Exploring the impact of the inverse Faraday effect on all-optical  helicity-dependent magnetization switching",
    "abstract": "All-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching (AO-HDS) is the quickest deterministic technique for data storage by solely using ultrashort laser pulses. Granular high data density magnetic storage media developed for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) provide an ideal playground to investigate the interplay of effects leading to magnetization switching. In the latest perception, we identify two effects, the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), as the forces driving the switching process. During photon absorption, which leads to a rapid temperature rise and thus to magnetization quenching, the MCD ensures two distinct electron temperatures due to helicity-dependent absorption. This effect already holds a nonvanishing probability for magnetization switching. At the same time, the IFE induces a magnetic moment within the material, enhancing the switching probability. We present AO-HDS experiments using ultrashort laser pulses ($\\lesssim 200\\,\\mathrm{fs}$) in the near-infrared range from $800\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to $1500\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The experiments demonstrate a strong dependence of the switching efficiency on the absorbed energy density, elevating the electron temperature in the vicinity of the Curie point, allowing for the IFE to take full effect, inducing a magnetic moment for deterministic switching in the quenched magnetization state. While we do not observe an enhanced switching due to an increased MCD, a higher induced magnetization usually improves the switching rate if the electron temperature reaches the transition temperature vicinity. Therefore, we conclude that the magnetic moment generated by the IFE is crucial for the switching efficiency and the distinct deterministic character of the switching process. Laser pulses with a higher absorption induce a higher magnetic moment and switch magnetization at lower fluences. ",

    "title": "Highly controllable stabilization and switching of multiple colliding  soliton sequences with generic Ginzburg-Landau gain-loss",
    "abstract": "We investigate propagation of J soliton sequences in a nonlinear optical waveguide array with generic weak Ginzburg-Landau (GL) gain-loss and nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. The propagation is described by a system of J perturbed coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equations. The NN interaction property leads to the elimination of collisional three-pulse interaction effects, which prevented the observation of stable multisequence soliton propagation with J>2 sequences in the presence of generic GL gain-loss in all previous studies. We show that the dynamics of soliton amplitudes can be described by a generalized J-dimensional Lotka-Volterra (LV) model. Stability and bifurcation analysis for the equilibrium points of the LV model, which is augmented by an application of the Lyapunov function method, is used to develop setups that lead to robust and scalable transmission stabilization and switching for a general J value. The predictions of the LV model are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations with the perturbed coupled-NLS model with J=3, 4, and 5 soliton sequences. Furthermore, soliton stability and the agreement between the LV model's predictions and the simulations are independent of J. Therefore, our study provides the first demonstration of robust control of multiple colliding sequences of NLS solitons in the presence of generic weak GL gain-loss with an arbitrary number of sequences. Due to the robustness and scalability of the results, they can have important applications in stabilization and switching of broadband soliton-based optical waveguide transmission. ",

    "abstract": "Experimental implementations of quantum simulation must balance the controllability of the quantum system under test with decoherence typically introduced through interaction with external control fields. The ratio of coherent interaction strength to decoherence induced by stimulated emission in atomic systems is typically determined by hardware constraints, limiting the flexibility needed to explore different operating regimes. Here, we present an optomechanical system for in-situ tuning of the coherent spin-motion and spin-spin interaction strength in two-dimensional ion crystals confined in a Penning trap. The system introduces active optical positioners into the tightly constrained space of the bore of a superconducting magnet, allowing adjustability of the key hardware parameter which determines the ratio of coherent to incoherent light-matter interaction for fixed optical power. Using precision closed-loop piezo-actuated positioners, the system permits in-situ tuning of the angle-of-incidence of laser beams incident on the ion crystal up to $\\theta_{\\text{ODF}}\\approx 28^\\circ$. We characterize the system using measurements of the induced mean-field spin precession under the application of an optical dipole force in ion crystals cooled below the Doppler limit through electromagnetically induced transparency cooling. These experiments show approximately a $\\times2$ variation in the ratio of the coherent to incoherent interaction strength with changing $\\theta_{\\text{ODF}}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. We characterize system stability over 6000 seconds; rigid mounting of optomechanics to the ion trap structure reduces differential laser movements to approximately $2\\times 10^{-3}$ degrees per hour, enabling long-duration experiments. These technical developments will be crucial in future quantum simulations and sensing applications. ",

    "abstract": "Optical processors hold great potential to accelerate deep learning tasks with their high clock-rates and low-loss data transmission. However, existing integrated systems are hindered by low scalability due to the quadratic scaling of device counts, energy costs with high-speed analog-to-digital converters, and lack of inline nonlinearity. Here, we overcome these challenges with a wavelength-space-time multiplexed optical tensor processor. Hyperdimensional parallelism allows matrix-matrix multiplications ($N^{3}$ operations) using $O(N)$ devices. We incorporated wavelength-multiplexed III/V-based micron-scale lasers (spanning ~1 THz) for input activation with inline rectifier (ReLU) nonlinearities and thin-film Lithium-Niobate electro-optic modulators ($V_{\\pi}\\approx1.3 V$) for dynamic weighting. With each device encoding 10-billion activations per second, we demonstrated a machine-learning model with 405,000 parameters. High-clock-rate (10 GS/s), low-energy (500 fJ/OP) parallel computing with real-time programmability unlocks the full potential of light for next-generation scalable AI accelerators. ",

Signal photons are generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a fiber cavity comprising a birefringent fiber with dichroic reflective end facets. The detection of the partner herald photon indicates the creation of the stored signal photon. After a delay, the signal photon is switched out of resonance with the fiber cavity by intracavity frequency translation using Bragg scattering four-wave mixing, driven by ancillary control pulses. We measure sub-Poissonian statistics in the output signal mode, with $g^{(2)}_{AC}=0.54(1)$ in the first readout bin and a readout frequency translation efficiency of $\\approx$80%. The 1/e memory lifetime is $\\approx$67 cavity cycles, or 1.68$\\mu$s. In an alternate fiber cavity, we show a strategy for noise reduction and measure $g^{(2)}_{AC}=0.068(10)$ after one cavity cycle. ",
