    "abstract": "Photonics offers unique capabilities for quantum information processing (QIP) such as room-temperature operation, the scalability of nanophotonics, and access to ultrabroad bandwidths and consequently ultrafast operation. Ultrashort-pulse sources of quantum states in nanophotonics are an important building block for achieving scalable ultrafast QIP, however, their demonstrations so far have been sparse. Here, we demonstrate a femtosecond biphoton source in dispersion-engineered periodically poled lithium niobate nanophotonics. We measure 17 THz of bandwidth for the source centered at 2.09 \\textmu m, corresponding to a few optical cycles, with a brightness of 8.8 GHz/mW. Our results open new paths towards realization of ultrafast nanophotonic QIP. ",

    "abstract": "This work presents, for the first time, a generalized bimode Fosters equivalent circuit for characterization of 2-D Planar Periodic Structures (PPSs) with arbitrary geometry at oblique incidence. It considers the interactions between the fundamental TE and TM modes without any restriction within the bimode bandwidth of the geometry. The proposed circuit is only composed of frequency-independent LC elements, which can be extracted systematically from electromagnetic (EM) simulations. The reactive immittances obtained in the process fulfill the Fosters theorem, enabling the design process of PPS-based devices using standardized synthesis techniques from circuit theory. To demonstrate its viability and general nature, equivalent circuits are extracted for different single- and multilayer PPS composed of rotated dipoles under oblique incidence theta=20 deg,phi=30 deg, and including dielectrics. Excellent agreement is found between the response of the circuit model and the EM simulation in all cases. Finally, to validate experimentally the proposed equivalent circuit and highlight its applicability, a 90 deg reflective LinearPolarization (LP) Rotator centered at 25 GHz and under oblique incidence, theta=30 deg, phi=0 deg (TE), is designed, manufactured, and tested. The agreement between the circuit response, the EM simulation and the measurement underlines the potential of the new equivalent circuit for PPS design under oblique incidence. ",

    "abstract": "A new approach to designing FSS-based LP-CP converters is presented. It is based on the use of FSSs which exhibit dual diagonal symmetry, and a novel 4-port equivalent circuit able to describe the electrical behavior of the cells for the two linear incident polarizations at the same time. The equivalent circuit allows the use of standardized branch line coupler theory to design LP-CP converters comprising a cascade of an arbitrary number of layers, whose synthesis includes the phase and makes it possible to achieve prescribed electrical conditions systematically. A full design procedure has been developed using the new approach and several designs in both transmission and reflection modes are presented and evaluated. It has been proven that single layer reflective converters exhibit large bandwidths as the two reflected field components are in quadrature independently of the frequency. One of these devices was designed and showed an AR<0.2 dB within the band from 21.5 to 28.5 GHz. The reflective LP-CP converter designed was also manufactured and tested, and the measurements were used to validate the design procedure. ",

For inviscid flows, we establish that resonance between neutral, smooth waves is conservative, and the temporal evolution of wave amplitudes is either bounded or explosively unstable based on the signs of the triad's interaction coefficients. Assessing the onset of weakly nonlinear instabilities through the pseudoenergy criterion introduced by Cairns (1979, J.

Additionally, extending our investigation to specific vortices, such as the Lamb-Oseen vortex and the Batchelor vortex, we find that triadic resonance among their neutral modes consistently results in bounded behaviour.

Hot and cold compressions were useful to separate the effects of pressure and the compression temperature. In-situ micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to follow the structural evolution during the thermal relaxation. A similar glass structure between the non-densified silica and the recovered densified silica after the temperature annealing demonstrates a perfect recovery of the non-densified silica glass structure. While the density decreases monotonically, the structural relaxation takes place through a more complex mechanism, which shows that density is not a sufficient parameter to fully characterize the structure of densified silica glass. The relaxation takes place through a transitory state, consisting in an increase of the network inhomogeneity, shown by an increase in intensity of the D2 band which is associated with 3 membered rings. The activation energy of these processes is 255$\\pm$45 kJ/mol for the hot compressed samples. The kinetic is overall faster for the cold compressed samples. In that last case the relaxation is partially activated by internal stresses release. ",

The TAO experiment is a notable example that utilizes a spherical scintillator barrel with a diameter of 1.8 meters, housing approximately 130,000 SiPMs organized into 4,100 tiles. Each tile with size of 5x5cm^2 consists of a 32-SiPM array functioning as a single detector unit. To achieve an unparalleled energy resolution of 2% at 1 MeV within this volume, the SiPMs must possess cutting-edge parameters, including a photon detection efficiency (PDE) exceeding 50%, cross-talk of approximately 10%, and an extremely low dark count rate (DCR) below 50Hz/mm^2. Maintaining the setup at a negative temperature of -50C is necessary to achieve the desired DCR.

Polydimethylsiloxane elastomer freestanding films, loaded homogeneously with 2% wt. carbon coated iron nanoparticles, were ablated by UV (248 nm), nanosecond laser pulses. The laser irradiation induces chemical and structural changes (both in micro-and nano-scale) to the surfaces of the nanocomposites rendering them superhydrophobic. The use of nanoparticles increases the UV light absorption eficiency of the nanocomposite samples, and thus facilitates the ablation process, since the number of pulses and the laser fluence required are greatly reduced compared to the bare polymer. Additionally the magnetic nanoparticles enhance significantly the super-hydrophobic and oleophilic properties of the PDMS sheets, and provide to PDMS magnetic properties making possible its actuation by a weak external magnetic field. These nanocomposite elastomers can be considered for applications requiring magnetic MEMS for the controlled separation of liquids. ",

In this article, we will critically examine the process of naturalizing ontology, i.e., confining the work of ontologists merely to the task of pointing out which entities certain theories commit themselves to. We will use non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a case study. We begin by distinguishing two roles for ontology: the first would be characterized by cataloging existing entities according to quantum mechanics; the second would be characterized by establishing more general ontological categories in which existing entities must be classified. We argue that only the first step is available for a naturalistic approach; the second step not being open for determination or anchoring in science. Finally, we also argue that metaphysics is still a step beyond ontology, not contained in either of the two tasks of ontology, being thus even farther from science. ",

    "abstract": "This work is part of a prediction challenge that invited theoretical/computational chemists to predict the photochemistry of cyclobutanone in the gas phase, excited at 200 nm by a laser pulse, and the expected signal that will be recorded during a time-resolved megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction (MeV-UED). We present here our theoretical predictions based on a combination of trajectory surface hopping with XMS-CASPT2 (for the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics) and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) with MP2 (for the athermal ground-state dynamics following internal conversion), coined (NA+BO)MD. The initial conditions were sampled from BOMD coupled to a quantum thermostat. Our simulations indicate that the main photoproducts after 2 ps of dynamics are CO + cyclopropane (50%), CO + propene (10%), and ethene and ketene (34%). The photoexcited cyclobutanone in its second excited electronic state S$_2$ can follow two pathways for its nonradiative decay: (i) a ring-opening in S$_2$ and a subsequent rapid decay to the ground electronic state, where the photoproducts are formed, or (ii) a transfer through a closed-ring conical intersection to S$_1$, where cyclobutanone ring opens and then funnels to the ground state. Lifetimes for the photoproduct and electronic populations were determined. We calculated a stationary MeV-UED signal [difference pair distribution function - $\\Delta$PDF$(r)$] for each (interpolated) pathway as well as a time-resolved signal [$\\Delta$PDF$(r,t)$ and $\\Delta I/I(s,t)$] for the full swarm of (NA+BO)MD trajectories. Furthermore, our analysis provides time-independent basis functions that can be used to fit the time-dependent experimental UED signals and potentially recover the population of photoproducts. We also offer a detailed analysis of the limitations of our model and their potential impact on the predicted experimental signals. ",

This innovation not only positions STEs as a pivotal advancement in THz source technology but also underscores their role as a cost-effective, high-performance solution, thereby redefining standards within the field. However, the inherent spintronic nature of these devices introduces a challenge: a lower optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency, which positions them at a notable disadvantage relative to other sources. In response, this work aims to substantially improve the electromagnetic efficiency of these emitters. This is accomplished by maximizing the energy conversion from the pumping laser for spin-electron generation. Our design integrates STEs with an optimized 1D trapping cavity, specifically engineered to fulfill critical aspects of ultrafast excitation and THz extraction. As a result, we have realized a 245% enhancement in emission and an increase of 8dB in overall intensity, positions our results among the most substantial improvements documented in this field. Furthermore, we delineate the optimal geometry for the deployment of STEs and explore the strategic selection of substrates in depth. Such enhanced emitters advance spintronic emitters towards broader applications in time-domain spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and nonlinear THz-pump spectroscopy. Enhancing spintronic emitter efficiency, combined with rapid magnetic field modulation, indicates the potential for dynamic ranges that rival traditional sources. Our predictions of STE's efficiencies, made through an electromagnetic approach, highlight its capability to uncover overlooked aspects from an optical standpoint, leading to subsequent improvements.

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the prediction of the vibration frequency response of handheld probes. A novel approach that involves machine learning and readily available data from probes was explored. Vibration probes are efficient and affordable devices that provide information about testing airborne sound insulation in building acoustics. However, fixing a probe to a vibrating surface downshifts sensor resonances and underestimates levels. Therefore, the calibration response of the sensor included in a probe differs from the frequency response of that same probe. Simulation techniques of complex mechanical systems may describe this issue, but they include hardly obtainable parameters, ultimately restricting the model. Thus, this study discusses an alternative method, which comprises different parts. Firstly, the vibration frequency responses of 85 probes were measured and labelled according to six features. Then, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Artificial Neural Networks algorithms were analysed. It was revealed that decision tree regression is the more appropriate technique for this data. The best decision tree models, in terms of scores and model structure, were fine-tuned. Eventually, the final suggested model employs only four out of the six original features. A trade-off solution that involved a simple structure, an interpretable model and accurate predictions was accomplished. It showed a maximum average deviation from test measurements ranging from 0.6 dB in low-frequency to 3 dB in high-frequency while remaining at a low computational load. This research developed an original and reliable prediction tool that provides the vibration frequency response of handheld probes. ",

    "abstract": "Tunable couplers in superconducting quantum computers have enabled fast and accurate two-qubit gates, with reported high fidelities over 0.99 in various architectures and gate implementation schemes. However, there are few tunable couplers whose performance in multi-qubit systems is clarified, except for the most widely used one: single-transmon coupler (STC). Achieving similar accuracy to isolated two-qubit systems remains challenging due to various undesirable couplings but is necessary for scalability. In this work, we numerically analyze a system of three fixed-frequency qubits coupled via two double-transmon couplers (DTCs) where nearest-neighbor qubits are highly detuned and also next nearest-neighbor ones are nearly resonant. The DTC is a recently proposed tunable coupler, which consists of two fixed-frequency transmons coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction. We find that the DTC can not only reduce undesired residual couplings sufficiently, as well as in isolated two-qubits systems, but also enables implementations of 30-ns CZ gates and 10-ns $\\pi/2$ pulses with fidelities of 0.9999 or higher. For comparison, we also investigate the system where the DTCs are replaced by the STCs. The results show that the DTC outperforms the STC in terms of both residual coupling suppression and gate accuracy in the above systems. From these results, we expect that the DTC architecture is promising for realizing high-performance, scalable superconducting quantum computers. ",

Diamond, as a host to atom-like defects with optically-accessible spin qubits, is a leading platform to realize quantum memory nodes needed to extend the reach of quantum links. Photonic crystal (PhC) cavities enhance light-matter interaction and are essential ingredients of an efficient interface between spins and photons that are used to store and communicate quantum information respectively. Despite great effort, however, the realization of visible PhC cavities with high quality factor (Q) and design flexibility is challenging in diamond. Here, we demonstrate one- and two-dimensional PhC cavities fabricated in recently developed thin-film diamonds, featuring Q-factors of 1.8x10$^5$ and 1.6x10$^5$, respectively, the highest Qs for visible PhC cavities realized in any material. Importantly, our fabrication process is simple and high-yield, based on conventional planar fabrication techniques, in contrast to previous approaches that rely on complex undercut methods. We also demonstrate fiber-coupled 1D PhC cavities with high photon extraction efficiency, and optical coupling between a single SiV center and such a cavity at 4K achieving a Purcell factor of 13. The demonstrated diamond thin-film photonic platform will improve the performance and scalability of quantum nodes and expand the range of quantum technologies. ",
