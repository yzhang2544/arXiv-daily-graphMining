    "abstract": "Exceptional points (EPs) refer to degeneracies in non-Hermitian systems where two or more eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, there has been growing interest in harnessing EPs to enhance the responsivity of sensors. Significant improvements in the sensitivity of sensors in optics and electronics have been developed. In this work, we present a novel ultrasensitive surface acoustic wave (SAW) gas sensor based on EP. We demonstrate its ability to significantly respond to trace amount of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas by tuning additional loss to approach the EP, thereby enhancing the responsivity compared to the conventional delay line gas sensors. In addition to high sensitivity, our sensor is robust to temperature variation and exclusive to H2S gas. We propose an innovative method for designing a new generation of ultrasensitive gas sensor.

The analysis employed the Multifractal Detrended Moving Average Analysis (MFDMA) method to characterize the multi-scale behavior using various geometrical parameters of the multifractal spectrum. The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: firstly, our research suggests that seismic sequences along the Ring of Fire exhibit distinct dynamics; and secondly, it indicates that long-range correlations may influence larger magnitude earthquakes, as demonstrated by the correlation with the $b_{\\rm GR}$ index. These results contribute to an enhanced understanding of the multifractal characteristics of seismic activity and their implications for earthquake dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "Large-scale and high-dimensional permutation operations are important for various applications in e.g., telecommunications and encryption. Here, we demonstrate the use of all-optical diffractive computing to execute a set of high-dimensional permutation operations between an input and output field-of-view through layer rotations in a diffractive optical network. In this reconfigurable multiplexed material designed by deep learning, every diffractive layer has four orientations: 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. Each unique combination of these rotatable layers represents a distinct rotation state of the diffractive design tailored for a specific permutation operation. Therefore, a K-layer rotatable diffractive material is capable of all-optically performing up to 4^K independent permutation operations. The original input information can be decrypted by applying the specific inverse permutation matrix to output patterns, while applying other inverse operations will lead to loss of information. We demonstrated the feasibility of this reconfigurable multiplexed diffractive design by approximating 256 randomly selected permutation matrices using K=4 rotatable diffractive layers. We also experimentally validated this reconfigurable diffractive network using terahertz radiation and 3D-printed diffractive layers, providing a decent match to our numerical results. The presented rotation-multiplexed diffractive processor design is particularly useful due to its mechanical reconfigurability, offering multifunctional representation through a single fabrication process.

However, the main challenge of integrated Brillouin devices is how to effectively confine both optical and acoustic waves. Apart from that, the manufacturing processes for these devices need to be compatible with standard fabrication platforms, and streamlined to facilitate their large-scale integration. Here, we demonstrate a novel suspended nanowire structure that can tightly confine photons and phonons. Furthermore, tailored for this structure, we introduce a loading-effect-based three-dimensional microfabrication technique, compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This innovative technique allows for the fabrication of the entire structure using a single-step lithography exposure, significantly streamlining the fabrication process. Leveraging this structure and fabrication scheme, we have achieved a Brillouin gain coefficient of 1100 1/W/m on the silicon-on-insulator platform within a compact footprint. It can support a Brillouin net gain over 4.1 dB with modest pump powers.

    "abstract": "Acoustic holographic lenses (AHLs) show great potential for sound manipulation. These lenses store the phase and amplitude profile of the desired wavefront when illuminated by a single acoustic source to reconstruct focused ultrasound (FUS) pressure fields, induce localized heating, and achieve temporal and spatial thermal effects in acousto-thermal materials like polymers. The ultrasonic energy is transmitted and focused by AHL from a transducer into a particular focal volume. It is then converted to heat by internal friction in the polymer chains, causing the temperature of the polymer to rise at the focus locations while having little to no effect elsewhere. This one-of-a-kind capability is made possible by the development of AHLs to make use of the translation of attenuated pressure fields into programmable heat patterns. However, the acousto-thermal dynamics of AHLs are largely unexplored. We use a machine learning-assisted single inverse problem approach for rapid and efficient AHL designs. The process involves the conversion of thermal information into a holographic representation through the utilization of two latent functions; pressure phase and amplitude. Experimental verification is performed for pressure and thermal measurements. The volumetric acousto-thermal analysis of experimental samples is performed to offer knowledge of the obtained pattern dynamics, as well as the applicability of holographic FUS thermal mapping for precise temperature control in complex volumes of heterogeneous media. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for anticipating and assessing thermal changes within materials using only outer surface measurements since it can correlate with surface temperature data alone.

Conventionally, chiral light can be obtained from intricate optical systems, by an external magnetic field, or by metamaterials, which necessitate sophisticated optical configurations.

    "abstract": "A conventional refractive lens surface can act as a positive (converging) or negative (diverging) lens, but the same surface cannot act as both. We show that a geometric phase metasurface lens can have the unique property of acting both as a positive or negative lens upon transmission through its front or rear side, respectively. This offers certain freedom in compound lens design, where one combines focusing and defocusing operations. We utilize this property to make an ultra-compact, varifocal reflective lens, where a metasurface is placed in front of a novel long-stroke piezoelectric MEMS-micromirror. A large theoretical diopter tunability of 6330 m$^{-1}$ is enabled due to innovative thin-film piezoelectric MEMS design, offering 62 $\\mu$m displacement at 40V and low power, along with rapid actuation in the kHz region. The achieved MEMS-displacement is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported out-of-plane mechanical metasurface actuation. Since both metasurface and micromirror are flat, the presented reflective lens can be assembled without need for a spacer. It is therefore well suited for wafer-level silicon fabrication at high volumes and low cost. A proof-of-concept implementation using a 1550nm NIR metalens is demonstrated, attaining on the order of 1121 m$^{-1}$ diopter change for a focal length shift of 270 $\\mu$m caused by a 53 $\\mu$m micromirror displacement.

Multem 3 is equipped with LAPACK, the state-of-the art Faddeeva complex error function routine, and the Bessel function package AMOS. The amendments significantly improve both the speed, convergence, and precision of Multem 2. Increased stability allows to freely increase the cut-off value LMAX on the number of spherical vector wave functions and the cut-off value RMAX controlling the maximal length of reciprocal vectors taken into consideration. An immediate bonus is that Multem 3 can be reliably used to describe bound states in the continuum (BICs). To ensure convergence of the layer coupling scheme, it appears that appreciably larger values of convergence paramaters LMAX and RMAX are required than those reported in numerous published work in the past using Multem 2. We hope that Multem 3 will become a reliable and fast alternative to generic commercial software, such as COMSOL Multiphysics, CST Microwave Studio, or Ansys HFSS, and that it will become the code of choice for various optimization tasks for a large number of research groups. The improvements concern the core part of Multem 2, which is common to the extensions of Multem 2 for acoustic and elastic multiple scattering and to the original layer-Kohn-Korringa-Rostocker (LKKR) code.

The quantum wells support two exciton modes, which simultaneously couple to an optical cavity mode via a linear coupling, and the cavity mode also couples to a mechanical vibration mode via a dispersive optomechanical interaction, accounting for both the radiation pressure and the photoelastic effect. We show that by strongly driving the microcavity with a red-detuned laser field and when the two exciton modes are respectively resonant with the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands scattered by the mechanical motion, stationary entanglement between the two exciton modes can be established under currently available parameters.

Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based surrogate model that solves dissipative quantum dynamics by parameterizing quantum propagators as Fourier neural operators, which we train using both dataset and physics-informed loss functions. Compared with conventional algorithms, our quantum neural propagator avoids time-consuming iterations and provides a universal super-operator that can be used to evolve any initial quantum state for arbitrarily long times.
