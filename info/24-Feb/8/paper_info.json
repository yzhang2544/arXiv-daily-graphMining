    "title": "Inverse Designed WS2 Planar Chiral Metasurface with Geometric Phase",
    "abstract": "Increasing attention is being paid to chiral metasurfaces due to their ability to selectively manipulate right-hand circularly polarized light or left-hand circularly polarized light. The thin nature of metasurfaces, however, poses a challenge in creating a device with effective phase modulation. Plasmonic chiral metasurfaces have attempted to address this issue by increasing light-matter interaction, but they suffer from metallic loss. Dielectric metasurfaces made from high index materials enable phase modulation while being thin. Very few materials, however, have high refractive index and low loss at visible wavelengths. Recently, some 2D materials have been shown to exhibit high refractive index and low loss in the visible wavelengths, positioning them as promising platform for meta-optics. This study introduces and details a planar chiral metasurface with geometric phase composed of WS2 meta-units. By employing adjoint optimization techniques, we achieved broadband circular dichroism.

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic showers developing from the collision of an ultra-intense laser pulse with a beam of high-energy electrons or photons are investigated under conditions relevant to future experiments on multi-petawatt laser facilities. A semi-analytical model is derived that predicts the shower multiplicity, i.e. the number of pairs produced per incident seed particle (electron or gamma photon). The model is benchmarked against particle-in-cell simulations and shown to be accurate over a wide range of seed particle energies (100 MeV - 40 GeV), laser relativistic field strengths ($10 < a_0 < 1000$), and quantum parameter $\\chi_0$ (ranging from 1 to 40). It is shown that, for experiments expected in the next decade, only the first generations of pairs contribute to the shower while multiplicities larger than unity are predicted. Guidelines for forthcoming experiments are discussed considering laser facilities such as Apollon and ELI Beamlines. The difference between electron- and photon seeding and the influence of the laser pulse duration are investigated. ",

As the bias voltage being changed, the refraction index can be tunable to negative with the simultaneous negative permittivity and permeability. While the varying pulsed laser is applied to the double QDs system, moreover, the negative refractive index with little loss can be obtained. The flexible manipulation on a solid state system to realize negative refraction may give a new way for experimental research in the future. ",

The sensor consists of a short segment of asymmetric multicore fiber (MCF) fusion spliced to a standard single mode fiber.

By monitoring simultaneously wavelength shift and light power variations, the amplitude and bend direction of the MCF can be unmistakably measured in any orientation, from 0{\\deg} to 360{\\deg}.

    "abstract": "A narrow-bandwidth actively mode-locked laser using a Cr:ZnS gain medium has been successfully demonstrated. A free-space electro-optic phase modulator is employed in the solid-state laser resonator to achieve frequency-modulation (FM) mode-locking, which achieves a narrow spectral width of ~1 GHz and a pulse duration of ~500 ps over a wide tuning range of 1947-2445 nm. The operation frequency of the modulator determines the repetition rate of the mode-locked pulse train and can stabilize it to millihertz-level without any additional feedback loop systems. We also study the theoretical expression of pulse duration and spectral width in a FM mode-locking in a laser cavity that contains considerable group-delay dispersion. The results indicates that larger intracavity dispersion can only stabilize the laser operation by avoiding mode switching, but also narrow the spectral width and increase the pulse duration. The proposed laser features a narrow spectral width at a desired mid-infrared wavelength and a comb-like spectral structure with stabilized longitudinal mode spacing, providing a powerful tool for sensing and control of molecules.

    "abstract": "The possibility of making compact stopband filters using coplanar-coupled EBG resonators in inverted microstrip gap waveguide technology is studied in this work. To do this, the filtering characteristics of different configurations of mushroom-type elements are shown in which the short-circuit element is placed on the edge of the resonator of the patch. The behavior of the structure as well as its main advantages such as: low losses, self-packaging, low level of complexity, flexibility and easy design are illustrated in the paper. To evaluate the possibility of integrating these structures in gap waveguide planar antennas feeding networks, a 5-cell EBG filter was designed and built at the X band. The proposed filter reached a maximum rejection level of minus 35.4 dB, had a stopband centered at 9 GHz and a relative fractional bandwidth below minus 20 dB of 10.6 percent. The new compact filter presented a flat passband in which it was well matched and had low insertion losses that, including the connectors, were close to 1.5 dB in most of the band. These results are enough to improve low-complexity future antenna designs with filter functionalities in this technology. ",

By decreasing atomic density with coherent delocalization, we suppress cold-collision shifts and two-body losses. Atom loss attributed to Landau-Zener tunneling in the ground lattice band would compromise coherent delocalization at low trap depths for our \\textsuperscript{171}Yb atoms; hence, we implement for the first time delocalization in excited lattice bands. Doing so increases the spatial distribution of atoms trapped in the vertically-oriented optical lattice by $\\sim7$ times. At the same time we observe a reduction of the cold-collision shift by 6.5(8) times, while also making inelastic two-body loss negligible. With these advantages, we measure the trap-light-induced quenching rate and natural lifetime of the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state as $5.7(7)\\times10^{-4}$ $E_r$\\textsuperscript{$-1$}s\\textsuperscript{$-1$} and 19(2) s, respectively.

One way to prevent the decay is to place the vortex at the centre of a convergent (draining) fluid flow, which tends to force vortices together. It is found that whilst the primary splitting instability is suppressed in this way (and completely quenched for strong enough flows) a secondary instability can emerge in circular trapping geometries. This behaviour is related to an instability of rotating black holes when superradiantly amplified waves are confined inside a reflective cavity. The end state of the secondary instability is dramatic, manifesting as a shock wave that propagates round the circular wall and nucleates many more vortices. ",

However, preparation times increase with system size and constitute a severe bottleneck in the bottom-up assembly of large ordered arrays from stochastically loaded optical traps. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to circumvent this bottleneck by recycling atoms from one experimental run to the next, while continuously reloading and adding atoms to the array. Using this approach, we achieve densely-packed arrays with more than 1000 atoms stored in an optical lattice, continuously refilled with a net 2.5 seconds cycle time and about 130 atoms reloaded during each cycle. Furthermore, we show that we can continuously maintain such large arrays by simply reloading atoms that are lost from one cycle to the next. Our approach paves the way towards quantum science with large ordered atomic arrays containing thousands of atoms in continuous operation. ",
