    "abstract": "Low-frequency (LF) wireless communications play a crucial role in ensuring anti-interference, long-range, and efficient communication across various environments. However, in conventional LF communication systems, their antenna size is required to be inversely proportional to the wavelength, so that their mobility and flexibility are greatly limited. Here we introduce a novel prototype of LF receiving antennas based on optically levitated nanoparticles, which overcomes the size-frequency limitation to reduce the antenna size to the hundred-nanometer scale. These charged particles are extremely sensitive to external electric field as mechanical resonators, and their resonant frequencies are adjustable. The effectiveness of these antennas was experimentally demonstrated by using the frequency shift keying (2FSK) modulation scheme. The experimental results indicate a correlation between error rate and factors such as transmission rate, signal strength, and vacuum degree with a signal strength of approximately 0.1V/m and a bit error rate below 0.1%. This advancement in leveraging levitated particle mechanical resonators (LPMRs) as LF antennas marks a significant stride in long-distance communication technology. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce quantum spatio-temporal dynamics (QSD) as modeled by the Nexus Paradigm (NP) of quantum gravity to resolve the problem of energy-momentum localization in a gravitational field. Currently, the gravitational field as described using the language of geometry modeled under General Relativity (GR) fails to provide a generally accepted definition of energy-momentum. Attempts at resolving this problem using geometric methods have resulted in various energy-momentum complexes whose physical meaning remain dubious since the resulting complexes are non-tensorial under a general coordinate transformation. In QSD, the tangential manifold is the affine connection field in which energy-momentum localization is readily defined. We also discover that the positive mass condition is a natural consequence of quantization and that dark energy is a Higgs like field with negative energy density everywhere. Finally, energy-momentum localization in quantum gravity shows that a free falling object will experience larger vacuum fluctuations (uncertainties in location) in strong gravity than in weak gravity and that the amplitudes of these oscillations define the energy of the free falling object.

With the recent advances in non-Hermitian topological physics, topological Anderson insulators have been generalized to systems with non-Hermitian disorder. However, achieving disorder-induced nontrivial point-gap topology, which is unique to non-Hermitian systems and is responsible for non-Hermitian skin effect, remains elusive. In this work, we experimentally realized non-Hermitian disorder-induced point-gap topology in a one-dimensional acoustic crystal. By controlling the gain factor of the amplifier in each basic unit, we obtained a series of disordered unidirectional hoppings with tunable strength. Using disordered acoustic crystals under open boundary conditions, we observed the emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect and the direction reversal of skin mode localization when the disorder strength is tuned. These results serve as hallmarks of point-gap topological phase transition induced by non-Hermitian disorder. Our work paves the way for exploring various disorder-induced phenomena in non-Hermitian acoustic systems. ",

A one-dimensional (1D) computer model is developed using the Puffin, un-averaged FEL simulation code, which allows sub-radiation wavelength evolution of both the spike radiation field and the electron dynamics to be modelled until the highly non-linear saturation process of the spike is observed. Animations of the process from the start to the end of the interaction are available. The resultant saturated spike duration is at the sub-wavelength scale and has a broad spectrum. The electrons passing through the spike can both lose and gain energy many times greater than that of the normal non-pulsed FEL interaction. A saturation mechanism is proposed and tested via a simple analysis of the 1D FEL equations. The scaling results of the analysis are seen to be in good agreement with the numerical results. A simple model of three dimensional diffraction effects of the radiation is applied to the results of the 1D simulations. This greatly reduces longer wavelengths of the power spectrum, which are seen to be emitted mainly after the electrons have propagated through the spike, and is seen to be in qualitative agreement with recent experimental results.

This is similar to the notion of molecular hybridization, but one of the components is light. Here, we utilized the idea and prepared quantum phototransistors using donor-acceptor combinations that can transfer energy via Rabi oscillations. As a prototype experiment, we used a cyanine J-aggregate (TDBC; donor) and MoS2 monolayer (acceptor) in a field effect transistor cavity and studied the photoresponsivity. The energy migrates through the newly formed polaritonic ladder, and the relative efficiency of the device is nearly seven-fold at the ON resonance. Further, the photon mixing fraction is calculated for each independent device and correlated with energy transfer efficiency. In the strongly coupled system, newly formed polaritonic states reshuffle the probability function. A theoretical model based on the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation is also used to interpret the results. Here, the entangled light-matter states act as a strong channel for funnelling the energy to the MoS2 monolayer, thereby boosting its ability to show the highest photoresponsivity at ON-resonance.

This review discusses various applications of graphene in THz technology, including sensing, spectroscopy, photonics, and communications. First, the basic physics and techniques of THz-wave absorption processes in graphene are discussed. THz wave absorption in graphene can occur both through interband and intraband absorption processes. Such absorption can be readily modulated by an applied gate voltage and can be enhanced by utilizing parallel-plate waveguides or a total internal reflection geometry. Next, the effect of adsorbed molecules on THz emission from graphene is described. This phenomenon can be used to construct a metamaterial-free THz sensor for biointerfaces. The manipulation of THz waves through thermal annealing is also discussed, as well as their enhancement in a graphene-based THz modulator employing metallic ring apertures. Lastly, the review highlights the excitation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons in graphene at THz frequencies, which can play important roles in THz devices for communications, nanophotonics, and imaging.

These models typically involve a few parameters that are estimated via fitting the experimental data to provide a qualitative understanding of the underlying physics. Such a few-parameters fitting approach falls short of accurately capturing all elements of the complex-valued permittivity tensor across a range of wavelengths. Accurate characterization of the permittivity tensor elements across a broad range of wavelengths is invariably imperative for designing optical elements such as isolators, circulators, etc. Here, we propose and demonstrate a ubiquitous and accessible method based on a combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectroscopic Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements coupled with rigorous numerical parameter extraction techniques. To this end, we use the combined MOKE ellipsometry measurements conducted at different angles of incidence with a gradient-descent minimization algorithm to provide the inverse solution to the complete dielectric permittivity tensor. Further, we demonstrate model re-verification to ensure the estimated dielectric permittivity values reliably predict the measured experimental data. Our method is a simplified bench-top counterpart to the otherwise complex measurement systems. ",

While the former can routinely reach octave-spanning bandwidths and the latter feature microwave-rate spacings, achieving both in the same material platform has been challenging. Here, we leverage both strong Kerr nonlinearity and efficient electro-optic phase modulation available in the ultralow-loss thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, to demonstrate a hybrid Kerr-electro-optic frequency comb with stabilized spacing. In our approach, a dissipative Kerr soliton is first generated, and then electro-optic division is used to realize a frequency comb with 2,589 comb lines spaced by 29.308 GHz and spanning 75.9 THz (588 nm) end-to-end. Further, we demonstrate electronic stabilization and control of the soliton spacing, naturally facilitated by our approach. The broadband, microwave-rate comb in this work overcomes the spacing-span tradeoff that exists in all integrated frequency comb sources, and paves the way towards chip-scale solutions for complex tasks such as laser spectroscopy covering multiple bands, micro- and millimeter-wave generation, and massively parallel optical communications.

Recently, rapid developments in integrated optical reference cavities and microresonator-based optical frequency combs (microcombs) have created a path to transform OFD technology to chip scale. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-low phase noise mmWave oscillator by leveraging integrated photonic components and Kerr optical frequency division. The oscillator derives its stability from an integrated CMOS-compatible SiN coil cavity, and the optical frequency division is achieved spontaneously through Kerr interaction between the injected reference lasers and soliton microcombs in the integrated SiN microresonator. Besides achieving record-low phase noise for integrated mmWave oscillators, our demonstration greatly simplifies the implementation of integrated OFD oscillators and could be useful in applications of Radar, spectroscopy, and astronomy.

We synthesize these light states with predefined spatial and chromatic dynamics through applying a sequence of transformations to shape the optical field in all its dimensions. Similar methods can also be used to overcome dispersion processes in other physical settings like acoustics and electron optics.

Low-pressure helium exchange gas at 5 K might contribute to the challenging task.

Inherent shortcomings in each platform push exploration of hybrid and heterogeneous integration, which demands specialized designs and extra fabrication processes for each material combination. Our work introduces a novel hybrid integration scheme employing a 3D-nanoprinted interposer for a photonic chiplet interconnection system. This method represents a generic solution that can readily couple between chips of any material system, with each fabricated on its own technology platform with no change in the established process flow for the individual chips. Mode-size engineering is enhanced by the off-chip parabolic micro-reflectors. The 3D-nanoprinted chip-coupling frame and fiber-guiding funnel enable low-loss, fully passive assembly with a fast-printing process achieving sub-micron accuracy. Mode-field-dimension conversion ratio of 5:2 from fiber to chip is demonstrated with <0.5dB excess loss on top of the 1.7dB inherent coupling loss, marking the largest mode size conversion using non-waveguided components. Additionally, our system demonstrates a 2.5dB die-to-die coupling loss between silicon and InP chips over a 140nm wavelength range (1480nm to 1620nm), showcasing the potential for extensive cross-platform integration by bridging different waveguide materials.

This concept provides isolated electron pulses and merges the spatial resolution of a transmission electron microscope with the temporal resolution that is offered by a single cycle of laser light. Central to these achievements is a perforated parallel-plate metallic waveguide in which transverse velocity mismatch and magnetic forces are mitigated by electrically constructive and magnetically destructive interferences of incoming and reflected terahertz half-cycles from a displaced waveguide termination. Measurements of spatial chirp via energy-filtered imaging reveal flat pulses with no transversal deflection or temporal aberrations at the specimen. We also report the all-optical control of multi-electron states and discover a substantial two-electron and three-electron anti-correlation in the time domain. These results open up the possibility to visualize atomic and electronic motions together with their quantum correlations on fundamental dimensions in space and time. ",

The leaky resonant mode can be directly excited by weak linearly polarized normally incident optical field. In the presence of Kerr nonlinearity, the BIC can be indirectly excited by an optical bistable response. Two types of bistable operations are considered. For the first type, the intensity of the incident field gradually increases to exceed a critical value, and then decreases to zero. For the second type, the intensity is fixed, while the linear polarization angle of the incident field gradually increases to exceed a critical value, and then decreases to 0$^{o}$. Theoretically, the indirectly excited BIC can store the optical energy without loss, even though the intensity of the incident field decreases to zero. Incidence of an optical field with double frequency or orthogonal linear polarization can erase the stored optical field by destroying the BIC. The proposed optical system could function as optical storage and switching device. ",

Also, the multi-layer P3F stack promises smaller footprints and better nonlinearity than single-layer counterparts, thanks to the higher capacitance density and lower thermal resistance.

They are sensitive to individual photons in the optical wavelength regime and achieve time resolutions of a few tens of picoseconds, which makes them interesting candidates for timing detectors in tracking systems for particle physics experiments. The Geiger discharges triggered in the sensitive elements of a SiPM, Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), yield signal amplitudes independent of the energy deposited by a photon or ionizing particle. This intrinsically digital nature of the signal motivates its digitization already on SPAD level. A digital SiPM (dSiPM) was designed at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), combining a SPAD array with embedded CMOS circuitry for on-chip signal processing. A key feature of the DESY dSiPM is its capability to provide hit-position information on pixel level, and one hit time stamp per quadrant at a 3 MHz readout-frame rate. The pixels comprise four SPADs and have a pitch of about 70 um. The four time stamps are provided by 12 bit Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) with a resolution better than 100 ps. The chip was characterized in the laboratory to determine dark count rate, breakdown voltage, and TDC characteristics. Test-beam measurements are analyzed to assess the DESY dSiPMs performance in the context of a 4D-tracking applications.

As such, we can detect the error in the logical state with minimized readout-induced noise. By adopting our method as a pre-check routine for quantum error correcting cycles, we can significantly reduce the readout overhead, the idling time, and the logical error rate during syndrome measurement. We numerically analyze the performance of our protocol using Iceberg code and Steane code under realistic noise parameters based on superconducting hardware and demonstrate the advantage of our protocol in the near-term scenario.

However, such architectures, due to their traditional realization based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material platform, face two shortcomings. First, the high-index contrast of the SOI platform incurs high scattering losses, which mandates the provisioning of high optical input power.Second, SOI waveguides are susceptible to two-photon absorption, which can incur substantial optical signal losses at moderate-to-high signal fan-in. These shortcomings have severely detrimental effects on the achievable parallelism, throughput, and energy efficiency of SOI MRR-based GEMM accelerators. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel Silicon Nitride (SiN)-Based Photonic GEMM Accelerator called SiNPhAR. SiNPhAR architecture employs SiN-based active and passive devices to implement analog GEMM functions. Since the SiN material exhibits lower index contrast and no TPA, the optical signal losses in our SiNPhAR architecture are very low. This advantage significantly enhances the achievable processing parallelism, throughput, and energy efficiency of SiNPhAR architecture, compared to SOI-based photonic GEMM accelerators from prior work. We quantify and compare these benefits of SiNPhAR architecture via our cross-layer evaluation for a benchmark workload comprising four modern deep neural network models. From the system-level performance analysis, SiNPhAR demonstrates at least 1.7x better throughput FPS while consuming at least 2.8x better energy efficiency (FPS/W) than prior SOI-based GEMM accelerators.

We significantly extend this analogy by introducing Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a cavity, as well as the moir\\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.

    "title": "Non-Heisenberg quantum mechanics",
    "abstract": "Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\\hat x,\\hat p]=i\\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \\to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\\Delta x \\Delta p\\geq \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promotes the polymer design paradigm from a traditional trial-and-error approach to a data-driven style. Achieving high thermal conductivity (TC) for intrinsic polymers is urgent because of their importance in the thermal management of many industrial applications such as microelectronic devices and integrated circuits. In this work, we have proposed a robust AI-assisted workflow for the inverse design of high TC polymers. By using 1144 polymers with known computational TCs, we construct a surrogate deep neural network model for TC prediction and extract a polymer-unit library with 32 sequences. Two state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms of unified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (U-NSGA-III) and q-noisy expected hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI) are employed for sequence-ordered polymer design with both high TC and synthetic possibility. For triblock polymer design, the result indicates that qNHEVI is capable of exploring a diversity of optimal polymers at the Pareto front, but the uncertainty in Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling makes the trials costly. The performance of U-NSGA-III is affected by the initial random structures and usually falls into a locally optimal solution, but it takes fewer attempts with lower costs. 20 parallel U-NSGA-III runs are conducted to design the pentablock polymers with high TC, and half of the candidates among 1921 generated polymers achieve the targets (TC > 0.4 W/(mK) and SA < 3.0). Ultimately, we check the TC of 50 promising polymers through molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the intrinsic connections between microstructures and TCs. Our developed AI-assisted inverse design approach for polymers is flexible and universal, and can be extended to the design of polymers with other target properties. ",

    "abstract": "Combining resonant excitation with Purcell-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs) stands out as a prominent strategy for realizing high performance solid-state single photon sources. However, optimizing photon efficiency requires addressing challenges associated with effectively separating the excitation laser from QDs' emission. Traditionally, this involves polarization filtering, which limits the achievable polarization directions and the scalability of photonic states. In this study, we have successfully tackled this challenge by employing spatially-orthogonal resonant excitation of QDs, deterministically coupled to monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities. Leveraging the membrane cavity structures, we have achieved filter-free single photon resonant fluorescence. The resulting source produces single photons with a simultaneous high extraction efficiency of 0.87, purity of 0.9045(4), and indistinguishability of 0.963(4). ",

Following the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics for a particle in a finite convex region, we show how the maximum values of the wavefunction's amplitude lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum potential, implying a classical flow velocity of the particle. The effect is obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian structures. We further show that such an effect cannot be achieved in the relativistic regime when dealing with quantum particles in flat or curved spacetime. ",

By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, we explore the conditions under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. Our theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.

At fields up to 200 mT we can observe a broad absorption peak that shifts to higher frequencies with magnetic field according to ferromagnetic resonance theory. The amplitude of absorption, up to 85%, together with the frequency width of about 4.5 GHz makes this material suitable as wave absorber.

    "abstract": "High-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-$Q_m$ mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with $Q_m$ up to $2.9\\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained 290 nm-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a $Q_m \\times f_m$-product approaching $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN. ",

In this theoretical study, we investigate the influence of laser focusing, radiation reaction and a broad bremsstrahlung $\\gamma$ spectrum on the energy and angular distributions of created pairs. Understanding the role of these inherent reaction attributes provides relevant insights for experimental detection strategies and data interpretation. We show that the inclusion of radiation reaction leads to a narrow energy spectrum of the yielded particles, whose maximum is shifted to substantially lower energies as compared to the case in which radiative energy losses are ignored. The broad bremsstrahlung spectrum also has distinct influence on the particle distributions, whereas the impact of laser focusing turns out to be rather moderate in the considered parameter regime.

Unlike density-functional and coupled-cluster theories applied to electron-phonon or electron-photon systems, the accuracy of our approach is not limited by the unknown exchange-correlation functional or the uncontrolled form of the exponential ansatz.
