    "abstract": "Global and national efforts to deliver high-quality nuclear data to users have a broad impact across applications such as national security, reactor operation, basic science, medical fields, and more. Cross section evaluation is a large part this effort as it combines theory and experiment to produce suggested values and uncertainty for reaction probabilities. In most isotopes, the cross section exhibits resonant behavior in what is called the resonance region of incident neutron energy. Resonance region evaluation is a specialized type of nuclear data evaluation that can require significant, manual effort and months of time from expert scientists. In this article, non-convex, non-linear optimization methods are combined with concepts of inferential statistics to infer a set of optimized resonance models from experimental data in an automated manner that is not dependent on prior evaluation(s). This methodology aims to enhance the workflow of a resonance evaluator by minimizing time, effort, and prior biases while improving reproducibility and document-ability, addressing widely recognized challenges in the field.

    "abstract": "The emergence of a flat band in Dirac-Weyl materials offers new possibilities for electronic transitions, leading to stronger interaction with light. As a result, the optical conductivity can be significantly enhanced in these flat-band materials as compared with graphene, making them potentially better candidates for optical sensing and modulation. Recently, a comprehensive theory for the optical conductivity of a spectrum of flat-band Dirac-Weyl materials has been developed, with explicit formulas for both the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity derived through two independent approaches. This Perspective offers a review of the development. An understanding of the optical properties of the flat-band Dirac-Weyl materials paves the way for optical device applications in the terahertz-frequency domain. ",

    "abstract": "In experimental physics, it is essential to understand electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering across EM spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, and is pivotal in driving photonics innovations. Recent advancements have uncovered phenomena like bound states in the continuum (BICs) and parity-time (PT) symmetric systems, which are closely associated with the characteristics of the scattering matrix and are governed by passivity and causality. The emergence of complex frequency excitations has transcended the constraints imposed by passivity and causality in a system, revealing effects such as virtual critical coupling and virtual gain. However, applying the concepts of complex frequency excitation in more complicated systems remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the extension of the lumped element model of circuit theory to the analysis of anomalies in light scattering in the complex frequency domain. We demonstrate that the circuit model approach can facilitate design and analysis of effects such as virtual perfect absorption, BICs, real and virtual critical coupling, exceptional points, and anisotropic transmission resonances (ATRs). These findings broaden comprehension of EM wave phenomena and pave the way for significant advancements in photonics, offering new methods for designing and optimizing optical devices and systems with broad-ranging applications.

    "title": "Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy  toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity",
    "abstract": "Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. ",

    "abstract": "Managing insertion losses, polarizations and device footprint is crucial in developing large-scale photonic integrated circuits (PICs). This paper presents a solution to these critical challenges by designing a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) in the O-band with reduced polarization sensitivity, leveraging the ultra-compact InP Membrane on Silicon (IMOS) platform. The platform is compatible with close integration atop electronics, via densely populated vertical interconnects. The SOA incorporates a thin tensile-strained bulk active layer to mitigate polarization sensitivity. The developed 500 um long SOA has a peak gain of 11.5 dB at 1350 nm and an optimal polarization dependency of less than 1 dB across a 25 nm bandwidth, ranging from 1312 nm to 1337 nm. The device is practical for integrated circuits where multiple amplifiers work in cascades with a minimal 6.5 dB noise figure (NF) measured at the gain peak. The designed vertical active-passive transition, achieved through inverse tapering, allows for effective field coupling in the vertical direction resulting in a transmission efficiency of over 95% at the transition and minimal polarization sensitivity of less than 3%. The device yields significant gain at a small current density of less than 3 kA/cm2 as the result of minimalist gain medium structure, reducing joule heating and improving energy efficiency. This is especially relevant in applications such as optical switching, where multiple SOAs populate the PIC within a small area. Consequently, the simulated and fabricated low polarization sensitive O-band SOA is a suitable candidate for integration into large-scale, ultra-compact photonic integrated circuits. ",

    "abstract": "The fabrication and integration of high-quality structures of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) is critical for magnonics.Films with excellent properties are obtained only on single crystal Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG) substrates using high-temperature processes. The subsequent realization of magnonic structures via lithography and etching is not straightforward as it requires a tight control of the edge roughness, to avoid magnon scattering, and planarization in case of multilayer devices. In this work we describe a different approach based on local laser annealing of amorphous YIG films, avoiding the need for subjecting the entire sample to high thermal budgets and for physical etching. Starting from amorphous and paramagnetic YIG films grown by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature on GGG, a 405 nm laser is used for patterning arbitrary shaped ferrimagnetic structures by local crystallization. In thick films (160 nm) the laser induced surface corrugation prevents the propagation of spin-wave modes in patterned conduits. For thinner films (80 nm) coherent propagation is observed in 1.2 micron wide conduits displaying an attenuation length of 5 micron which is compatible with a damping coefficient of about 5e-3. Possible routes to achieve damping coefficients compatible with state-of-the art epitaxial YIG films are discussed. ",

The phase purity and crystalline quality of the films are assessed by evaluating the optical properties of Eu3+ ions embedded in this oxide matrix. In view of the results, we discuss the possible phase formation mechanisms, and the potential of this new wafer-compatible form of YSO for quantum technologies applications. ",

The analytical model based on the electron hydrodynamics illustrates the underlying physical mechanism of the release of electrons from the channel wall when irradiated by an intense laser, the subsequent electron dynamics, and the corresponding evolution of the channel density profile. The quantitative predictions of the total charge of released electrons and the average electron density inside the channel are validated by comparison with the simulation results. ",

Then, we employ random optical fields to sort mesoporous silica particles. Random optical fields by containing local intensity gradients throughout a wide range of field of view provide an elegant, easy-to-implement, and low-cost variant of multiple optical tweezers, which is known as speckle tweezers (ST). ST, similar to multiple optical tweezers, for manipulation tasks, such as trapping, sorting, and guiding of collection of micro and sub-micro objects in several disciplines including statistical physics, chemistry, microfluidics and material science. We show that ST can restrict, sieve, and sort MCM-41 and MCM-41GA particles. The different interaction of mesoporous silica variations with the applied ST may be attributed to the pre-applied modification and the differences in the porosity structure and distribution. Therefore, the results provide insight into the textural and chemical characteristics of mesoporous materials, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential applications. ",

Commercial spatial light modulators (SLMs) typically have megapixel-scale apertures but are limited to ~kHz operational speeds. Developing a device that controls a similar number of spatial modes at high speeds could potentially transform fields such as imaging through scattering media, quantum computing with cold atoms and ions, and high-speed machine vision, but to date remains an open challenge. In this work we introduce and demonstrate a free-form, resonant electro-optic (EO) modulator with megapixel apertures using CMOS integration. The optical layer features a Lithium Niobate (LN) thin-film integrated with a photonic crystal (PhC), yielding a guided mode resonance (GMR) with a Q-factor>1000, a field overlap coefficient ~90% and a 1.6 GHz 3-dB modulation bandwidth (detector limited). To realize a free-form and scalable SLM, we fabricate the PhC via interference lithography and develop a procedure to bond the device to a megapixel CMOS backplane. We identify limitations in existing EO materials and CMOS backplanes that must be overcome to simultaneously achieve megapixel-scale, GHz-rate operation. The `LN on Silicon' (LNoS) architecture we present is a blueprint towards realizing such devices. ",

We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under certain conditions.

Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox. ",
