    "title": "Low-loss multilevel operation using lossy PCM-integrated silicon  photonics",
    "abstract": "Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) offer new paradigms for programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) thanks to their zero static energy and significant refractive index contrast. However, prototypical PCMs, such as GeSbTe (GST), are lossy in their crystalline phase, albeit transparent in the amorphous state. Moreover, electrically switching PCMs to intermediate states is a stochastic process, limiting programming accuracy. As a result, achieving both low-loss and deterministic multi-level operation with GST remains challenging. Although low-loss PCMs, such as Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, have been discovered in recent years, they are much less technologically mature. In this work, we propose a design with multiple GST segments to overcome the challenge of deterministic multilevel operation. GST segments are individually controlled by interleaved silicon PIN diode heaters in a binary but reliable fashion, and multiple levels are encoded in their phase sequence. A 1 x 1 programmable unit with two unequal GST segments is experimentally demonstrated, showcasing four distinct operation levels and negligible thermal crosstalk with only one pair of metal contacts. We then extend the design to 1 x 2 and 2 x 2 programmable units. For the 2 x 2 programmable unit design, we propose a phase-detuned three-waveguide directional coupler structure to mitigate the absorption and radiation loss, showing < -1.2 dB loss and three splitting ratios. Our work provides a new path toward low-loss and multi-level optical switches using lossy PCMs. ",

    "abstract": "Molecular orbital theory is powerful both as a conceptual tool for understanding chemical bonding, and as a theoretical framework for ab initio quantum chemistry. Despite its undoubted success, MO theory has well documented shortcomings, most notably that it fails to correctly describe diradical states and homolytic bond fission. In this contribution, we introduce a generalised MO theory that includes spin-coupled radical states. We show through archetypical examples that when bonds break, the electronic state transitions between a small number of valence configurations, characterised by occupation of both delocalised molecular orbitals and spin-coupled localised orbitals. Our theory provides a model for chemical bonding that is both chemically intuitive and qualitatively accurate when combined with ab initio theory. Although exploitation of our theory presents significant challenges for classical computing, the predictable structure of spin-coupled states is ideally suited to algorithms that exploit quantum computers. Our approach provides a systematic route to overcoming the initial state overlap problem and unlocking the potential of quantum computational chemistry. ",

    "abstract": "The comparison of optical reference frequency signals over free-space optical links is limited by the relative motion between local and remote sites. Extreme Doppler shifts experienced in rapidly moving optical links, such as for ground-to-space, prevent the narrow-band detection required to compare or transfer optical frequencies at the highest levels of stability. We demonstrate a system capable of optical frequency comparison in the presence of extreme Doppler shifts, using an electro-optic phase modulator with an actuation bandwidth of 10 GHz, sufficient to enable ground-to-space frequency comparison. This system was demonstrated over a retro-reflected drone link, with a maximum line-of-sight velocity of 15 m/s and Doppler shift of 20 MHz. The best fractional frequency stability obtained was 2E-17 at an integration time of 2 s. These results suggest that optical frequency comparison between rapidly moving targets, as in ground-to-space applications, is possible with further system development. ",

    "abstract": "Subwavelength gratings play a fundamental and pivotal role in numerous science and applications for wave manipulation, exhibiting distinctive features such as filtering, phase manipulation, and anti-reflection. However, conventional fabrication methods for ultrasmall periodic structures are constrained by the fundamental optical diffraction limit, making it challenging to produce subwavelength gratings for optics. Here, we demonstrate a novel technique to build a reconfigurable subwavelength photorefractive grating (SPG) in a thin-film lithium niobate on the platform of an optical microcavity. Such SPGs are optically induced through the photorefractive effect and the subwavelength features originate from the spatial phase modulations of the pump's standing wave. The resulting SPGs lead to the mode splitting of two counter-propagating modes inside the microcavity, exhibiting an Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT)-like transmission spectrum. Moreover, the unique subwavelength characteristic of SPGs enables first-order quasi-phase-matching for backward second-harmonic generation, a long-standing problem in nonlinear optics. Also, free-space-to-chip vertical nonlinear frequency conversion can be achieved in a similar manner. These results provide a flexible approach towards fabricating subwavelength gratings, which holds significant potential in various applications such as nonlinear frequency conversion, optical communication, sensing, and quantum technologies.

    "abstract": "Optical tweezers have revolutionized the manipulation of nanoscale objects, offering versatile control over trapped particles. Typically, the manipulation and trapping capabilities of optical tweezers rely on adjusting either the trapping laser beams or the optical environment surrounding the trapped nanoparticles. In our study, we present a novel approach to achieve tunable and switchable trapping using optical tweezers. We utilize nanoparticles made of a phase-change material (vanadium dioxide or VO$_2$), trapped by a focused Gaussian beam. By varying the intensity of the trapping beam, we can optically control the phase and optomechanical properties of the vanadium dioxide nanoparticles. At lower intensities, the nanoparticle remains in its monoclinic phase, and it is trapped by attractive optical forces. However, at higher intensities, the optical beam induces a phase transition in the nanoparticle to the rutile phase, which dramatically alters the optical forces, transforming them from attractive to repulsive, thereby pushing the nanoparticle away from the beam. Importantly, this effect is reversible, allowing the same particle to be attracted and repelled repeatedly. The observed phenomenon is governed by Mie resonances supported by the nanoparticle and their alterations during the phase transition of the VO$_2$ material. Our findings introduce a versatile new addition to the optical tweezers toolbox for optomechanical manipulation of nanoparticles. ",

This paper proposes an approach to extending the functionality of a standard magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by introducing an additional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (FM/AFM) storage layer (SL) vertically integrated with the standard Vortex MTJ stack into the nanopillar. The magnetostatic field created by this storage layer acts on the free layer and can be used to change its static and dynamic properties. To tune the magnitude and direction of this magnetostatic field, magnetic reconfiguration is carried out through a thermally assisted switching mechanism using a voltage pulse that heats the AFM layer in the SL above the Neel temperature in the presence of an external field. It is experimentally shown that using an MTJ based on a 600 nm diameter nanopillar with a vortex in the free layer, reconfiguration of the SL allows to continuously change the core precession frequency in the 15 MHz range. The reconfigurable analogue storage layer locally affects both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ free layer, demonstrating vertical 3D integration of additional functionalities into a single MTJ nanopillar.

A scenario with a known analytical solution. Our findings indicate that solving the deconvolution inverse problem with a fully connected NN yields less performing results than those obtained using the GPs derived from NN's asymptotic limits. Furthermore, we observe the trained NN's accuracy approaching that of GPs with increasing layer width.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art computational methods combined with common idealized structural models provide an incomplete understanding of experiments on real nanostructures, since manufacturing introduces unavoidable deviations from the design. We propose to close this knowledge gap by using the real structure of a manufactured crystal as input in computations to obtain a realistic comparison with observations on the same nanostructure. We demonstrate this approach on the structure of a real silicon inverse woodpile photonic bandgap crystal, obtained by previous synchrotron X-ray imaging. A 2D part of the dataset is selected and processed into a computational mesh suitable for a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) to compute optical transmission spectra that are compared to those of a utopian crystal, i.e., a hypothetical model crystal with the same filling fraction where all pores are identical and circular. The nanopore shapes in the real crystal differ in a complex way from utopian pores, leading to a complex transmission spectrum with significant frequency speckle in and beyond the gap. The utopian model provides only a limited understanding of the spectrum: while it accurately predicts low frequency finite-size fringes and the lower band edge, the upper band edge is off, it completely misses the presence of speckle, the domination of speckle above the gap, and possible Anderson localized states in the gap. Moreover, unlike experiments where only external probes are available, numerical methods allow to study all fields everywhere. While the pore shapes hardly affect the fields at low frequency, major differences occur at high frequency such as localized fields deep inside the real crystal. In summary, using only external measurements and utopian models may give an erroneous picture of the fields and the LDOS inside a real crystal, which is remedied by our new approach. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing has shown promise for finding solutions to difficult optimization problems, including protein folding. Recently, we used the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer to explore the folding problem in a coarse-grained lattice model, the HP model, in which amino acids are classified into two broad groups: hydrophobic (H) and polar (P). Using a set of 22 HP sequences with up to 64 amino acids, we demonstrated the fast and consistent identification of the correct HP model ground states using the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical solver. An equally relevant biophysical challenge, called the protein design problem, is the inverse of the above, where the task is to predict protein sequences that fold to a given structure. Here, we approach the design problem by a two-step procedure, implemented and executed on a D-Wave machine. In the first step, we perform a pure sequence-space search by varying the type of amino acid at each sequence position, and seek sequences which minimize the HP-model energy of the target structure. After mapping this task onto an Ising spin glass representation, we employ a hybrid quantum-classical solver to deliver energy-optimal sequences for structures with 30-64 amino acids, with a 100% success rate. In the second step, we filter the optimized sequences from the first step according to their ability to fold to the intended structure. In addition, we try solving the sequence optimization problem using only the QPU, which confines us to sizes $\\le$20, due to exponentially decreasing success rates. To shed light on the pure QPU results, we investigate the effects of control errors caused by an imperfect implementation of the intended Hamiltonian on the QPU, by numerically analyzing the Schr\\\"odinger equation. We find that the simulated success rates in the presence of control noise semi-quantitatively reproduce the modest pure QPU results for larger chains. ",

While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime. ",

Here, we analyse both the linear and nonlinear regimes using the lattice Green function formalism that is particularly suitable for the case of polariton arrays described in a tight-binding approximation.
