The $\\varepsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$ are evaluated in a quantized composite right-left handed transmission line (CRLH-TL), and the frequency band for left-handedness is also valuated in the balanced resonance ($ L_r C_l = L_l C_r $) and unbalanced resonance($L_l C_r \\neq L_r C_l$) cases in the displaced squeezed Fock state. The results show that the balanced resonance plays an important role in bandwidth and achieving for left-handedness.

Additional slow temporal modulation of the pump source stabilizes the spatio-temporal solution in a broad range of parameters, which are defined by the dynamic gain saturation. We choose a Cr:ZnS waveguide laser as a practical example, but such a regime is feasible in various waveguide and fiber oscillators. A far-reaching analogy with Bose-Einstein condensates allows using this approach to stabilization of the weakly dissipative BECs. ",

    "abstract": "Measurement science now connects strongly with engineering of quantum coherence, many-body states, and entanglement. To scale up the performance of an atomic clock using a degenerate Fermi gas loaded in a three-dimensional optical lattice, we must understand complex many-body Hamiltonians to ensure meaningful gains for metrological applications. In this work, we use a near unity filled Sr 3D lattice to study the effect of a tunable Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The clock laser introduces a spin-orbit coupling spiral phase and breaks the isotropy of superexchange interactions, changing the Heisenberg spin model into one exhibiting XXZ-type spin anisotropy. By tuning the lattice confinement and applying imaging spectroscopy we map out favorable atomic coherence regimes. With weak transverse confinement, both s- and p-wave interactions contribute to decoherence and atom loss, and their contributions can be balanced. At deep transverse confinement, we directly observe coherent superexchange interactions, tunable via on-site interaction and site-to-site energy shift, on the clock Ramsey fringe contrast over timescales of multiple seconds. This study provides a groundwork for using a 3D optical lattice clock to probe quantum magnetism and spin entanglement ",

    "abstract": "The huge gap between the public perception of science and the reality of scientific research severely limits the scope of public engagement with science. We create and develop new theatre, film and games work and related artistic endeavors inspired by science and technology. In this paper, we describe the Quantum Games Project, one of the most recent artistic endeavors in our lab. This project consists of a series of card and digital games and an immersive experience, all of which expose the public to quantum physics without learning barriers. Quantum physics explains the counter-intuitive and surprising ways matter behaves at the subatomic level. It is an exciting and growing field that offers solutions to new technological problems. However, learning quantum physics requires several prerequisites, such as a foundation in the sciences and mathematics, and is primarily taught at the undergraduate and higher levels. As a result, the concepts may be too elusive and abstract for the general public to learn independently. This difficulty is compounded by the limited availability of easily understandable resources and teaching materials that do not employ scientific jargon and equations. Our work attempts to solve this problem by communicating the concepts of quantum physics in a way that is comprehensible and accessible to the general public. This paper provides a general overview of the development of the Quantum Games Project, focusing specifically on the Quantum Photo Booth experience, and describes how science is integrated into the very nature of the game development process and its outcome.

    "abstract": "On-chip optical neural networks (ONNs) have recently emerged as an attractive hardware accelerator for deep learning applications, characterized by high computing density, low latency, and compact size. As these networks rely heavily on massive matrix multiplication, photonic computing cores for matrix computation become crucial components for on-chip ONNs, which harness the degree of freedoms (DOFs) in photonics including space, wavelength and mode dimensions. However, previous photonic computing devices have not fully utilized the orthogonality and the conversion characteristic of the waveguide modes, which as we show here, allows for the simultaneous parallel computing of several independent matrix-vector multiplications within the same device. In this work, we propose an inverse-designed photonic computing core for parallel matrix-vector multiplication. The matrices are implemented through a mode conversion process, where the input fundamental modes are simultaneously converted into several orthogonal output modes. Specifically, we target the complex-valued conversion matrices between input and output modes and inversely design the dielectric distribution within the device to achieve parallel matrix-vector multiplication. As a demonstration, the proposed photonic computing core supports simultaneous parallel computing of two independent matrix-vector multiplications, with an ultra-compact footprint and high computing precision (relative error < 8%) at 1550 nm wavelength. The inverse-designed photonic computing devices hold great potential for high-performance on-chip ONNs with low energy consumption and high computing density. ",

    "abstract": "To overcome the physical limitations of electrically small antennas, strain-mediated magnetoelectric antennas have been studied experimentally and theoretically. However, current closed-form analytical models include solely one-dimensional approaches. This paper proposes a two-dimensional closed-form analytical model of a laterally-excited multiferroic antenna. To model thickness-shear vibrations, we propose an extended Mason model to two dimensions. This theory solves unidirectionally-coupled elastodynamics-magnetization dynamics-electrodynamics. Without using the infinitesimal dipole approximation, this model provides a closed-form solution of the radiated electromagnetic field with an explicit dependency of the antenna response on the physical parameters, enabling their optimization. Furthermore, we compare the efficiency-bandwidth product of different multiferroic antennas with Chu's limit in the Akhiezer regime, which delimits the highest achievable mechanical quality factor for acoustic resonators at GHz frequencies. We show that phonon-phonon coupling of Akhiezer damping is most likely to limit multiferroic antenna radiation, not Chu's limit. Moreover, judicious choice of materials can enhance the maximum efficiency by more than an order of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "Emitters based on photoconductive materials excited by ultrafast lasers are well established and popular devices for THz generation. However, so far, these emitters, both photoconductive antennas and large area emitters, were mostly explored using driving lasers with moderate average powers (either fiber lasers with up to hundreds of milliwatts or Ti:Sapphire systems up to few watts). In this paper, we explore the use of high power, MHz repetition rate Ytterbium (Yb) based oscillator for THz emission using a microstructured large area photoconductive emitter, consist of semi insulating GaAs with a 10 by 10 mm2 active area. As a driving source, we use a frequency doubled home built high average power ultrafast Yb oscillator, delivering 22 W of average power, 115 fs pulses with 91 MHz repetition rate at a central wavelength of 516 nm. When applying 9 W of average power (after an optical chopper with a duty cycle of 50 percent) on the structure without optimized heatsinking, we obtain 65 uW THz average power, 4 THz bandwidth; furthermore, we safely apply up to 18 W of power on the structure without observing damage. We investigate the impact of excitation power, bias voltage, optical fluence, and their interplay on the emitter performance and explore in detail the sources of thermal load originating from electrical and optical power. Optical power is found to have a more critical impact on LAE saturation than electrical power, thus optimized heatsinking will allow us to improve the conversion efficiency in the near future towards much higher emitter power. This work paves the way towards achieving hundreds of MHz or even GHz repetition rates, high power THz sources based on photoconductive emitters, that are of great interest for example for future THz imaging applications.

Antenna on waveguide is first designed by scaling radio frequency dimensions to nano-optics, taking into account the hybrid plasmonic/photonic platform. Design is then optimized by full numerical simulations. We fabricate the antenna on a TiO$_2$ planar waveguide and deposit a few QDs close to the Yagi-Uda antenna.
