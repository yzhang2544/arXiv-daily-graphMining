    "abstract": "We discuss terahertz pump-probe experiments in hBN from the perspective of Floquet optical materials and photonic time crystals. Anisotropic nature of this material results in a large separation of frequencies of in-plane and out-of-plane optical phonons and leads to several branches of phonon-polariton excitations. We consider a slab of finite thickness pumped at the frequency of middle polaritons, around 25 THz. We theoretically analyze properties of the pump induced state and identify several interesting features, including possible light amplification and parametric instability at 2 THz. We relate these features to resonant pair scattering processes of polaritons excited by the pump pulse. We show that amplification/instability frequency ranges depend on both the pump intensity and the slab thickness. We point out that this setup can be used utilized to strongly enhance optical nonlinearities at terahertz frequencies. Richness and tunability of this system suggests that it holds promise for practical applications in terahertz technology. ",

Using an one-dimensional (1D) photonic crystal (PhC) system with the anisotropic defect layer(ADL), we firstly find that the generation efficiency of the vortex beam is close to 50\\% when the number of periodic layers of the PhC reaches 5. Secondly, We also discussed the case where linearly polarized light is obliquely incident on a defect state system, and find that the destructive interference between the normal mode and the abnormal mode reaches the maximum, resulting in the enhancement of the spin hall displacement, and the effect can be enhanced at any angle of incidence in this system. Finally, we found that in the defect mode, the mutual conversion of normal and abnormal mode spins can be regulated, and the conversion efficiency can be close to 100\\%. ",

    "abstract": "A study of damage and ablation of silicon induced by two individual femtosecond laser pulses of different wavelengths, 1030 and 515 nm, is performed to address the physical mechanisms of dual-wavelength ablation and reveal possibilities for increasing the ablation efficiency. The produced ablation craters and damaged areas are analyzed as a function of time separation between the pulses and are compared with monochromatic pulses of the same total energy. Particular attention is given to low-fluence irradiation regimes when the energy densities in each pulse are below the ablation threshold and thus no shielding of the subsequent pulse by the ablation products occurs. The sequence order of pulses is demonstrated to be essential in bi-color ablation with higher material removal rates when a shorter-wavelength pulse arrives first at the surface. At long delays of 30-100 ps, the dual-wavelength ablation is found to be particularly strong with the formation of deep smooth craters. This is explained by the expansion of a hot liquid layer produced by the first pulse with a drastic decrease in the surface reflectivity at this timescale. The results provide insight into the processes of dual-wavelength laser ablation offering a better control of the energy deposition into material. ",

Here we realize a silicon-integrated four-channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical receiver based on a micro-ring resonator (MRR) array and four p-n homojunction GPDs by using mechanically exfoliated monolayer graphene. These GPDs based on the photo-thermoelectric (PTE) effect operating under zero (current) bias exhibit responsivities of ~1.1 V W^-1 and flat frequency responses up to 67 GHz which is set-up limited. The GPDs show good consistence benefiting from the compact active region array (0.006 mm^2) covered by a single hBN/graphene/hBN stack. Moreover, the WDM graphene optical receiver realized the 4x16 Gbps non-return to zero (NRZ) optical signal transmission. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GPD-array-based optical receiver using mechanically exfoliated graphene and edge graphene-metal conduct. This work shed light on the large-scale integration of GPDs by using the high-quality mechanically exfoliated graphene, promoting the application and development of the graphene photonic devices. ",

The measured phase shifts can be used to probe many types of interactions whether it be nuclear, electromagnetic, gravitational, or topological in nature. For a perfect-crystal interferometer to preserve coherence, the crystal must possess a high degree of dimensional tolerance as well as being relatively defect-free with minimal internal stresses. In the past, perfect-crystal neutron interferometers have been produced by a two step process. First, a resin diamond wheel would be used to remove excess material and shape the interferometer. Afterword, the crystal would be etched in order to remove surface defects and elevate strains. This process has had limitations in terms of repeatability and in maximizing the final contrast, or fringe visibility, of the interferometer. We have tested various fabrication and post-fabrication techniques on a single perfect-crystal neutron interferometer and measured the interferometer's performance at each step. Here we report a robust, repeatable non-etching fabrication process with high final contrast. For the interferometer used in this work, we achieved contrasts of greater than 90% several separate times and ultimately finished with an interferometer that has 92% contrast and a uniform phase distribution.

    "abstract": "Experimental insight into the elementary processes underlying charge transfer across interfaces has blossomed with the wide-spread availability of ultra-high vacuum set-ups that allow the preparation and characterization of solid surfaces with well-defined molecular adsorbates over a wide ranges of temperatures. Thick layers of molecular adsorbates or heterostructures of 2D materials generally preclude the use of electrons or atoms as probes in such characterization. However with linear photon-in/photon-out techniques it is often challenging to assign the observed optical response to a particular portion of the interface. We and prior workers have demonstrated in work under ambient conditions that by full characterization of the symmetry of the second order nonlinear optical susceptibility, i.e. the $\\chi^{(2)}$, in sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, this problem can be overcome. Here we describe an ultra-high vacuum system built to allow conventional UHV sample preparation and characterization, femtosecond and polarization resolved SFG spectroscopy, the azimuthal sample rotation necessary to fully describe $\\chi^{(2)}$ symmetry and with sufficient stability to allow scanning SFG microscopy. We demonstrate these capabilities in proof-of-principle measurements on CO adsorbed on Pt(111) and of the clean Ag(111) surface. Because this set-up allows both full characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility and the temperature control and sample preparation/characterization of conventional UHV set-ups we expect it to be of great utility in investigation of both the basic physics and applications of solid, 2D material heterostructures.

This study evaluates the impact of a precisely tuned fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM process on the energy absorption and failure characteristics of thermoplastic lattice materials through multiscale experiments and predictive modelling. Lattices with four distinct unit cell topologies and three varying relative densities are manufactured, and their in-plane mechanical response under quasi-static compression is measured. Macroscale testing and micro-CT imaging reveal relative density-dependent damage mechanisms and failure modes, prompting the development of a robust predictive modelling framework to capture process-induced performance variation and damage. For lower relative density lattices, an FE model based on the extended Drucker-Prager material model, incorporating Bridgman correction with crazing failure criteria, accurately captures the crushing response. As lattice density increases, interfacial damage along bead-bead interfaces becomes predominant, necessitating the enrichment of the model with a microscale cohesive zone model to capture interfacial debonding. All proposed models are validated, highlighting inter-bead damage as the primary factor limiting energy absorption performance in FFF-printed lattices. Finally, the predictive modelling introduces an enhancement factor, providing a straightforward approach to assess the influence of the AM process on energy absorption performance, facilitating the inverse design of FFF-printed lattices. This approach enables a critical evaluation of how FFF processes can be improved to achieve the highest attainable performance and mitigate failures in architected cellular materials. ",

The ratio of two orthogonal beams can be controlled by varying the amplification factor, and we observe different evolution trajectories of the output state of polarizations on Poincare sphere. When the amplification factor exceeds a certain threshold, the scrambler system exhibits chaotical behavior. A commercial single wavelength laser with linewidth of 3 MHz is utilized to characterize the scrambling performance. We found that when the sampling rate is 1.6 MSa/s, a scrambling speed up to 2000 krad/s can be obtained for the average degree of polarization being less than 0.1. We also exploit these chaotic polarization fluctuations to generate random binary number, indicating that the proposed technique is a good candidate for random bit generator. ",

    "abstract": "Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate 'Schr\\\"odinger cat' states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. A key challenge to improving the optimal achievable clock precision with GHZ states is their reduced dynamic range. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision. ",

    "abstract": "Combining quantum and Bayesian principles leads to optimality in metrology, but exact solutions can be hard to find. This work mitigates this problem with a novel class of exactly solvable optimisation equations. For any quantity isomorphic to a location parameter, rules to devise optimal measurements are given in closed form. These are valid for any parameter range, prior information, or state, and the associated estimators apply to finite samples. This framework unifies the metrology of locations, scales, and other parameter types such as relative weights, for which hyperbolic errors are required. But the central advantage lies on its simplifying power: searching for good strategies amounts to identifying which symmetry leaves a state of maximum ignorance invariant, irrespective of error bounds. This reduces the number of calculations needed in practice and enables the rigorous application of quantum metrology to fundamental physics, where symmetries play a key role. ",

    "title": "Magnetic resonance delta radiomics to track radiation response in lung  tumors receiving stereotactic MRI-guided radiotherapy",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has become a standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer. However, the heterogeneous response to radiation at the tumor level poses challenges. Currently, standardized dosage regimens lack adaptation based on individual patient or tumor characteristics. Thus, we explore the potential of delta radiomics from on-treatment magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to track radiation dose response, inform personalized radiotherapy dosing, and predict outcomes. Methods: A retrospective study of 47 MR-guided lung SBRT treatments for 39 patients was conducted. Radiomic features were extracted using Pyradiomics, and stability was evaluated temporally and spatially. Delta radiomics were correlated with radiation dose delivery and assessed for associations with tumor control and survival with Cox regressions. Results: Among 107 features, 49 demonstrated temporal stability, and 57 showed spatial stability. Fifteen stable and non-collinear features were analyzed. Median Skewness and surface to volume ratio decreased with radiation dose fraction delivery, while coarseness and 90th percentile values increased. Skewness had the largest relative median absolute changes (22%-45%) per fraction from baseline and was associated with locoregional failure (p=0.012) by analysis of covariance. Skewness, Elongation, and Flatness were significantly associated with local recurrence-free survival, while tumor diameter and volume were not. Conclusions: Our study establishes the feasibility and stability of delta radiomics analysis for MR-guided lung SBRT. Findings suggest that MR delta radiomics can capture short-term radiographic manifestations of intra-tumoral radiation effect. ",

    "title": "Towards Efficient Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry: Reducing  Circuit Complexity with Transcorrelated and Adaptive Ansatz Techniques",
    "abstract": "The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans\\\"atze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\\\"atze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans\\\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.

    "abstract": "Collective spins in thermal gases are at the core of a multitude of science and technology applications. In most of them, the random thermal motion of the particles is considered detrimental as it is responsible for decoherence and noise. In conditions of diffusive propagation, thermal atoms can potentially occupy various stable spatial modes in a glass cell. Extended or localized, diffusive modes have different magnetic properties, depending on the boundary conditions of the atomic cell, and can react differently to external perturbations. Here we demonstrate that few of these modes can be selectively excited, manipulated, and interrogated in atomic thermal vapours using laser light. In particular, we individuate the conditions for the generation of modes that are exceptionally resilient to undesirable effects introduced by optical pumping, such as light shifts and power-broadening, which are often the dominant sources of systematic errors in atomic magnetometers and co-magnetometers. Moreover, we show that the presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the pump, on top of the random diffusive atomic motion, introduces a coupling that leads to a coherent exchange of excitation between the two longest-lived modes. Our results indicate that systematic engineering of the multi-mode nature of diffusive gases has great potential for improving the performance of quantum technology applications based on alkali-metal thermal gases, and promote these simple experimental systems as versatile tools for quantum information applications.
