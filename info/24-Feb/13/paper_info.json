    "abstract": "Equation of state measurements at Jovian or stellar conditions are currently conducted by dynamic shock compression driven by multi-kilojoule multi-beam nanosecond-duration lasers. These experiments require precise design of the target and specific tailoring of the spatial and temporal laser profiles to reach the highest pressures. At the same time, the studies are limited by the low repetition rate of the lasers. Here, we show that by the irradiation of a thin wire with single beam Joule-class short-pulse laser, a converging cylindrical shock is generated compressing the wire material to conditions relevant for the above applications. The shockwave was observed using Phase Contrast Imaging employing a hard X-ray Free Electron Laser with unprecedented temporal and spatial sensitivity. The data collected for Cu wires is in agreement with hydrodynamic simulations of an ablative shock launched by a highly-impulsive and transient resistive heating of the wire surface. The subsequent cylindrical shockwave travels towards the wire axis and is predicted to reach a compression factor of 9 and pressures above 800 Mbar. Simulations for astrophysical relevant materials underline the potential of this compression technique as a new tool for high energy density studies at high repetition rates. ",

ISRS is a pump-probe coherent Raman spectroscopy that can capture Raman vibrational spectra. Recording of ISRS spectra requires isolation of a probe pulse from the pump pulse. While this separation is simple in non-scattering specimens, such as liquids, scattering leads to significant pump pulse contamination and prevent the extraction of a Raman spectrum. We introduce a robust method for ISRS microscopy that works in complex scattering samples. High signal-to-noise ISRS spectra are obtained even when the pump and probe pulses pass through many scattering layers. ",

    "abstract": "The non-linear and tunable optical constants of phase-change materials associated with their phase-switching have been utilized in reconfigurable optical devices. For example, one possible application of phase-change thin films is for tunable perfect absorption designs, where p- polarized light reflectance vanishes at a specific incidence angle known as the Brewster angle. This work demonstrates a generalized Brewster effect (s- and p- polarized light absorption) for a multilayered heterostructure design based on the strong interference effect. The proposed design comprises a low-loss phase-change material, Sb2Se3, coated on a gold substrate. We experimentally and theoretically show the coexistence of vanishing reflectance values for both s- and p- polarized lights in the visible and near IR wavelength range at a single Brewster angle. Such vanishing reflectance values (points of darkness) are associated with phase singularities with abrupt changes. Moreover, we show that additional phase singularities can be realized by switching the active Sb2Se3 layer between amorphous and crystalline structures, extending the functionality of our design. The realized phase singularities are susceptible to small optical constant changes and can be utilized for ultra-sensing applications. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate our design's CO2 gas sensing capabilities, showing a linearly dependent optical response with gas flow rate. We believe our lithography-free design with multiple phase singularities, from the coexisting generalized Brewster effect and from the additional structural switching, is highly promising for tunable optical sensing applications.

We use a LaAlO3 crystal doped with a small amount of Nd3+ ions for the polarized lanthanum target. Optimizing the amount of Nd3+ ions is considerably important because the achievable polarization and relaxation time strongly depend on this amount. We established a fundamental method to grow single crystals of Nd3+:LaAlO3 using an optical floating zone method that employs halogen lamps and evaluated the crystals with the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) method for polarizing nuclear spins. Two crystal samples were grown by ourselves and evaluated with the DNP at 1.3 K and 2.3 T for the first time except for the target materials of protons. The enhancement of NMR signals for 139La and 27Al was successfully observed, and the enhancement factors were eventually 3.5+-0.3 and 13+-3 for the samples with Nd3+ ions of 0.05 and 0.01 mol%, respectively. The combination scheme of the crystal growth and evaluation of the crystals is found to be effectively applicable for optimizing the amount of Nd3+ ions for improving the performance of the polarized target.

The obtained nonlinear DW equation is a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, in which the linear dispersiveness, linear growth, nonuniformity of diamagnetic drift frequency, and cubic nonlinearity induced by feedback of forced-driven ZF to DWs are self-consistently included. The nonlinear DW equation is solved numerically in both uniform and nonuniform plasmas. It is shown that DWenvelope soliton may form due to the balance of linear dispersiveness and nonlinearity, and lead to turbulence spreading to linearly stable region. It is further found that though the threshold on DW amplitude for soliton formation is well within the relevant parameter regimes of realistic tokamak experiments, solitons can not extend beyond the range bounded by the turning points of the wave packet when plasma nonuniformity is self-consistently accounted for.

    "abstract": "We observe clear precessional motion of highly birefringent liquid crystal (LC) particles trapped in a spherically aberrated optical trap which is built around a tilted refractive index stratified medium. For input circularly polarized light, the breaking of azimuthal symmetry induced by the tilt leads to an asymmetric intensity distribution in the radial direction near the trap focal plane, which - in combination with the spin-orbit conversion effects for input circularly polarized light - results in non-uniform canonical and spin momentum densities in those regions. In addition, while the canonical momentum remains always oriented towards the axial direction, the spin momentum reverses direction along spatial loops in the radial direction. As a consequence, the total momentum precesses around the canonical momentum vector along elliptical spatial loops - akin to a Larmor-like precession of magnetic moment (total momentum in our case) around a magnetic field (canonical momentum). We probe this precession experimentally using the single trapped LC particles - with the direction of precession determined by the helicity of the input light and the precession frequency varying linearly with the laser power. Our experimental results are validated by numerical simulations of the system where we employ the Debye-Wolf theory for tight focusing in the presence of a tilted stratified media. ",

    "abstract": "Dual-comb spectroscopy is a powerful technique to measure optical spectra in a wide spectral range with high-frequency resolution. The development of compact systems operating in the long-wave infrared wavelength range is of high interest for spectroscopic and sensing applications. Amongst the different techniques to obtain optical frequency-combs, electro-optic frequency-comb generation presents major advantages thanks to the tunable repetition rate only limited by the bandwidth of the used electro-optical modulator. However, the development of integrated and efficient electro-optical modulators operating in a wide long-wave infrared spectral band is still at its infancy, and electro-optical frequency-comb has not been demonstrated so far beyond the telecom band. In this work, a Schottky-based modulator embedded in a Ge-rich graded SiGe waveguide is used for electro-optic frequency-comb generation. Considering the limited efficiency of the modulator, harmonically-rich RF signals are used to enhance the generation of comb lines around the optical carrier. Interestingly, this allows us to demonstrate the generation of electro-optical combs spanning over 2.4 GHz around 8 {\\mu}m wavelength. This paves the way towards fully integrated and tunable mid-infrared electro-optic frequency-comb generation systems. ",

However, instances where the back action of the particles influences and modifies SOI effects so as to induce rotational motion are rarely known. Here, we tightly focus a vector beam having radial/azimuthal polarization carrying no intrinsic angular momentum, into a refractive index stratified medium, and observe orbital rotation of birefringent particles around the beam propagation axis. In order to validate our experimental findings, we perform numerical simulations of the underlying equations. Our simulations reveal that the interaction of light with a birefringent particle gives rise to inhomogeneous spin currents near the focus, resulting in a finite spin momentum. This spin momentum combines with the canonical momentum to finally generate an origin-dependent orbital angular momentum which is manifested in the rotation of the birefringent particles around the beam axis. Our study describes a unique modulation of the SOI of light due to interaction with anisotropic particles that can be used to identify new avenues for exotic and complex particle manipulation in optical tweezers.

    "abstract": "Volumetric modification of glass materials by ultrashort laser pulses is a powerful technique enabling direct writing of three-dimensional structures for fabrication of optical, photonic, and microfluidic devices. The level of modification is determined by the locally absorbed energy density, which depends on numerous factors. In this work, the effect of the spatial pulse shape on the ultrashort laser excitation of fused silica was investigated experimentally and theoretically for the volumetric modification regimes. We focused on two shapes of laser pulses, Gaussian and doughnut-shaped (DS) ones. It was found that, at relatively low pulse energies, in the range of 1-5 microjoules, the DS pulses are more efficient in volumetric structural changes than Gaussian pulses. It is explained by the intensity clamping effect for the Gaussian pulses, which leads to the delocalization of the laser energy absorption. In the DS case, this effect is overcome due to the geometry of the focused beam propagation, accompanied by the electron plasma formation, which scatters light toward the beam axis. The thermoelastoplastic modeling performed for the DS pulses revealed intriguing dynamics of the shock waves generated because of tubular-like energy absorption. It is anticipated that such a double shock wave structure can induce the formation of high-pressure polymorphs of transparent materials that can be used for investigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of warm dense matter. The DS laser pulses of low energies of the order of 100 nanojoules which generate a gentle tubular-like modification can be perspective for a miniature waveguide writing in glass. ",
