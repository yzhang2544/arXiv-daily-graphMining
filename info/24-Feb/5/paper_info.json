    "abstract": "In this work, we examine the extraordinary behavior of polarization and spin angular momentum (AM) density in the vicinity of longitudinal field zeros in three-dimensional monochromatic acoustic fields. We demonstrate that, as governed by the continuity equation, the velocity fields of arbitrary acoustic sources maintain non-diffractive elliptical polarization structures that enclose longitudinal field zeros, despite having divergent transverse spatial profiles of intensity. Furthermore, embedded in these nonparaxial field contours, for infinite distance, are threads of circular polarization singularities. We illuminate these inherent properties in acoustic vortex fields, dipole arrays, and the famous Young's double slit experiment. Our results reveal novel characteristics of vector sound waves that provide a platform for future studies and applications of structured acoustic waves and chiral acoustic phenomena. ",

    "abstract": "Sonic crystal acoustic screens have been in progressive research and development in the last two decades as a technical solution for mitigating traffic noise. Their behaviour is quite different from that observed in classical barriers, with the latter being based on physically blocking the direct sound propagation path (only allowing diffracted noise to reach sensible receivers), and sonic crystals providing attenuation efficiency based on the creation of band-gaps at specific frequency ranges, due to the Bragg's interference phenomenon. The distinct physical mechanisms of these two types of noise barriers complicates the use of classical simplified or even numerical models developed for traditional barriers to simulate and predict the attenuation performance of a sonic crystal, and alternative methods become thus required. In the acoustics scientific literature, several authors have proposed estimation and simulation methods based on different numerical tools to predict the sound insulation provided by these new noise abatement solutions. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of some of these methods, with emphasis to the assessment of their accuracy versus memory usage in order to determine which one is the most suitable for optimization methodologies in the design of new devices with improved acoustic performance.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally beam-dependent photonic spin-orbit coupling in a two-wave mixing process described by an equivalent of the Pauli equation in quantum mechanics. The considered structured light in the system is comprising a superposition of two orthogonal spin-orbit-coupled states defined as spin up and spin down equivalents. The spin-orbit coupling is manifested by prominent pseudo spin precession as well as spin-transport-induced orbital angular momentum generation in a photonic crystal film of wavelength thickness. The coupling effect is significantly enhanced by using a deep-subwavelength carrier envelope, different from previous studies which depend on materials. The beam-dependent coupling effect can find intriguing applications; for instance, it is used in precisely measuring variation of light with spatial resolution up to 15 nm. ",

    "abstract": "In the evolving domain of wireless communication, the investigation on terahertz (THz) frequency spectrum, spanning 0.1 to 10 THz, has become a critical focus for advancing ultra-high-speed data transmission technologies. The effective deployment of THz wireless communication techniques mandates a complete study of channel performance under various atmospheric conditions, such as rain, fog, cloud, haze, and notably, snow. These environmental elements significantly impact the design of the protocol stack, ranging from physical-layer signal processing to application design and strategic network planning. An in-depth understanding of channel propagation and fading characteristics in real-world environments, especially over ultra-wide bandwidths, is crucial. This work presents a comprehensive measurement-based and theoretical investigation of line-of-sight (LoS) THz channel performance in snowy conditions. It methodically examines both the empirical and predicted aspects of channel power and bit-error-ratio (BER). The effects of snowfall rate, carrier frequency, ambient temperature, and relative humidity on channel performance are analyzed and discussed. Our findings demonstrate that snowy conditions not only amplify power loss but also induce rapid fluctuations in the power levels of the THz channel. Notably, our results reveal an absence of significant multipath effects in these scenarios. This insight highlights the need for further research into the dynamics of snowflake movement and their interaction with THz transmission paths. ",

    "abstract": "Acousto-optic integration offers numerous applications including low-loss microwave signal processing, nonreciprocal light propagation, frequency comb generation, and broadband acousto-optic modulation. State-of-the-art acousto-optic systems are mainly implemented entirely using in-house fabrication processes, which despite excellent performance typically suffer from low yield and are not compatible with mass production through foundry processes. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient wideband acousto-optic modulator (AOM) implemented on a silicon photonics foundry process enabling high-yield low-cost mass production of AOMs with other photonic and electronic devices on the same substrate. In the reported structure, a 150 ${\\mu}$m long AlScN-based acoustic transducer launches surface acoustic waves (SAW), which modulate the light passing through a silicon optical waveguide. A modulation efficiency of -18.3 dB over a bandwidth of 112 MHz is achieved, which to our knowledge is the highest reported efficiency and bandwidth combination among silicon based AOMs, resulting in about an order of magnitude $BW(V_{\\pi}L)^{-1}$ figure-of-merit improvement compared to the state-of-the-art CMOS compatible AOMs. The monolithically integrated acousto-optic platform developed in this work will pave the way for low-cost, miniature microwave filters, true time delays, frequency combs, and other signal processors with the advanced functionality offered by foundry-integrated photonic circuits.

    "abstract": "We study analytically and numerically a frequency downshifting due to power-type frequency-dependent decay of surface waves in the ocean covered by ice floes. The downshifting is obtained both within the linear model and within the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation augmented by viscous terms for the initial condition in the form of an NLS envelope soliton. It is shown that the frequency-dependent dissipation produces a more substantial downshifting when the spectrum is relatively wide. As a result, the nonlinear adiabatic scenario of wavetrain evolution provides a downshifting remarkably smaller in magnitude than in the linear regime. Meanwhile, interactions between nonlinear wavegroups lead to spectral broadening and thus, result in fast substantial frequency downshifts. Analytic estimates are obtained for an arbitrary power $n$ of the dependence of a dissipation rate on frequency $\\sim \\omega^n$. The developed theory is validated by the numerical modelling of the generalized NLS equation with dissipative terms. Estimates of frequency downshift are given for oceanic waves of realistic parameters. ",

Here, we report on the synthesis of polycrystalline NiO fabricated using spray-pyrolysis technique, which is a deposition technique able to produce quite uniform films of pure and crystalline materials without the need of high vacuum or inert atmospheres. We then characterized the composition and structure of our NiO thin films using X-ray diffraction, and atomic force and scanning electron microscopies, respectively. We completed our study by looking at the phononic and magnonic properties of our NiO thin films via Raman spectroscopy, and at the ultrafast electron dynamics by using optical pump probe spectroscopy. We found that our NiO samples display the same phononic and magnonic dispersion expected for single crystal NiO at room temperature, and that electron dynamics in our system is similar to those of previously reported NiO mono- and poli-crystalline systems synthesized with different techniques. These results prove that spray-pyrolysis can be used as affordable and large-scale fabrication technique to synthetize strongly correlated materials for a large set of applications. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the individual impacts of critical magnetodynamical parameters-effective magnetization and magnetic damping-on the auto-oscillation characteristics of nano-constriction-based Spin Hall Nano-Oscillators (SHNOs). Our micromagnetic simulations unveil a distinctive non-monotonic relationship between current and auto-oscillation frequency in out-of-plane magnetic fields. The influence of effective magnetization on frequency tunability varies with out-of-plane field strengths. At large out-of-plane fields, the frequency tunability is predominantly governed by effective magnetization, achieving a current tunability of 1 GHz/mA-four times larger than that observed at the lowest effective magnetization. Conversely, at low out-of-plane fields, although a remarkably high-frequency tunability of 4 GHz/mA is observed, the effective magnetization alters the onset of the transition from a linear-like mode to a spin-wave bullet mode. Magnetic damping primarily affects the threshold current with negligible impact on auto-oscillation frequency tunability. The threshold current scales linearly with increased magnetic damping at a constant out-of-plane field but exhibits a parabolic behavior with variations in out-of-plane fields. This behavior is attributed to the qualitatively distinct evolution of the auto-oscillation mode across different out-of-plane field values. Our study not only extends the versatility of SHNOs for oscillator-based neuromorphic computing with controllable frequency tunability but also unveils the intricate auto-oscillation dynamics in out-of-plane fields.
