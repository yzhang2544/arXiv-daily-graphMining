    "abstract": "In this study, a novel electric field compressor is proposed by doping a metal-air-metal pillar in epsilon-near-zero medium within a metallic waveguide, which effectively enhances the background electric fields in a sub-wavelength air pillar with high uniformity. The field enhancement factor can be analytically determined through theoretical derivations from Maxwell's equations, reaching its maximum value by appropriately selecting the size of the air pillar. Furthermore, the proposed compressor can achieve a tunable electric field enhancement effect within the deep sub-wavelength air pillar by adjusting the height of the air pillar through movement of two metal pillars inserted into the waveguide. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are employed to validate the performance of the electric field compressor, which exhibits a wide range of tunable field enhancement effect (i.e., continuously adjustable enhancement factor between 20 and 800) with uniformity below 1.5 within the deep sub-wavelength air pillar (wherein the air volume is smaller than la0/10 * la0/10 * la0/16). Finally, a practical model is proposed for the realization of the electric field compressor in the microwave range, where specially placed metal pillars and wires are incorporated into a rectangular metallic waveguide structure. The field enhancement and tunable effects of this practical model have been verified through simulations. ",

    "abstract": "We present a liquid-crystal laser device based on the chiral ferroelectric nematic phase (NF*). The laser medium is obtained by mixing a ferroelectric nematic material with a chiral agent and a small proportion of a fluorescent dye. Notably, in the NF* phase very low electric fields perpendicular to the helical axis are able to reorient the molecules, giving rise to a periodic structure whose director profile is not single harmonic but contains the contribution of various Fourier components. This feature induces the appearance of several photonic bandgaps whose spectral ranges depend on the field, which can be exploited to build tunable laser devices. Here we report the characterization of home-made NF* lasers that can be tunable under low electric fields and present laser action in two of the photonic bands of the material. The obtained results open a promising route for the design of new and more versatile liquid-crystal based lasers. ",

    "abstract": "Phonon lasers, as mechanical analogues of optical lasers, are unique tools for not only fundamental studies of phononics but also diverse applications such as acoustic imaging and force sensing. Very recently, by levitating a micro-size sphere in an optical tweezer, higher-order mechanical harmonics were observed in the phonon-lasing regime, as the first step towards nonlinear levitated optomechanics [Nat. Phys. 19, 414 (2023)]. However, both the lasing strengths and the quality factors of the observed harmonics are typically very low, thus severely hindering their applications. Here we show that, by applying a simple but powerful electronic control to such a levitated micro-sphere, three orders of magnitude enhancement are achievable in the brightness of the phonon lasers, including both the fundamental mode and all its higher-order harmonics. Also, giant improvements of their linewidth and frequency stability are realized in such an electro-optomechanical system, together with further improved higher-order phonon coherence. These results, as a significant step forward for enhancing and controlling micro-object phonon lasers, can be readily used for a wide range of applications involving nonlinear phonon lasers, such as acoustic frequency comb, ultra-sound sensing, atmospherical monitoring, and even bio-medical diagnosis of levitated micro-size objects.

    "abstract": "Although several efforts have been taken to enhance the photonic spin Hall shift in deep-subwavelength region, according to effective medium theory, the fundamental confliction between near-zero reflection coefficient and near-zero incident angle still hinders the further application. Here, we reveal a fundamental breakdown of effective medium theory due to the existing of topological singularity in deep-subwavelength region in one-dimensional photonic crystals. We find that near the topological singularity, huge photonic spin Hall shift can be achieved for s-polarization and p-polarization. At the topological singularity, the reflected filed is split as dipole-like distribution with zero photonic spin Hall shift for both-polarizations, which is resulted from the interfere of the spin-maintained normal light and spin-flipped abnormal light. Based on the theoretical research, dual-polarizations thickness and dielectric constant sensing devices can be designed in deep-subwavelength region. Further more, by applying more complicated layered structure, multi-channels dual-polarizations detection and broadband dual-polarizations huge spin Hall shift platform can be designed. This work paves the way to exploring the topological properties and polarization control of photonic crystals and provides a prospective method for the design of multi-channels sensitive detection spin optical devices.

Here, we demonstrate enzyme delivery-trapping and dynamic manipulation at the single-entity level by employing photothermal-assisted trapping via metamaterial optical tweezers at low trapping laser intensities. By analyzing the probability density function, we are able to distinguish dielectric particles from biomolecules. For enzyme-related data, the presence of two peaks in violin plots indicates conformational changes or interactions with the environment. We also observe that increasing the laser intensity increases the local temperature, resulting in enzyme aggregation. This study provides an alternative approach for identifying single enzymes and dielectric particles by combining plasmonic fields and photothermal heat, while paving the way for label-free characterization of biomolecules at the single-particle level.

However, such short pulses are significantly more susceptible to broadening in a microscope's highly dispersive optical elements and require careful dispersion management, otherwise decreasing excitation efficiency. Here, we show that efficient excitation is possible using picosecond pulses with a reduced repetition rate. We have developed a high-energy Yb:fiber laser with an integrated pulse picker unit and compared its performance in multiphoton microscopy for two different settings: 205 fs pulse duration at 15 MHz, and 10 ps at 0.3 MHz. Ensuring the same duty cycle and average power for both pulse trains, we have shown that picosecond pulses with a reduced repetition frequency can produce significantly higher pixel intensities. These findings proved that the temporal compression of fiber lasers is not always efficient, and it can be omitted by using a smaller and easier-to-use all-fiber setup. ",

    "abstract": "Low-cost particulate matter sensors (LCS) are an important source of air quality data, improving the spatial and temporal resolution of data gathered by sparsely placed official monitoring stations. Their readings, however, are subject to bias due to unaccounted for effects that pertain to both the physical properties of the aerosol particles and design limitations of the devices. A calibration model is paramount in order to valorize the output of LCS devices. In this paper, a calibration model is developed for the LCS network of the municipality of Timisoara, Romania. A regression approach is used for calibrating the PM10 measurements. A number of models are tested, considering as independent variables the LCS PM10 readings, relative humidity, and temperature. Model versions with physics-based corrections for relative humidity are found to work best. The calibrated data is tested against the measurements of collocated stations from the National Air Quality Monitoring Network (NAQMN), showing an average performance of nRMSE=7.58ug/m3 and R2=0.31. The calibration model is applied to the city-wide LCS network of the municipality. The yearly average PM10 of the LCS network is shown to be similar to that from the NAQMN, both being well within the EU standard for yearly PM10. When looking at daily PM10 values, however, several stations are found that regularly exceed the daily threshold set by the European Union. These violations are not witnessed at the NAQMN stations. This is interpreted as due to the small number of reference stations located in the administrative boundaries of the city, which miss particular point sources that are not collocated with these stations.

Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of measured physical parameters deviate from true PDFs due to resolution, bias, and efficiency effects. Good estimates of the true PDF are necessary for testing theoretical models, comparing results from different experiments, and combining results from various research endeavors. In the article, the histogram method is employed to estimate both the measured and true PDFs. The binning of histograms is determined using the K-means clustering algorithm. The true PDF is estimated through the maximization of the likelihood function with entropy regularization, utilizing a non-linear optimization algorithm specially designed for this purpose. The accuracy of the results is assessed using the Mean Integrated Square Error. To determine the optimal value for the regularization parameter, a bootstrap method is applied. Additionally, a mathematical model of the measurement system is formulated using system identification methods. This approach enhances the robustness and precision of the estimation process, providing a more reliable analysis of the system's characteristics. ",
