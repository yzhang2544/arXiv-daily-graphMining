The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method. ",

    "abstract": "Signal-to-noise ratio optimization, regarding repetition time selection, was explored mathematically and experimentally for single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Theoretical findings were benchmarked against phantom measurements at 1.5 Tesla and localized in vivo proton brain spectra acquired at both 1.5 Tesla/3.0 Tesla. A detailed mathematical description of signal-to-noise ratio per unit time was derived, yielding an optimal repetition time of 1.256 times the metabolite longitudinal relaxation time. While long-repetition-time acquisitions minimize longitudinal relaxation time contributions, a repetition time of ~1.5s results in maximum signal-to-noise ratio per unit time, which can in turn be invested into smaller voxel sizes. The latter is of utmost importance in brain oncology, allowing accurate spectroscopic characterization of small lesions. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the projects LIFE (Laser Inertial Fusion Energy) in USA and HiPER (High Power Laser Energy Research) in Europe are the most advanced ones to demonstrate laser fusion energy viability. One of the main points of concern to properly achieve ignition is the performance of the final optics (lenses) under the severe irradiation conditions that take place in fusion facilities. In this paper, we calculate the radiation fluxes and doses as well as the radiation-induced temperature enhancement and colour centre formation in final lenses assuming realistic geometrical configurations for HiPER and LIFE. On these bases, the mechanical stresses generated by the established temperature gradients are evaluated showing that from a mechanical point of view lenses only fulfill specifications if ions resulting from the imploding target are mitigated. The absorption coefficient of the lenses is calculated during reactor startup and steady-state operation. The obtained results evidence the necessity of new solutions to tackle ignition problems during the startup process for HiPER. Finally, we evaluated the effect of temperature gradients on focal length changes and lens surface deformations. In summary, we discuss the capabilities and weak points of silica lenses and propose alternatives to overcome predictable problems. ",

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian physics has greatly enriched our understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena and uncovered novel effects such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that has profoundly revolutionized the field. NHSE is typically predicted in systems with nonreciprocal couplings which, however, are difficult to realize in experiments. Without nonreciprocal couplings, the NHSE can also emerge in systems with coexisting gauge fields and loss or gain (e.g., in Floquet non-Hermitian systems). However, such Floquet NHSE remains largely unexplored in experiments. Here, we realize the Floquet NHSEs in periodically modulated optical waveguides integrated on a silicon photonics platform. By engineering the artificial gauge fields induced by the periodical modulation, we observe various Floquet NHSEs and unveil their rich topological transitions. Remarkably, we discover the transitions between the normal unipolar NHSEs and an unconventional bipolar NHSE which is accompanied by the directional reversal of the NHSEs. The underlying physics is revealed by the band winding in complex quasienergy space which undergoes a topology change from isolated loops with the same winding to linked loops with opposite windings. Our work unfolds a new route toward Floquet NHSEs originating from the interplay between gauge fields and dissipation effects and offers fundamentally new ways for steering light and other waves. ",

We demonstrate that the piezo-charge, piezo-voltage, and impedance of the devices can be directly correlated using an equivalent circuit model. The performance figure of merit (FoM) of nanowire-based VINGs, namely the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) for sensing, and the product gxd for energy harvesting, where d is a piezoelectric charge constant, are extracted from our presented results and compared with that of bulk single crystal GaN and quartz substrates, as well as sputtered AlN thin films. The measured FoM values suggest that the nanowires can outperform their rigid counterparts in terms of mechanical sensing applications, while further improvements are required to enhance their capability for energy generation. This work not only provides new experimental guidelines for understanding the direct piezo-characteristics of VINGs, but it also enables a quantitative comparison between nanostructured piezoelectric devices fabricated using different materials or architectures.

    "abstract": "We derive a nonlinear acoustic wave propagation model for analysing the thermoviscous dissipation in narrow pores with wavy walls. As the nonlinear waves propagate in the thermoviscous pores, the wave-steepening effect competes with the bulk dissipation, as well as the thermoviscous heat transfer and shear from the pore walls. Consequently, the length scale of the wave is modified. We use the characteristic nonlinear wave thickness scale to obtain linear and nonlinear wave equations governing the unsteady shock-wall interaction. We also perform two-dimensional shock-resolved DNS of the wave propagation inside the pores and compare the results with model equations. We show that for flat-walls and shock strength parameter $\\epsilon$, the dimensional wall heat-flux and shear scale as $\\epsilon$. For wavy walls, the scaling becomes $\\epsilon^{3/2 - n(k)}$ where $k$ is the wall-waviness wavenumber and the exponent $n$ increases from $0.5$ for $k=0$ to $n(k)\\approx0.65$ for $k=10$, $n(k)\\approx 0.75$ for $k=20$, and $n(k)\\approx0.85$ for $k=40$. Hence, increasing the wall waviness reduces the dependence of the wall heat-flux and shear on nonlinear acoustic wave strength. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum dynamics simulations are becoming a standard tool for simulating photo-excited molecular systems involving a manifold of coupled states, known as non-adiabatic dynamics. While these simulations have had many successes in explaining experiments and giving details of non-adiabatic transitions, the question remains as to their predictive power. In this work, we present a set of quantum dynamics simulations on cyclobutanone, using both grid-based multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) and direct dynamics variational multi-configuration Gaussian (DD-vMCG) methods. The former used a parameterised vibronic coupling model Hamiltonian and the latter generated the potential energy surfaces on-the-fly. The results give a picture of the non-adiabatic behaviour of this molecule and were used to calculate the signal from a gas-phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) experiment. Corresponding experimental results will be obtained and presented at a later stage for comparison to test the predictive power of the methods. The results show that over the first 500 fs after photo-excitation to the S$_2$ state, cyclobutanone relaxes quickly to the S$_1$ state, but only a small population relaxes further to the S$_0$ state. No significant transfer of population to the triplet manifold is found. It is predicted that the GUED experiments over this time scale will see s signal related mostly to the C-O stretch motion and elongation of the molecular ring along the C-C-O axis. ",

We find an asymptotic upper bound to this additional accumulation, providing a worst-case prediction, and observe that this depends upon the residual dispersion within the link. This upper bound scales similarly to the self-channel interference (SCI) accumulation, and is well characterized by the parameters of the underlying fiber spans and the transmitted signals. ",

It is founded on Gaussian processes and a Monte Carlo sampling procedure, and assumes knowledge about the uncertainties associated with a manufacturing process. The approach itself is iterative. First, a large parameter domain is sampled in a coarse fashion. This coarse sampling is used primarily to determine smaller candidate regions to investigate in a second, more refined sampling pass. This finer step is used to obtain an estimate of the expected performance of the found design parameter under the assumed manufacturing uncertainties. We apply the presented approach to the robust optimization of the Purcell enhancement of a photonic crystal nanobeam cavity. We obtain a predicted robust Purcell enhancement of $\\overline{F}_{\\mathrm{P}} \\approx 3.3$. For comparison we also perform an optimization without robustness. We find that an unrobust optimum of $F_{\\mathrm{P}} \\approx 256.5$ dwindles to only $\\overline{F}_{\\mathrm{P}} \\approx 0.7$ when fabrication uncertainties are taken into account. We thus demonstrate that the presented approach is able to find designs of significantly higher performance than those obtained with conventional optimization. ",

This paper creatively applies statistical methods to the field of traffic, particularly focusing on the preprocessing of multi-frame signals obtained by optical fiber-based Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system. An online non-parametric regression model based on Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) and variable bandwidth selection is employed to dynamically update the estimation of mean function as signals flow in. This mean estimation method can derive average information of multi-frame fiber signals, thus providing the basis for the subsequent vehicle trajectory extraction algorithms. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparison experiments were conducted under real highway scenarios, showing that our approach not only deals with multi-frame signals more accurately than the classical filter-based Kalman and Wavelet methods, but also meets the needs better under the condition of saving memory and rapid responses. It provides a new reliable means for signal processing which can be integrated with other existing methods. ",

To address this issue, we model the relationship between the received power and transceiver jitter by making use of a moment-based density function approximation method. Based on this relationship, we incorporate the transceiver jitter effects in combination with Poisson distribution. The error rate results are obtained assuming on-off key modulation with optimal threshold based detection. We validate the error rate expressions by comparing the analytical results with Monte-Carlo simulation results. The results show that the transceiver jitter effects cause performance degradation especially in smaller transceiver elevation angles or in shorter distances, which are often adopted in short-range ultraviolet communications. The results also show that larger elevation angle cases have a better performance with respect to anti-jitter and may perform better compared to smaller elevation angle situations in the case of larger standard deviation of jitter. This work studies for the first time the transceiver jitter effects in ultraviolet communications and provides guidelines for experimental system design. ",
