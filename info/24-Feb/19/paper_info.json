    "title": "Plasma-wall interaction in laser inertial fusion reactors: novel  proposals for radiation tests of first wall materials",
    "abstract": "Dry-wall laser inertial fusion (LIF) chambers will have to withstand strong bursts of fast charged particles which will deposit tens of kJ m$^{-2}$ and implant more than 10$^{18}$ particles m$^{-2}$ in a few microseconds at a repetition rate of some Hz. Large chamber dimensions and resistant plasma-facing materials must be combined to guarantee the chamber performance as long as possible under the expected threats: heating, fatigue, cracking, formation of defects, retention of light species, swelling and erosion. Current and novel radiation resistant materials for the first wall need to be validated under realistic conditions. However, at present there is a lack of facilities which can reproduce such ion environments. This contribution proposes the use of ultra-intense lasers and high-intense pulsed ion beams (HIPIB) to recreate the plasma conditions in LIF reactors. By target normal sheath acceleration, ultra-intense lasers can generate very short and energetic ion pulses with a spectral distribution similar to that of the inertial fusion ion bursts, suitable to validate fusion materials and to investigate the barely known propagation of those bursts through background plasmas/gases present in the reactor chamber. HIPIB technologies, initially developed for inertial fusion driver systems, provide huge intensity pulses which meet the irradiation conditions expected in the first wall of LIF chambers and thus can be used for the validation of materials too.

    "abstract": "Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration. ",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, photonic Chern materials have attracted substantial interest as they feature topological edge states that are robust against disorder, promising to realize defect-agnostic integrated photonic crystal slab devices. However, the out-of-plane radiative losses in those photonic Chern slabs has been previously neglected, yielding limited accuracy for predictions of these systems' topological protection. Here, we develop a general framework for measuring the topological protection in photonic systems, such as in photonic crystal slabs, while accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane radiative losses. Our approach relies on the spectral localizer that combines the position and Hamiltonian matrices of the system to draw a real-picture of the system's topology. This operator-based approach to topology allows us to use an effective Hamiltonian directly derived from the full-wave Maxwell equations after discretization via finite-elements method (FEM), resulting in the full account of all the system's physical processes. As the spectral FEM-localizer is constructed solely from FEM discretization of the system's master equation, the proposed framework is applicable to any physical system and is compatible with commonly used FEM software. Moving forward, we anticipate the generality of the method to aid in the topological classification of a broad range of complex physical systems. ",

    "abstract": "The Katz centrality of a node in a complex network is a measure of the node's importance as far as the flow of information across the network is concerned. For ensembles of locally tree-like and undirected random graphs, this observable is a random variable. Its full probability distribution is of interest but difficult to handle analytically because of its \"global\" character and its definition in terms of a matrix inverse. Leveraging a fast Gaussian Belief Propagation-cavity algorithm to solve linear systems on a tree-like structure, we show that (i) the Katz centrality of a single instance can be computed recursively in a very fast way, and (ii) the probability $P(K)$ that a random node in the ensemble of undirected random graphs has centrality $K$ satisfies a set of recursive distributional equations, which can be analytically characterized and efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. We test our solution on ensembles of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and scale-free networks in the locally tree-like regime, with excellent agreement. The distributions display a crossover between multimodality and unimodality as the mean degree increases, where distinct peaks correspond to the contribution to the centrality coming from nodes of different degrees. We also provide an approximate formula based on a rank-$1$ projection that works well if the network is not too sparse, and we argue that an extension of our method could be efficiently extended to tackle analytical distributions of other centrality measures such as PageRank for directed networks in a transparent and user-friendly way.

In a ring resonator, this leads to the interesting effect that light preferably circulates in one direction or in one polarization state. Applications of this effect range from chip-integrated optical diodes to nonlinear polarization controllers and optical gyroscopes. In this work, we study Kerr-nonlinearity-induced symmetry breaking of light states in coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). We discover a new type of controllable symmetry breaking that leads to emerging patterns of dark and bright resonators within the chains. Beyond stationary symmetry broken states, we observe periodic oscillations, switching and chaotic fluctuations of circulating powers in the resonators. Our findings are of interest for controlled multiplexing of light in photonic integrated circuits, neuromorphic computing, topological photonics and soliton frequency combs in coupled resonators. ",

Semiconductorsources, owing to the high refractive index of the medium, often exploit photonic cavities to enhance the external emission of photons into a well-defined optical mode. Optical Tamm States (OTS), in which light is confined between a distributed Bragg reflector and a thin metal layer have attracted interest as confined Tamm structures are readily manufactureable broadband cavities. Their effficiency is limited however by the absorption inherent in the metal layer. We propose a nanoring Tamm structure in which a nanoscale patterned annular metasurface is exploited to reduce this absorption and thereby enhance emission efficiency. To this end, we present designs for a nanoring Tamm structure optimised for the telecommunications O band, and demonstrate a near doubling of output efficiency (35%) over an analogous solid disc confined Tamm structure (18%). Simulations of designs optimised for different wavelengths are suggestive of annular coupling between the Tamm state and surface plasmons. These designs are applicable to the design of single photon sources, nanoLEDs, and nanolasers for communications. ",

Here we demonstrate the implications of these laws for optical sensing. We consider the standard goal of resonant optical sensors, namely to report a perturbation to their resonance frequency. In this context, we quantify the sensing precision attained using a finite energy budget combined with time or ensemble averaging of the time-integrated intensity. We find that ensemble averaging outperforms time averaging for short measurement times, but the advantage disappears as the measurement time increases. We explain this behavior in terms of weak ergodicity breaking, arising when the time for the time-integrated intensity to explore the entire phase space diverges but the measurement time remains finite. Evidence that the former time diverges is presented in first passage and return time distributions. Our results are relevant to all types of sensors, in optics and beyond, where stochastic time-integrated fields or intensities are measured to detect an event. In particular, choosing the right averaging strategy can improve sensing precision by orders of magnitude with zero energy cost. ",

    "title": "Identification is Pointless: Quantum Reference Frames, Localisation of  Events, and the Quantum Hole Argument",
    "abstract": "The study of quantum reference frames (QRFs) is motivated by the idea of taking into account the quantum properties of the reference frames that we use, explicitly or implicitly, in our description of physical systems. Like a classical reference frame, a QRF can be used to define physical quantities such as time, position, momentum, and spin relationally. Unlike its classical analogue, it relativises the notions of superposition and entanglement. Here, we provide a novel explanation for the frame-dependence of superposition and entanglement by tracing it back to the question of how configurations or locations are identified across different branches in superposition. We show that, in the presence of symmetries, whether a system is in 'the same' or 'different' configurations across the branches depends on the choice of QRF. Thus, sameness and difference-and, as a result, superposition and entanglement-lose their absolute meaning. We apply these ideas to semi-classical spacetimes in superposition and use coincidences of four scalar fields to construct a comparison map between the spacetime points in the different branches. This allows us to determine whether a given event is located at 'the same' or 'different' points in the superposed spacetimes. Since this feature depends on the choice of QRF, we argue that the localisation of an event should not be seen as an inherent property. This alleviates previously voiced concerns that QRF changes could have empirical consequences for interference experiments, such as the BMV proposal. Moreover, it implies that the number of events is equal in both the flat and the curved spacetime implementations of indefinite causal order. We conclude with the 'quantum hole argument' as a generalisation of Einstein's hole argument, arguing that not just spacetime points but also their identification across a superposition lose their absolute physical meaning.

Moreover, their adaptability to diverse structures, ranging from traditional electronics to nanopatterned frameworks, underscores their pivotal role in shaping quantum technologies. Despite notable strides in synthesis, certain properties require refinement for enhanced applicability in quantum information, encompassing emission brightness, stability, single photon indistinguishability, and entanglement fidelity of photon pairs. Here we offer an overview of recent achievements in plasmon-exciton quantum emitters based on luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals. Emphasizing the utilization of the light-matter coupling phenomenon, we explore how this interaction enables the manipulation of quantum properties without altering the chemical structure of the emitters. This approach addresses critical aspects for quantum information applications, offering precise control over emission rate, intensity, and energy. The development of these hybrid systems represents a significant stride forward, demonstrating their potential to overcome existing challenges and advance the integration of quantum emitters into cutting-edge quantum technology applications.

In particular, we formulate a master constraint corresponding to Hamilton and Gauss constraints using loop quantum gravity methods. To make the problem amenable for numerical simulation we fix a graph and introduce a cutoff on the kinematical degrees of freedom, effectively considering U$_q$(1) BF theory at a root of unity. We show that the Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS) ansatz can be used to numerically solve the constraints efficiently and accurately.

In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states.

It is defined as $Q\\equiv R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases $R_q /L_0 \\lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \\gg 1$, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum mechanics works in biological systems.
