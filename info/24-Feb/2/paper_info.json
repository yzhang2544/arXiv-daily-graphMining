    "abstract": "InN quantum dots (QDs) are considered to be promising nanostructures for different device applications. For any hexagonal AB stacking semiconductor system, polarity is an important feature which affects the electronic properties. Therefore, the determination of this characteristic on any wurtzite (semi)polar III nitride compound or alloy is essential for defining its applicability. In this paper, the polarity of InN QDs grown on silicon by indium droplet epitaxy plus nitridation and annealing was determined by a modified approach combining exit wave reconstruction with negative spherical aberration high resolution lattice imaging using TEM. Comparing the micrographs of two QDs from the same TEM specimen with the simulated images of InN slab structures generated under the same conditions as of the experiments, it was confirmed that the QDs of the present study are N polar. Given that the settlement of material's polarity has always been a tedious, indirect and controversial issue, the major value of our proposal is to provide a straightforward procedure to determine the polar direction from atomic-resolution focal series images.

    "abstract": "In practical sensing tasks, noise is usually regarded as an obstruction to better performance and will degrade the sensitivity. Fortunately, \\textit{stochastic resonance} (SR), a counterintuitive concept, can utilize noise to greatly enhance the detected signal amplitude. Although fundamentally important as a mechanism of weak signal amplification, and has been continually explored in geological, biological, and physical science, both theoretically and experimentally, SR has yet to be demonstrated in realistic sensing tasks. Here we develop a novel SR-based nonlinear sensor using a thermal ensemble of interacting Rydberg atoms. With the assistance of stochastic noise (either inherently in the system or added externally) and strong nonlinearity in the Rydberg ensembles, the signal encoded in a weak MW field is greatly enhanced (over 25 dB). Moreover, we show that the SR-based atomic sensor can achieve a better sensitivity in our system, which is over 6.6 dB compared to a heterodye atomic sensor. Our results show potential advantage of SR-based MW sensors in commercial or defense-related applications. ",

The HHG process typically involves light interactions with gases or plasma-material phases that hinder wider adoption of such sources. This motivates the research in HHG from nanostructured solids. Here we investigate theoretically material platforms for HHG at the nanoscale using first-principle supercomputer simulations. We reveal that wide bandgap semiconductors, aluminium nitride AlN and silicon nitride SiN, are highly promising for XUV light generation when compared to one of the most common nonlinear nanophotonic material -- silicon. In our calculations we assume excitation with 100 fs pulse duration, 10^13 W/cm^2 peak power and 800 nm central wavelength. We demonstrate that in AlN material the interplay between the crystal symmetry and the incident light direction and polarization can enable the generation of both even and odd harmonics. Our results should advance the developments of high-harmonics generation of XUV light from nanostructured solids. ",

The impossibility of maintaining a stationary footprint on the sensing surface with a fixed rotation axis can be of high importance. This would be specially so if samples are not homogeneous such as in arrays for multiplexing. By theoretically analyzing the behavior of the walk-off during rotation around an arbitrary fixed axis, we find an optimal and simple configuration to minimize this effect. The proposed setup is experimentally tested to verify the results and to show its ease of implementation.

    "abstract": "Compared with electrical neural networks, optical neural networks (ONNs) have the potentials to break the limit of the bandwidth and reduce the consumption of energy, and therefore draw much attention in recent years. By far, several types of ONNs have been implemented. However, the current ONNs cannot realize the acceleration as powerful as that indicated by the models like quantum neural networks. How to construct and realize an ONN with the quantum speedup is a huge challenge. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a new type of optical convolutional neural network by introducing the optical correlation. It is called the correlated optical convolutional neural network (COCNN). We show that the COCNN can exhibit quantum speedup in the training process. The character is verified from the two aspects. One is the direct illustration of the faster convergence by comparing the loss function curves of the COCNN with that of the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Such a result is compatible with the training performance of the recently proposed quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). The other is the demonstration of the COCNNs capability to perform the QCNN phase recognition circuit, validating the connection between the COCNN and the QCNN. Furthermore, we take the COCNN analog to the 3-qubit QCNN phase recognition circuit as an example and perform an experiment to show the soundness and the feasibility of it. The results perfectly match the theoretical calculations. Our proposal opens up a new avenue for realizing the ONNs with the quantum speedup, which will benefit the information processing in the era of big data. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we present an integrated photogrammetric-acoustic technique that, together with the construction of a scaled wind tunnel, allows us to experimentally analyze the permeability behavior of a new type of acoustic screens based on a material called sonic crystal. Acoustic screens are devices used to reduce the noise, mostly due to the communication infrastructures, in its transmission phase from the source to the receiver. The main constructive difference between these new screens and the classic ones is that the first ones are formed by arrays of acoustic scatterers while the second ones are formed by continuous walls. This implies that, due to their geometry, screens based on sonic crystals are permeable to wind and water, unlike the classic ones. This fact may allow the use of these new screens in sandy soils, where sand would pass through the screen avoiding the formation of sand dunes that are formed in classic screens and drastically reduce their acoustic performance. In this work, the movement of the sand and the resulting acoustic attenuation in these new screens are analyzed qualitatively comparing the results with those obtained with the classic ones, obtaining interesting results under the acoustic point of view ",

    "abstract": "With a seminal work of Raghu and Haldane in 2008, concepts of topology have been successfully introduced in a wide range of optical systems, emulating specific lattice Hamiltonians. Certainly, one of the most promising routes to an application of topological photonics in an actual device are topological lasers, where efficient and highly coherent lasing from a topologically non-trivial mode is achieved. While some attempts have been made to excite such structures electrically, the majority of published fundamental experiments use a form of laser excitation. In this paper, we use a lattice of vertical resonator polariton micropillars to form an exponentially localized topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger defect. Upon electrical excitation of the p-i-n doped structure, the system unequivocally shows polariton lasing from the topological defect using a carefully placed gold contact. Despite the presence of doping and electrical contacts, the polariton band structure clearly preserves its topological properties. At high excitation power the Mott density is exceeded leading to highly efficient lasing in the weak coupling regime. This work is an important step towards applied topological lasers using vertical resonator microcavity structures. ",

Despite the abundance of methods and materials for converting light into electrical signals, the use of metals in this context has been relatively limited. Nanostructures supporting surface plasmons in metals offer precise light manipulation and induce light-driven electron motion. Through inverse design optimization of a gold nanostructure, we demonstrate enhanced volumetric, unidirectional, intense, and ultrafast photocurrents via a magneto-optical process derived from the inverse Faraday effect. This is achieved through fine-tuning the amplitude, polarization, and their gradients in the local light field. The virtually instantaneous process allows dynamic photocurrent modulation by varying optical pulse duration, potentially yielding nanosources of intense, ultrafast, planar magnetic fields, and frequency-tunable THz emission. These findings opens avenues for ultrafast magnetic material manipulation and holds promise for nanoscale THz spectroscopy. ",

This work introduces several new generative adversarial network models based on engineering integration of parametrized quantum circuits into known molecular generative adversarial networks. The introduced machine learning models incorporate a new multi-parameter reward function grounded in reinforcement learning principles. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark drug design datasets, QM9 and PC9, the introduced models are shown to outperform scores achieved previously. Most prominently, the new scores indicate an increase of up to 30% in the druglikeness quantitative estimation. The new hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms, as well as the achieved scores of pharmacokinetic properties, contribute to the development of fast and accurate drug discovery processes. ",

However, RIXS requires a narrow bandwidth x-ray probe to achieve high spectral resolution. The challenges in delivering an energetic monochromated beam from an x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) thus limit its use in few-shot experiments, including for the study of high energy density systems. Here we demonstrate that by correlating the measurements of the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) spectrum of an XFEL with the RIXS signal, using a dynamic kernel deconvolution with a neural surrogate, we can achieve electronic structure resolutions substantially higher than those normally afforded by the bandwidth of the incoming x-ray beam. We further show how this technique allows us to discriminate between the valence structures of Fe and Fe$_2$O$_3$, and provides access to temperature measurements as well as M-shell binding energies estimates in warm-dense Fe compounds.

In earthquake engineering practice, accurate data is pivotal in predicting the response of structure or damage detection process in an Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) application with less uncertainty. However, obtaining high-resolution data is fraught with challenges, such as significant costs, extensive data channels, and substantial storage requirements. To address these challenges, this study employs super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGANs) to improve the resolution of time-history data such as the data obtained by a sensor network in an SHM application, marking the first application of SRGANs in earthquake engineering domain. The time-series data are transformed into RGB values, converting raw data into images. SRGANs are then utilized to upscale these low-resolution images, thereby enhancing the overall sensor resolution. This methodology not only offers potential reductions in data storage requirements but also simplifies the sensor network, which could result in lower installation and maintenance costs. The proposed SRGAN method is rigorously evaluated using real seismic data, and its performance is compared with traditional enhancement techniques. The findings of this study pave the way for cost-effective and efficient improvements in the resolution of sensors used in SHM systems, with promising implications for the safety and sustainability of infrastructures worldwide.

Using a combination of in-situ reflective high energy electron diffraction and ex situ X ray diffraction (XRD), we show that the NWs grow nearly strain free, preferentially perpendicular to the amorphous SiO2 interlayer and without epitaxial relationship to Si(111) substrate, as expected. Scanning electron microscopy investigation reveals significant NWs coalescence, which results in their progressively increasing diameter and formation of columnar structures with non hexagonal cross section. Making use of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the NWs initial diameters are found in the 20 to 30 nm range. In addition, the formation of a thin (30 nm) polycrystalline AlN layer is observed on the substrate surface. Regarding the structural quality of the AlN NWs, STEM measurements reveal the formation of extended columnar regions, which grow with a virtually perfect metal-polarity wurtzite arrangement and with extended defects only sporadically observed. Combination of STEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveals the formation of continuous aluminum oxide (1 to 2 nm) on the NW surface. Low temperature photoluminescence measurements reveal a single near band edge (NBE) emission peak, positioned at 6.03 eV (at 2 K), a value consistent with nearly zero NW strain evidenced by XRD and in agreement with the values obtained on AlN bulk layers synthesized by other growth techniques. The significant full width at half maximum of NBE emission, found at 20 meV (at 2 K), suggests that free and bound excitons are mixed together within this single emission band. ",

In particular, our findings reveal that the prototypical delayed FitzHugh-Nagumo model previously employed to model the RTD-LD resembles our more realistic model only in the limit of a slow RTD. We show that the RTD time scale plays a critical role in memory capacity as it governs a shift in pulse interaction from repulsive to attractive, leading to a transition from stable to unstable multi-pulse TLSs. Our theoretical analysis uncovers novel features and challenges, including the multistability of TLSs and attractive interaction forces, stemming from the previously neglected intrinsic dynamics of the laser. These effects are crucial to consider since they define the memory properties of the RTD-LD. ",

We analyze band structure features and loss rates of low mode volume bowtie cavities in diamond and demonstrate independent design control over cavity-emitter coupling strength and loss rates. Further, using silicon vacancy centers in diamond as exemplary emitters, we investigate the influence of placement imprecision. We find that the benefit on photon collection efficiency and indistinguishability is limited, while the fabrication complexity of ultra-small cavity designs increases substantially compared to conventional photonic crystals. We conclude that ultra-small mode volume designs are primarily of interest for dispersive spin-photon interactions, which are of great interest for future quantum networks. ",

    "title": "Quantum Nonlocality: how does Nature do it?",
    "abstract": "We answer the question asked by Nicolas Gisin in his article in Science few years ago. He claimed that quantum correlations are coming from outside space time. We explain that Bell Tests allow only rejecting probabilistic coupling provided by a local hidden variable model, but they do not justify metaphysical speculations about quantum nonlocality and objects which know about each other state, even when separated by large distances. We claim that the violation of Bell inequalities in physics and in cognitive science can be explained using the notion of Bohr contextuality. If contextual variables, describing varying experimental contexts, are correctly incorporated into a probabilistic model, then the inequalities cannot be proven and nonlocal correlations may be explained in an intuitive way. We elucidate the meaning of statistical independence assumption called incorrectly: free choice, measurement independence or no conspiracy. Since the correlation does not mean causation the violation of statistical independence should be rather called contextuality and it does not restrict experimenter freedom of choice. Therefore, contrary to what is believed, closing freedom of choice loophole does not prove statistical independence. We claim that quantum correlations are not coming from outside space time, but instead they are due to global space time symmetries. ",

    "abstract": "We present an interferometric sensor for investigating macroscopic quantum mechanics on a table-top scale. The sensor consists of pair of suspended optical cavities with a finesse in excess of 100,000 comprising 10 g fused-silica mirrors. In the current room-temperature operation, we achieve a peak sensitivity of \\SI{0.5}{\\fmasd} in the acoustic frequency band, limited by the readout noise. With additional suppression of the readout noise, we will be able to reach the quantum radiation pressure noise, which would represent a novel measurement of the quantum back-action effect. Such a sensor can eventually be utilised for demonstrating macroscopic entanglement and testing semi-classical and quantum gravity models. ",
