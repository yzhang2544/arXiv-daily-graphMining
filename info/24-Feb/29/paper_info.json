    "abstract": "DNA flexibility is a key determinant of biological function, from nucleosome positioning to transcriptional regulation, motivating a direct measurement of the bend-torque response of individual DNA molecules. In this work, DNA bending is detected using a nano-mechanical torque balance formed by tethering a ferromagnetic nanoparticle probe by an individual DNA molecule to a diamond magnetic field imager. The torque exerted by the DNA in response to bending caused by an applied magnetic torque is measured using wide-field imaging of quantum defects near the surface of the diamond. Qualitative measurements of differences in DNA bio-mechanical binding configuration are demonstrated, and as a proof-of-principle, a quantitative measurement of the bend response is made for individual DNA molecules. This quantum-enabled measurement approach could be applied to characterize the bend response of biophysically relevant short DNA molecules as well as the sequence dependence of DNA bending energy. ",

The ions are generated by pulsed laser ablation and dynamically loaded into the ion trap by switching the trapping potential on and off. The loaded ions are precooled by buffer gas and then laser-cooled to form Coulomb crystals for verifying quantity. The number of ions is controlled by manipulating the trapping potential of the ion trap, partial pressure of buffer gas and turn-on time of the entrance end cap voltage. With single-pulse laser ablation, the number of trapped ions ranges from tens to ten thousand. The kinetic energy of loaded ions can be selected via the optimal turn-on time of the entrance end cap. Using multiple-pulse laser ablation, the number is further increased and reaches about $4 \\times 10^{4}$. The dynamic loading method has wide application for accumulating low-yielding ions via laser ablation in the ion trap. ",

    "abstract": "We present broadband dual frequency comb laser absorption measurements of 2% H$_2$O (natural isotopic abundance of 99.7% H$_2^{16}$O) in air from 6600-7650 cm$^{-1}$ (1307-1515 nm) with a spectral point spacing of 0.0068 cm$^{-1}$. Twenty-nine datasets were collected at temperatures between 300 and 1300 K ($\\pm$0.82% average uncertainty) and pressures ranging from 20 to 600 Torr ($\\pm$0.25%) with an average residual absorbance noise of 8.0E-4 across the spectrum for all measurements. We fit measurements using a quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile to determine 7088 absorption parameters for 3366 individual transitions found in HITRAN2020. These measurements build on the line strength, line center, self-broadening, and self-shift parameters determined in the Part I companion of this work. Here we measure air-broadened width (with temperature- and speed-dependence) and air pressure shift (with temperature dependence) parameters. Various trends are explored for extrapolation to weak transitions that were not covered in this work. Improvements made in this work are predominantly due to the inclusion of air pressure shift temperature dependence values. In aggregate, these updates improved RMS absorbance error by a factor of 4.2 on average, and the remaining residual is predominantly spectral noise. This updated database improves high temperature spectroscopic knowledge across the 6600 7650 cm$^{-1}$ region of H$_2$O absorption. ",

In this study, excess energy creation was observed during the single-shot irradiation of a polymer matrix containing plasmonic gold nanorods, resonant to the laser wavelength, with a high intensity femtosecond laser pulse. This effect was manifested in a 7-fold rise in the crater volume for a 1.7-fold increase of the laser intensity, and was absent in the pure polymer without the gold doping. It occurred at laser intensities > 1.5 x 1017 W/cm2, being the vanishing threshold of plasma mirror formation, resulting in a more than 80% increase of the amount of laser light entering the target. This threshold was found to be critical for the plasmonic effect of gold nanoantennas tuned to the wavelength of the laser on the crater formation. ",

    "abstract": "Fiber optic networks are used worldwide and have been regarded as excellent media for transmitting time-frequency (TF) signals. In the past decades, fiber-based TF synchronization techniques have been extensively studied. Instruments based on these techniques have been successfully applied. With the increasing application of TF synchronization instruments, their security has become an important issue. Unfortunately, the security risks of fiber-based frequency synchronization (FbFS) instruments have been overlooked. This paper proposes a frequency tampering method called \"frequency lens\". On a 200 km fiber link, we demonstrate a frequency tampering scenario using a frequency lens-enabled frequency tampering module (FTM). On the user side, the frequency value of the recovered 100 MHz signal can be stealthily altered within a range of 100 MHz-100 Hz to 100 MHz+100 Hz, while the frequency dissemination stability of the system remains normal. Related to this tampering risk, potential hazards in three different application scenarios, which rely on precise frequency references, are analyzed. Two countermeasures are also proposed to solve this tampering risk. ",

The process of wafer probing in its conventional contacting schemes, becomes more complicated as ICs move to smaller technology nodes and more compact designs, greatly increasing testing costs. Non-contact optical wafer probing can overcome physical probing complications, reducing costs, and increasing throughput and reliability. In this paper, a CMOS compatible, broadband (22 GHz), small footprint (5 {\\mu}m dia.) plasmonic electro-optic modulator of low insertion loss (4 dB) and wide optical working bandwidth (100 nm) is proposed and demonstrated as a potential solution for wafer-level optical testing. The device modulates in reflection an incident optical carrier emerging from an optical fiber in a non-contact arrangement, to work as a data output channel from the wafer. A modulation depth of over 2% is achieved which should be sufficient to meet the requirements of wafer-level testing. The device can be placed anywhere on wafer. ",

However, in many cases, the host matrix induces fluctuations of the emission wavelength in time, limiting the potential applications based on indistinguishable photons. A deep understanding of the underlying spectral diffusion processes is therefore of high importance for improving the stability of the light emission. Here, we theoretically investigate the photon statistics of an emitter driven by a resonant laser, and subject to either of two qualitatively different stationary spectral diffusion processes - a continuous diffusion process and a process based on discrete spectral jumps, both of which being known to model the spectral diffusion of various solid-state emitters. We show that the statistics of light emission carries several experimentally accessible signatures that allow to discriminate between the two classes of models, both at short times in the intensity correlation function, and at long times in the fluctuations of the integrated intensity. These results establish that resonant excitation combined with photon statistics offers a rich access to the spectral diffusion processes, yielding information that goes beyond the bare characterization of the inhomogeneous shape and noise correlation time. Incidentally, our findings shed a new light on recent experimental results of spectral diffusion of B centers in hexagonal boron nitride, providing more insight in their spectral diffusion mechanisms.

The analysis relies on a general uncertainty principle model that is consistent with most formulations of quantum gravity theory, where the canonical uncertainty relations are modified by a leading-order correction term that is linear in momentum. In turn, this correction modifies the magnetic moment of the spin-polarized $^{129}$Xe atoms that are immersed in a magnetic field in the proposed experiment, which results in a velocity-dependent variation of their Larmour frequency, that is detected via two-photon laser spectroscopy. The thermal distribution of atomic velocities, in conjunction with the Doppler effect, is used to scan the interrogating laser over different atomic velocities, and search for a corresponding variation in their Larmor frequencies. We show that the existing bounds on the leading-order quantum gravity correction can be improved by $10^{7}$ with existing technology, where another factor of $10^{2}$ is possible with near-future technical capabilities.

    "abstract": "Among supervised learning models, Support Vector Machine stands out as one of the most robust and efficient models for classifying data clusters. At the core of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubits gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square error smaller than 0.05. This result paves the way for the development of integrated photonic architectures capable of performing Quantum Machine Learning tasks with robust devices operating at room temperature. ",

We show that putting the dielectric in motion can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric permeability is similar to that of moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. Certain features of the susceptibility can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric because the vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced and and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit; it pertains to evanescent waves for (ii), but reaches the far-field domain for (i).

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of diverse chemical properties is crucial for advancing molecular design and materials discovery. Here we present a versatile approach that uses the intermediate information of a universal neural network potential as a general-purpose descriptor for chemical property prediction. Our method is based on the insight that by training a sophisticated neural network architecture for universal force fields, it learns transferable representations of atomic environments. We show that transfer learning with a graph neural network potential M3GNet achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods for predicting the NMR chemical shifts of$^1$H, $^{13}$C, $^{15}$N, $^{17}$O, and $^{19}$F using quantum machine learning as well as a standard classical regression model, despite the compactness of its descriptors. This work provides an efficient way to accurately predict properties, potentially accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials. ",
