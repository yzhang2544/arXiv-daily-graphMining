    "abstract": "Resonance is a topic included in most introductory physics courses. Any mechanical system experiences resonance if it is driven by a periodic force with a frequency that matches its natural frequency. There are plenty of simple demonstrations of the resonance phenomena of mechanical systems which can be set up using readily available items . This work presents a very simple approach to demonstrate the phenomena using just two spring scales. The experiment presented here performs a \"frequency sweep\" and is also very entertaining to watch. ",

    "abstract": "The Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM) is an instrument with a demonstrated capability to image electrical current in integrated circuits (ICs), which shows promise for detection of hardware Trojans. The anomalous current activity caused by hardware Trojans manifests through a magnetic field side channel that can be imaged with the QDM, potentially allowing for detection and localization of the effects of tampering. This paper seeks to identify the capabilities of the QDM for hardware Trojan detection through the analysis of previous QDM work as well as QDM physical limits and potential Trojan behaviors. QDM metrics of interest are identified, such as spatial resolution, sensitivity, time-to-result, and field-of-view. Rare event detection on an FPGA is demonstrated with the QDM. The concept of operations is identified for QDM utilization at different steps of IC development, noting necessary considerations and limiting factors for use at different development stages. Finally, the effects of hardware Trojans on IC current activity are estimated and compared to QDM sensitivities to project QDM detection potential for ICs of varying process sizes. ",

    "abstract": "We generate a tabletop pulsed relativistic electron beam at 100 Hz repetition rate from vacuum laser acceleration (VLA) by tightly focusing a radially polarized beam into a low-density gas. We demonstrate that strong longitudinal electric fields at the focus can accelerate electrons up to 1.43 MeV by using only 98 GW of peak laser power. The electron energy is measured as a function of laser intensity and gas species, revealing a strong dependence on the atomic ionization dynamics. These experimental results are supported by numerical simulations of particle dynamics in a tightly focused configuration that take ionization into consideration. For the range of intensities considered, it is demonstrated that atoms with higher atomic numbers like krypton can optimally inject electrons at the peak of the laser field, resulting in higher energies and an efficient acceleration mechanism that reaches a significant fraction of the theoretical energy gain limit.

Experiments using the OMEGA EP facility measured electrons accelerated to maximum energies exceeding 120 times the ponderomotive energy under certain laser focusing, pulse energy, and plasma density conditions. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that the laser focusing conditions alter the laser field evolution, channel fields generation, and electron oscillation, all of which contribute to the final electron energies. The optimal laser focusing condition occurs when the transverse oscillation amplitude of the accelerated electron in the channel fields matches the laser beam width, resulting in efficient energy gain. Through this observation, a simple model was developed to calculate the optimal laser focal spot size in more general conditions and is validated by experimental data. ",

    "abstract": "The growth in space activity has increased the need for Space Domain Awareness (SDA) to ensure safe space operations. Imaging and detecting space targets is, however, challenging due to their dim appearance, small angular size/separation, dense distribution, and atmospheric turbulence. These challenges render space targets in ground-based imaging observations as point-like objects in the sub-Rayleigh regime, with extreme brightness contrast but a low photon budget. Here, we propose to use the recently developed quantum-accelerated imaging (QAI) for the SDA challenge. We mainly focus on three SDA challenges (1) minimal a priori assumptions (2) many-object problem (3) extreme brightness ratio. We also present results on source estimation and localization in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. QAI shows significantly improved estimation in position, brightness, and number of targets for all SDA challenges. In particular, we demonstrate up to 2.5 times better performance in source detection than highly optimized direct imaging in extreme scenarios like stars with a 1000 times brightness ratio. With over 10,000 simulations, we verify the increased resolution of our approach compared to conventional state-of-the-art direct imaging paving the way towards quantum optics approaches for SDA. ",

Here, after preparing two elastically scattering $^{85}$Rb atoms in the three-dimensional ground-state in the optical tweezer, we employed this control in order to probe the colliding energies of elastic and inelastic channels. The combination of microwave spectra and corresponding s-wave pseudopotential model allows us to infer the effect of the state-dependent trapping potentials on the elastics colliding energies, as well as to reveal how the presence of inelastic interactions affects elastic part of the relative potential. Our work shows that the spin-motion coupling in a tight optical tweezer expand the experimental toolbox for fundamental studies of ultracold collisions in the two body systems with reactive collisions, and potentially for that of more complex interactions, such as optically trapped atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions.

To this end, we first developed a four-level rate equation model that simulates the optical pumping of Rf$^+$ from its ground state, $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), to the metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) state via laser resonant excitation of the intermediate $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^1$7p$^1$) state prior to electronic state chromatography. This model predicts a 93\\% pumping efficiency that suffices to enable efficient laser resonance chromatography of this ion. We then performed accurate relativistic Multi-Reference Configuration-Interaction (MRCI) calculations to model the interaction of Rf$^+$ with He in the ground $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), low-lying $^2$D$_{5/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), and metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) states. These ion-atom interaction potentials were used to calculate the state-specific ion mobilities. For gas temperatures above 100 K and small applied electric fields, the reduced ion mobilities of the ground and metastable states differ significantly. In particular, at room temperature the difference between the reduced ion mobilities of these states is larger than 11%, and therefore should be sufficiently large to ensure LRC of this ion. ",

    "abstract": "Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) [1] involves the capture of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) microcomb [2] tooth by a reference laser injected into the DKS resonator. This phase-locking behavior is described by an Adler equation whose analogous form describes numerous other physical systems [3], such as Josephson junctions [4]. We present an AC version of KIS whose behavior is similar to microwave-driven Josephson junctions, where periodic synchronization occurs as so-called Shapiro steps. We demonstrate consistent results in the AC-KIS dynamics predicted by the Adler model, Lugiato-Lefever equation, and experimental data from a chip-integrated microresonator system. The (integer) Shapiro steps in KIS can simply be explained as the sideband created through the reference laser phase modulation triggering the synchronization. Notably, our optical system allows for easy tuning of the Adler damping parameter, enabling the further observation of fractional-Shapiro steps, where the synchronization happens at a fraction of the driving microwave frequency. Here, we show that the comb tooth is indirectly captured thanks to a four-wave mixing Bragg-scattering process, leading to sub-comb mode-locking, and we demonstrate this experimentally through noise considerations. Our work opens the door to the study of synchronization phenomena in the context of microresonator frequency combs, synthesis of condensed-matter state analogues with DKSs, and the use of the fractional Shapiro steps for flexible and tunable access to the KIS regime.

    "abstract": "Conventionally, intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) is associated with phase vortices. However, our investigation into the propagation dynamics of 2D superimposed catastrophe beams, termed cyclone catastrophe beams (CCBs), reveals that these beams inherently exhibit rotation and possess OAM, distinct from the typical connection to phase vortices. Our observations clearly show these beams rotating during autofocusing propagation and particle manipulation, confirming the presence of OAM. Theoretical calculations affirm that the OAM of these beams is intrinsic and can be adjusted by varying the number of superimposed beams. Furthermore, our interference and phase studies indicate that, although CCBs exhibit phase vortices, they do not rotate around the singularities of phase vortices and their total topological charges are zero. This implies that the manifestation of OAM within CCBs does not rely on nonzero topological charge of the presented phase vortices within CCBs. Especially, eigenstates decomposition analysis illustrates that CCBs can be decomposed as a composite of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes with uneven fidelity, where the topological charges of LG modes align with multiples of the superimposed catastrophe beams but do not equal to the value of the OAM per photon within CCBs, emphasizing the intrinsic OAM within CCBs and the absence of a connection to phase vortices. Our findings not only advance the understanding of the relationship between OAM and phase vortices but also pave the way for different applications of OAM waves, catalyzing their development in optics and other domains.

Realization of these dual-comb compatible solitons in photonic integrated circuits remains a challenge. Here, we synthesized such CP solitons in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator and observed forced soliton oscillation due to rhythmic, time-varying soliton interactions. The interactions result in seconds mutual-coherence passively. Temporal motion in the soliton streams is discerned by measuring a quadratic-scaling frequency noise peaks and an inverse quadratic-scaling microcomb sidebands. By generating a CP soliton trimer to have two synchronized solitons in one of the orbiting directions, we resolve the incapability of measuring two unsynchronized CP soliton dimer pulses by optical cross-correlation, and show CP solitons undergo complex motion trajectory. We further prove that precise dual-comb spectroscopy with an acquisition time as short as 0.6 $\\mu$s is feasible using these solitons, although the temporal motion limits the dynamic range. Besides revealing soliton interactions with different group velocities, our work propels the realization of photonic integrated dual-comb spectrometers with high passive coherence. ",

To illustrate this idea, we analyze a dispersive spacetime crystal described by a Drude-Lorentz model with a travelingwave modulation. Our findings demonstrate that the interaction between positive and negative frequency bands can induce parametric instabilities under certain conditions, stemming from the interplay between dispersion and spacetime modulations. In particular, we find that material dispersion creates the conditions for the formation of instabilities for arbitrarily small modulations speeds in the absence of dissipative channels. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic Lanterns (PLs) are tapered waveguides that gradually transition from a multi-mode fiber geometry to a bundle of single-mode fibers (SMFs). They can efficiently couple multi-mode telescope light into a multi-mode fiber entrance at the focal plane and convert it into multiple single-mode beams. Thus, each SMF samples its unique mode (lantern principal mode) of the telescope light in the pupil, analogous to subapertures in aperture masking interferometry (AMI). Coherent imaging with PLs can be enabled by interfering SMF outputs and applying phase modulation, which can be achieved using a photonic chip beam combiner at the backend (e.g., the ABCD beam combiner). In this study, we investigate the potential of coherent imaging by interfering SMF outputs of a PL with a single telescope. We demonstrate that the visibilities that can be measured from a PL are mutual intensities incident on the pupil weighted by the cross-correlation of a pair of lantern modes. From numerically simulated lantern principal modes of a 6-port PL, we find that interferometric observables using a PL behave similarly to separated-aperture visibilities for simple models on small angular scales ($<\\lambda/D$) but with greater sensitivity to symmetries and capability to break phase angle degeneracies. Furthermore, we present simulated observations with wavefront errors and compare them to AMI. Despite the redundancy caused by extended lantern principal modes, spatial filtering offers stability to wavefront errors. Our simulated observations suggest that PLs may offer significant benefits in the photon noise-limited regime and in resolving small angular scales at low contrast regime. ",

    "title": "Path integral Lindblad master equation through transfer tensor method &  the generalized quantum master equation",
    "abstract": "Path integrals have, over the years, proven to be an extremely versatile tool for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. The initial limitations of applicability of these methods in terms of the size of the system has steadily been overcome through various developments, making numerical explorations of large systems a more-or-less regular feature. However, these simulations necessitate a detailed description of the system-environment interaction through accurate spectral densities, which are often difficult to obtain. Additionally, for several processes, such as spontaneous emission, one only has access to a rough estimation of an empirical timescale, and it is not possible to really define a proper spectral density at all. In this communication, an approach of incorporating such processes within an exact path integral description of other dissipative modes is developed through the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equations. This method will allow for a numerically exact non-perturbative inclusion of the degrees of freedom that are properly described by a bath using path integrals, while incorporating the empirical time scale through the Lindblad master equation. The cost of this approach is dominated by the cost of the path integral method used, and the impact of the Lindbladian terms is effectively obtained for free. This path integral Lindblad dynamics method is demonstrated with the example of electronic excitation transfer in a 4-site model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex with the exciton has a propensity of being \"lost\" to the charge transfer state at the third chromophore. The impact of different time-scales of abstraction of the exciton is illustrated at no extra cost. ",
