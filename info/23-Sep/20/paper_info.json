    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of electro-optic modulators, optical computing has become a potential excellent candidate for various computing tasks. New structures and devices for optical computing are emerging one after another, but the computing method is still the optical vector-matrix multiplication method that was decades ago. Here, we propose a novel optical computing paradigm that can parallelly implement matrix-matrix multiplication operation, which can directly replace existing vector-matrix multiplication, greatly improving computational efficiency. This preprint presents theoretical analysis, and we will supplement experimental results and conclusions in the future. ",

    "title": "OPUS: An Integrated Assessment Model for Satellites and Orbital Debris",
    "abstract": "An increasingly salient public policy challenge is how to manage the growing number of satellites in orbit, including large constellations. Many policy initiatives have been proposed that attempt to address the problem from different angles, but there is a paucity of analytical tools to help policymakers evaluate the efficacy of these different proposals and any potential counterproductive outcomes. To help address this problem, this paper summarizes work done to develop an experimental integrated assessment model -- Orbital Debris Propagators Unified with Economic Systems (OPUS) -- that combines both astrodynamics of the orbital population and economic behavior of space actors. For a given set of parameters, the model first utilizes a given astrodynamic propagator to assess the state of objects in orbit. It then uses a set of user-defined economic and policy parameters -- e.g. launch prices, disposal regulations -- to model how actors will respond to the economic incentives created by a given scenario. For the purposes of testing, the MIT Orbital Capacity Tool (MOCAT) version 4S was used as the primary astrodynamics propagator to simulate the true expected target collision probability ($p_c$) for a given end-of-life (EOL) disposal plan. To demonstrate propagator-agnosticism, a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GMPHD) filter was also used to simulate $p_c$. We also explore economic policy instruments to improve both sustainability of and economic welfare from orbit use. In doing so, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach can serve as a useful tool for evaluating policy proposals for managing orbital congestion. We also discuss areas where this work can be made more robust and expanded to include additional policy considerations. ",

We also built our own 2.7 kelvins cryogenic system for radio-wave assisted optical spectroscopy. We attained to high resolution and sensitivity both in pump-probe saturation spectroscopy and Raman heterodyne spectroscopy. The first one gave a high resolution spectrum of hyperfine structure, and the second one enabled to detect paramagnetic spin resonance efficiently for wide ranges of radio-frequency. As the Raman heterodyne process of our interest is the up-conversion of transductions, we made efforts at optimizing sensitivity of Raman heterodyne detections with selecting the best crystal orientation and with efficient radio-wave coupling for future applications toward photon transducer.

Here we show how a single layer of atoms in an array can undergo nonlinear amplification of fluctuations, leading to the formation of intricate optical patterns. The origin of the patterns is intrinsically cooperative, eliminating the necessity of mirrors or cavities, although introduction of a mirror in the vicinity of the atoms significantly modifies the scattering profiles. The emergence of these optical patterns is tied to a bistable collective response, which can be qualitatively described by a long-wavelength approximation, similar to a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation of optical Kerr media or ring cavities. These collective excitations have the ability to form singular defects and unveil atomic position fluctuations through wave-like distortions. ",

Thanks to the erbium-ytterbium co-doping providing high optical gain, the ultra-low loss nanostructuring, and the excitation of high-Q coherent polygon modes which suppresses multi-mode lasing and allows high spatial mode overlap factor between pump and lasing modes, single-mode laser emission operating at 1530 nm wavelength was observed with an ultra-low threshold, under 980-nm-band optical pump. The threshold was measured as low as 1 uW, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the best results previously reported in single-mode active TFLN microlasers.

    "abstract": "GeSn is nowadays recognized as a promising candidate to enable monolithic on-chip Si photonics operating in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. The addition of Sn to the Ge lattice induces a red-shift in the material bandgap, extending the absorption cut-off wavelength towards the infrared. In addition, above 7-9 at.% Sn, the GeSn alloy acquires a direct bandgap, enabling its use as active material in SWIR light-emitting devices. Ge-rich GeSn alloys have been demonstrated in a plethora of optoelectronic devices including photodetectors, lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Furthermore, the high theoretical mobility of GeSn motivated research for GeSn high-mobility field-effect transistors (FETs), while the possibility of monolithic integration on Si platforms has also pushed the investigation of GeSn for on-chip thermoelectric applications. However, despite more than 15 years of intensive research in the field, there exists no commercial device to date based on GeSn. In fact, there are numerous challenges hindering the rise of this material for the next-generation (opto)electronics. Here, we give a concise review of the historical achievements in GeSn research and the withstanding challenges. This is followed by a detailed description of the GeSn physical properties relevant for its use in optoelectronic devices. We conclude with a discussion of the open questions in the field. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of convergent shock compression in the solid wire targets irradiated by an ultra-fast relativistic laser pulse. Our Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations and coupled hydrodynamic simulations reveal that the compression process is initiated by both magnetic pressure and surface ablation associated with a strong transient surface return current with the density in the order of 1e17 A/m^2 and a lifetime of 100 fs. The results show that the dominant compression mechanism is governed by the plasma $\\beta$, i.e., the ratio of the thermal pressure to magnetic pressure. For small radii and low atomic number Z wire targets, the magnetic pressure is the dominant shock compression mechanism. As the target radius and atomic number Z increase, the surface ablation pressure is the main mechanism to generate convergent shocks based on the scaling law. Furthermore, the indirect experimental indication of the shocked hydrogen compression is provided by measuring the evolution of plasma expansion diameter via optical shadowgraphy. This work could offer a novel platform to generate extremely high pressures exceeding Gbar to study high-pressure physics using femtosecond J-level laser pulses, offering an alternative to the nanosecond kJ laser pulse-initiated and pulse power Z-pinch compression methods.

However, the aspherical shape of an OAPM creates significant geometric aberrations that make achieving diffraction-limited performance a challenge, and which lowers the peak electric field strength in the focal plane. Here we quantify the impact of geometric aberrations on the performance of the most widely-used spectrometer designs, by investigating whether diffraction-limited performance can be achieved in both the sample and the detector plane. We identify simple rules, based on marginal ray propagation, that allow spectrometers to be designed that are more robust to misalignment errors, and which have minimal aberrations for THz beams. For a given source this allows the design of optical paths that give the smallest THz beam focal spot, with the highest THz electric field strength possible. This is desirable for improved THz imaging, for better signal-to-noise ratios in linear THz spectroscopy and optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, and to achieve higher electric field strengths in non-linear THz spectroscopy.

It specifically explores the extent to which the Ernst angle, an optimal flip angle, optimizes image quality under different imaging parameters. The investigation begins with a theoretical derivation of the Ernst angle, assuming steady state imaging conditions. Then multiple studies that examine the effect of flip angle on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a key indicator of image quality, in different areas of the human body (blood, liver, and brain), are analysed. The study compares the results of these studies and compares their respective optimal flip angles with the Ernst angle. The findings reveal that flip angle plays a crucial role in enhancing SNR and image quality. However, the Ernst angle only optimizes SNR under steady state conditions and when using a spoiled gradient echo (GRE) sequence. Therefore, further investigations are necessary to determine the optimal flip angle under different imaging conditions to optimize SNR and enhance overall image quality. ",

Phonon-drag contribution, which arises from the momentum transfer between out-of-equilibrium phonon populations and charge carriers, significantly enhances the thermoelectric coefficient. Our implementation of the phonon drag term accounts for the anisotropy of nanostructures, such as thin films and nanowires, through the boundary- and momentum-resolved phonon lifetime. Our approach also takes into account the spin-orbit coupling which turns out to be crucial for hole transport. We reliably quantify the phonon drag contribution at various doping levels, temperatures, and nanostructure geometries for both electrons and holes in silicon nanostructures. Our results support the recent experimental findings, showing that a part of phonon drag contribution survives in 100 nm silicon nanostructures. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is a way to protect quantum information against noise. It consists of encoding input information into entangled quantum states known as the code space. Furthermore, to classify if the encoded information is corrupted or intact, a step known as syndrome detection is performed. For stabilizer codes, this step consists of measuring a set of stabilizer operators. In this paper, inspired by the QEC approach, and specifically stabilizer codes, we propose a prototype quantum circuit model for classification of classical data. The core quantum circuit can be considered as a \\emph{quantum perceptron} where the classification is based on syndrome detection. In this proposal, a quantum perceptron is realized by one stabilizer as part of a stabilizer code, while a quantum neural network (QNN) layer is realized by a stabilizer code which consists of many stabilizers. The concatenation of stabilizer codes results in complex QNNs. The QNN is trained by performing measurements and optimization of a set of parameterized stabilizers. We demonstrate the concept numerically. In this paper we also consider the first challenge to most applications of quantum computers, including data classification, which is to load data into the memory of the quantum computer. This loading amounts to representing the data as a quantum state, i.e., quantum state preparation. An exact amplitude encoding algorithm requires a circuit of exponential depth. We introduce an alternative recursive algorithm which approximates amplitude encoding with only a polynomial number of elementary gates. We name it recursive approximate-scheme algorithm (RASA). ",

A promising route to scalability is photonic measurement-based quantum computation, where single-qubit measurements on large cluster states, together with feedforward, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, generating large cluster states at high rates is notoriously difficult, as detection probabilities drop exponentially with the number of photons comprising the state. We tackle this challenge by encoding multiple qubits on each photon through high-dimensional spatial encoding, generating cluster states with over nine qubits at a rate of 100Hz. Additionally, we demonstrate that high-dimensional encoding substantially reduces the computation duration by enabling instantaneous feedforward between qubits encoded in the same photon. Our findings pave the way for resource-efficient measurement-based quantum computation using high-dimensional entanglement. ",
