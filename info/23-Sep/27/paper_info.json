    "abstract": "On-chip photodetectors are essential components in optical communications as they convert light into an electrical signal. Photobolometers are type of photodetector that functions through a resistance change caused by electronic temperature fluctuations upon light absorption. They are widely used in the broad wavelength range from UV to MIR and can operate on a wide material platform. In this work, I introduce a novel waveguide-integrated bolometer that operates in a wide wavelength range from NIR to MIR on the standard material platform with the transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) as the active material. This material platform enables the construction of both modulators and photodetectors using the same material, which is fully CMOS compatible and easily integrated with passive on-chip components. The photobolometers proposed here consist of a thin TCO layer placed inside the rib photonic waveguide to enhance light absorption and then heat the electrons in the TCO to temperatures above 1000 K. This rise in electron temperature leads to decreasing electron mobility and consequential electrical resistance change. In consequence, a responsivity exceeding 10 A/W can be attained with a mere few microwatts of optical input power. Calculations suggest that further improvements can be expected with lower doping of the TCO, thus opening new doors in on-chip photodetectors. ",

    "abstract": "Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) achieves superresolution in fluorescence imaging through patterned illumination and computational image reconstruction, yet current methods require bulky, costly modulation optics and high-precision optical alignment. This work demonstrates how nano-optical metasurfaces, rationally designed to tailor the optical wavefront at sub-wavelength dimensions, hold great potential as ultrathin, single-surface, all-optical wavefront modulators for SIM. We computationally demonstrate this principle with a multipolar-resonant metasurface composed of silicon nanostructures which generate versatile optical wavefronts in the far field upon variation of the polarization or angle of incident light. Algorithmic optimization is performed to identify the seven most suitable illumination patterns for SIM generated by the metasurface based on three key criteria. We find that multipolar-resonant metasurface SIM (mrm-SIM) achieves resolution comparable to conventional methods by applying the seven optimal metasurface-generated wavefronts to simulated fluorescent objects and reconstructing the objects using proximal gradient descent. The work presented here paves the way for a metasurface-enabled experimental simplification of structured illumination microscopy. ",

In hydrodynamics, the one-dimensional theory of the run-up of non-linear waves on a flat slope has gained great popularity, within which rigorous analytical results have been obtained in the class of non-breaking waves. In general, the result depends on the characteristics of the wave approaching (or generated on) the slope, which is usually not known in the measurements. Here we describe a rigorous method for recovering the initial displacement in a source localised in an inclined power-shaped channel from the characteristics of a moving shoreline. The method uses the generalised Carrier-Greenspan transformation, which allows one-dimensional non-linear shallow-water equations to be reduced to linear ones. The solution is found in terms of Erd\\'elyi-Kober integral operator. Numerical verification of our results is presented for the cases of a parabolic bay and an infinite plane beach. ",

Nonetheless, they start to encounter a limited degree of freedom in CGH optimization and physical constraints stemming from the coherent nature of holograms. To surpass the physical limitations, we consider polarization as a new degree of freedom by utilizing a novel optical platform called metasurface. Polarization-multiplexing metasurfaces enable incoherent-like behavior in holographic displays due to the mutual incoherence of orthogonal polarization states. We leverage this unique characteristic of a metasurface by integrating it into a holographic display and exploiting polarization diversity to bring an additional degree of freedom for CGH algorithms. To minimize the speckle noise while maximizing the image quality, we devise a fully differentiable optimization pipeline by taking into account the metasurface proxy model, thereby jointly optimizing spatial light modulator phase patterns and geometric parameters of metasurface nanostructures. We evaluate the metasurface-enabled depolarized holography through simulations and experiments, demonstrating its ability to reduce speckle noise and enhance image quality. ",

Thus, this paper studies the in-band co-polarization scattering beam scanning of antenna arrays. Firstly, the regulation method of antenna scattering is analyzed theoretically, concluding that the amplitude and phase of the antenna's scattering field can be regulated by changing the load impedance. Subsequently, PIN diodes are implemented to control the load impedance of the antenna. Consequently, the scattering of the antenna, ensuring that the antenna's scattering meets the condition of equal amplitude and a phase difference of 180{\\deg} when the PIN diode switches, thereby realizing scattering beam scanning. Moreover, by introducing an additional pre-phase, the inherent symmetric dual-beam issue observed in traditional 1-bit reconfigurable structures is overcome, achieving single-beam scanning of the scattering. Finally, a 1{\\times}16 linear antenna array is designed and fabricated, which operates at 6 GHz with radiation gain of 16.3 dBi. The scattering beams of the designed array can point to arbitrary angles within 45{\\deg}, significantly reducing the in-band co-polarization backward radar cross section.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous emission and internal conversion rates are calculated within harmonic approximations and compared to results obtained within the semi-classical extended thawed Gaussian approximation. This is the first application of the ETGA in the calculation of internal conversion and emission rates for real molecular systems, namely formaldehyde, fluorobenzene, azulene and a dicyano-squaraine dye. The viability of the models as black-box tools for prediction of spontaneous emission and internal conversion rates is assessed. All calculations were done using a consistent protocol in order to investigate how different methods perform without previous experimental knowledge. Contrasting the results with experimental data shows that there are further improvements required before theoretical predictions of emission and internal conversion rates can be used as reliable indicator for the photo-luminescence properties of molecules. We find that the extended thawed Gaussian approximation performs rather similar to the vertical harmonical model. Including anharmonicities in the calculation of internal conversion rates has a moderate effect on the quantitative results in the studied systems. The electronic structure calculations were done using the B3LYP, PBE0, $\\omega$B97XD and CAM-B3LYP functionals. The choice of the functional does not appear to be a major limiting factor for a black-box approach, when it comes to the prediction of radiative and nonradiative rates for organic molecules. The emission rates are fairly stable with respect to computational parameters, but the internal conversion rate reveals itself to be highly dependent on the choice of the spectral lineshape function, particularly the width of the Lorentzian function, associated with homogeneous broadening.

In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the QD position accuracy, obtained using two marker-based QD positioning techniques, photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, as well as using a marker-free in-situ electron beam lithography (in-situ EBL) technique. We employ four PL imaging configurations with three different image processing approaches and compare them with CL imaging. We fabricate circular mesa structures based on the obtained QD coordinates from both PL and CL image processing to evaluate the final positioning accuracy. This yields final position offset of the QD relative to the mesa center of $\\mu_x$ = (-40$\\pm$58) nm and $\\mu_y$ = (-39$\\pm$85) nm with PL imaging and $\\mu_x$ = (-39$\\pm$30) nm and $\\mu_y$ = (25$\\pm$77) nm with CL imaging, which are comparable to the offset $\\mu_x$ = (20$\\pm$40) nm and $\\mu_y$ = (-14$\\pm$39) nm obtained using the in-situ EBL method.

They can be structured and combined to form heterostructures that expand the realm of possibility to manipulate light interactions at the nanoscale. Appropriate and numerically efficient models accounting for the high intrinsic anisotropy of 2D materials and heterostructures are needed. In this article, we retrieve the relevant intrinsic parameters that describe the optical response of a homogeneous 2D material from a microscopic approach. Well-known effective models for vertical heterostructure (stacking of different layers) are retrieved. We found that the effective optical response model of horizontal heterostructures (alternating nano-ribbons) depends of the thickness. In the thin layer model, well adapted for 2D materials, a counter-intuitive in-plane isotropic behavior is predicted. We confront the effective model formulation with exact reference calculations such as ab-initio calculations for graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), as well as corrugated graphene with larger thickness but also with classical electrodynamics calculations that exactly account for the lateral structuration.

    "abstract": "Repulsive short-range and attractive long-range van der Waals (vdW) forces have an appreciable role in the behavior of extended molecular systems. When using empirical force fields - the most popular computational methods applied to such systems - vdW forces are typically described by Lennard-Jones-like potentials, which unfortunately have a limited predictive power. Here, we present a universal parameterization of a quantum-mechanical vdW potential, which requires only two free-atom properties - the static dipole polarizability $\\alpha_1$ and the dipole-dipole $C_6$ dispersion coefficient. This is achieved by deriving the functional form of the potential from the quantum Drude oscillator (QDO) model, employing scaling laws for the equilibrium distance and the binding energy as well as applying the microscopic law of corresponding states. The vdW-QDO potential is shown to be accurate for vdW binding energy curves, as demonstrated by comparing to ab initio binding curves of 21 noble-gas dimers. The functional form of the vdW-QDO potential has the correct asymptotic behavior both at zero and infinite distances. In addition, it is shown that the damped vdW-QDO potential can accurately describe vdW interactions in dimers consisting of group II elements. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the atom-in-molecule vdW-QDO model for predicting accurate dispersion energies for molecular systems. The present work makes an important step towards constructing universal vdW potentials, which could benefit (bio)molecular computational studies. ",

    "abstract": "We study the origin of dichroic effects in elastic scattering of high energy electrons by hydrogen atoms in the presence of a two-color bicircular laser field of commensurate frequencies, in the domain of moderate intensities below 10 TW/cm2 . We use a semiperturbative approach in which the interaction of the hydrogen atom with the laser field is treated in second-order perturbation theory, while the interaction of the projectile electron with the laser field is described by Gordon- Volkov wave functions. An analytical formula of circular dichroism in the angular distribution of scattered electrons is derived in the weak-field domain for a two-color laser field that is a combination of the fundamental and its third harmonic. A comparison between the two-photon differential cross sections for two-color co- and counterrotating circularly polarized laser fields is made and the effect of the intensity ratio of the monochromatic field components on the circular dichroism is investigated. The dichroic effect in the angular distribution of scattered electrons for two-photon absorption is analyzed as a function of the scattering and azimuthal angles. We show that the two-color bicircular laser field can induce a strong circular dichroism in the angular distribution of scattered electrons at small scattering angles where the atomic dressing effects are important, as well at larger scattering angles. At small scattering angles we demonstrate that the dichroic effect for two-photon transitions can be predicted under the following conditions: the scattering process is treated in fist-order Born approximation and the dressing of the atomic states by the laser field is carried out at least in first-order time-dependent perturbation theory.

    "abstract": "In ski jumping, low repetition rates of jumps limit the effectiveness of training. Thus, increasing learning rate within every single jump is key to success. A critical element of athlete training is motor learning, which has been shown to be accelerated by feedback methods. In particular, a fine-grained control of the center of gravity in the in-run is essential. This is because the actual takeoff occurs within a blink of an eye ($\\sim$300ms), thus any unbalanced body posture during the in-run will affect flight. This paper presents a smart, compact, and energy-efficient wireless sensor system for real-time performance analysis and biofeedback during ski jumping. The system operates by gauging foot pressures at three distinct points on the insoles of the ski boot at 100Hz. Foot pressure data can either be directly sent to coaches to improve their feedback, or fed into a ML model to give athletes instantaneous in-action feedback using a vibration motor in the ski boot. In the biofeedback scenario, foot pressures act as input variables for an optimized XGBoost model. We achieve a high predictive accuracy of 92.7% for center of mass predictions (dorsal shift, neutral stand, ventral shift). Subsequently, we parallelized and fine-tuned our XGBoost model for a RISC-V based low power parallel processor (GAP9), based on the PULP architecture. We demonstrate real-time detection and feedback (0.0109ms/inference) using our on-chip deployment. The proposed smart system is unobtrusive with a slim form factor (13mm baseboard, 3.2mm antenna) and a lightweight build (26g). Power consumption analysis reveals that the system's energy-efficient design enables sustained operation over multiple days (up to 300 hours) without requiring recharge. ",

Simulated amplifier gain is 15 dB at 450 MHz with a high-impedance (~5 kOhm signal source and standard 50-Ohm output. ",

    "abstract": "We compare the strong part of the $\\bar{\\hbox{N}}\\hbox{N}$ interaction obtained by the Nijmegen partial wave analysis and the results of some of the most popular $\\bar{\\hbox{N}}\\hbox{N}$ optical potentials in configuration space. We have found severe discrepancies in most of the partial waves, especially above $p_{Lab}$=400 MeV/c where the partial wave analysis displays a resonant-like structure in the $^{31}$S$_0$ and $^{33}$P$_0$ waves. Some theoretical difficulties to interpret this behaviour in terms of dynamical resonances are pointed pout and an alternative explanation is suggested. A much better stability is observed in the low energy parameters, apart from some discrepancies due to the presence of near-threshold quasi-bound states in particular waves. Large deviations have also been found between the corresponding potentials, at short and medium-range ($r\\gtrsim 1$ fm) distances. ",
