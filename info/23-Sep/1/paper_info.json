    "title": "Frequency Dependence of Subsurface Flaws Detection Efficiency via The  Total Internal Reflection Ultrasonic Sensor",
    "abstract": "The Total Internal Reflection Ultrasonic Sensor (TIRUS) is a device especially aimed at detecting subsurface flaws in a tested specimen based on the frustrated total internal reflection of bulk ultrasonic waves in the sensor body [1]. In the fabricated experimental sample of the TIRUS a transducer of the sensor emitted a slow shear wave with the velocity ~600 m/s (SSW) into the [110] direction of the TeO2 crystal (Fig. 1) [2]. The sensor design was such that the displacement vector of the SSW lay in the planes of reflecting surfaces of the crystal, that is, it was a shear horizontal (SH) wave with respect to these planes. It was assumed that with such a design no other waves should exist in the crystal except those polarized as the SSW [3]. The total internal reflection of a probing ultrasonic wave incident at the interface between the sensor and a tested object is frustrated if there is a subsurface flaw in the evanescent field under the interface (Fig. 1, a). As a result, the reflected wave is affected, and the sensor output changes. ",

    "title": "Testing Models of 'Gravity' Using a Quantum Computer",
    "abstract": "This article begins by putting forth a model that shows how the storage and retrieval of information on a wave function that involves quantum entanglement behaves similarly to the concepts of length contraction and time dilation, respectively. An exploration is then made to see if another model can be generated based on the one previously mentioned that guides the time evolution of a quantum system in a manner similar to that of gravity. The answer is made in the affirmative, after testing a series of models, by producing a field that is mediated solely by the transfer of quantum information using both quantum entanglement and wave function collapse. While it is readily acknowledged that the effective field produced may not be gravity, the study provides arguments about why the concepts presented do in fact provide fundamental insights about the true nature of gravity as opposed to merely generating similar behavior to gravity. The study moves on to study how a system with uniform effective potential behaves similarly to dark energy, albeit with a system whose construction is severely limited by computational resources. Finally, an exploration is made as to whether a negative gravitational mass can be produced. It is found that while an isolated particle with negative gravitational mass proves to be problematic according to this model, it seems as though a local region with negative gravitational mass can be produced as long as the resulting fields are cancelled out at larger distances.

    "abstract": "There must exist a reformulation of quantum field theory, even at low energies, which does not depend on classical time. The octonionic theory proposes such a reformulation, leading to a pre-quantum pre-spacetime theory. The ingredients for constructing such a theory, which is also a unification of the standard model with gravitation, are : (i) the pre-quantum theory of trace dynamics: a matrix-valued Lagrangian dynamics, (ii) the spectral action principle of non-commutative geometry, (iii) the number system known as the octonions, for constructing a non-commutative manifold and for defining elementary particles via Clifford algebras, (iv) a Lagrangian with $E_8 \\times E_8$ symmetry. The split bioctonions define a sixteen dimensional space (with left-right symmetry) whose geometry (evolving in Connes time) relates to the four known fundamental forces, while predicting two new forces, $SU(3)_{grav}$ and $U(1)_{grav}$. This latter interaction is possibly the theoretical origin of MOND. Coupling constants of the standard model result from left-right symmetry breaking, and their values are theoretically determined by the characteristic equation of the exceptional Jordan algebra of the octonions. The quantum-to-classical transition, precipitated by the entanglement of a critical number of fermions, is responsible for the emergence of classical spacetime, and also for the familiar formulation of quantum theory on a spacetime background.

    "abstract": "Low driving voltage (Vpp), high-speed silicon microring modulator plays a critical role in energy-efficient optical interconnect and optical computing systems owing to its ultra-compact footprint and capability for on-chip wavelength-division multiplexing. However, existing silicon microring modulators usually require more than 2 V of Vpp, which is limited by the relatively weak plasma dispersion effect of silicon and the small capacitance density of the reversed PN-junction. Here we present a highly efficient metal-oxide semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP) microring modulator through heterogeneous integration between silicon photonics and titanium-doped indium oxide, which is a high-mobility transparent conductive oxide (TCO) material with a strong plasma dispersion effect. The device is co-fabricated by Intel's photonics fab and TCO patterning processes at Oregon State University, which exhibits a high electro-optic modulation efficiency of 117 pm/V with a low VpiL of 0.12 Vcm, and consequently can be driven by an extremely low Vpp of 0.8 V. At a 11 GHz modulation bandwidth where the modulator is limited by the high parasitic capacitance, we obtained 25 Gb/s clear eye diagrams with energy efficiency of 53 fJ/bit and demonstrated 35 Gb/s open eyes with a higher driving voltage. Further optimization of the device is expected to increase the modulation bandwidth up to 52 GHz that can encode data at 100 Gb/s for next-generation, energy-efficient optical communication and computation with sub-volt driving voltage without using any high voltage swing amplifier.

It consists of an array of 48 electrostatic Einzel lenses distributed along a polar grid with 12-fold rotational symmetry.

The experimental phase plate behavior is characterized by a Gerchberg-Saxton phase reconstruction algorithm, showing a phase sensitivity of 0.075 rad/mV at 300 keV, with a phase resolution of approximately 3$\\cdot$10$^{-3}~\\pi$. The performance of the phase plate is demonstrated by preparing a series of orthogonal quantum states with specific intensity profiles.

    "abstract": "In recent years, particle discrimination methods based on digital waveform analysis techniques for neutron-transmutation-doped silicon (nTD-Si) detectors have become widely used for the identification of low-energy charged particles. Although the particle discrimination capability of this method has been well demonstrated for small incident angles, the particle discrimination performance may be affected by changes in the detector response when the detector is moved closer to the charged particle source and the incident position distribution and incident angle distribution to the detector become wide. In this study, we performed a beam test for particle discrimination in light-charged ($Z \\le 2$) particles using the digital waveform analysis method with a pad-type nTD-Si detector and investigated the dependence of the performance of the particle discrimination on the incident position and incident angle. As the incident angle increased, a decrease in the maximum current was observed, which was sufficient to affect the performance of the particle discrimination. This decrease can be expressed as a function of the penetration depth of the charged particles into the detector, which varies for each nuclide. ",

Its creation typically relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulky nonlinear crystals where the tunability of spatial entanglement is limited. Here, we predict that ultrathin nonlinear lithium niobate metasurfaces can generate and diversely tune spatially entangled photon pairs. The spatial properties of photons including the emission pattern, rate, and degree of spatial entanglement are analysed theoretically with the coupled mode theory and Schmidt decomposition method. We show that by leveraging the strong angular dispersion of the metasurface, the degree of spatial entanglement quantified by the Schmidt number can be decreased or increased by changing the pump laser wavelength and a Gaussian beam size. This flexibility can facilitate diverse quantum applications of entangled photon states generated from nonlinear metasurfaces. ",

Here, we introduce a novel multi-scale approach to simulate the nonlinear optical response of molecular nanomaterials combining ab initio quantum-chemical and classical Maxwell-scattering computations. In this approach, the first hyperpolarizability tensor is computed with time-dependent density-functional theory and translated into a multi-scattering formalism that considers the optical interaction between neighboring molecules. A novel object is introduce to perform this transition from quantum-chemistry to classical scattering theory: the Hyper-Transition(T)-matrix. With this object at hand, the nonlinear optical response from single molecules and also from entire photonic devices can be computed, incorporating the full tensorial and dispersive nature of the optical response of the molecules. To demonstrate the applicability of our novel approach, the generation of a second-harmonic signal from a thin film of a Urea molecular crystal is computed and compared to more traditional simulations. Furthermore, an optical cavity is designed, which enhances the second-harmonic response of the molecular film by more than two orders of magnitude. Our approach is highly versatile and accurate and can be the working horse for the future exploration of nonlinear photonic molecular materials in structured photonic environments. ",

We first consider the radiation from the energetic electrons exiting the backside of the target. Our kinetic model takes account of the coherent transition radiation due to these electrons crossing the plasma-vacuum interface as well as of the synchrotron radiation due to their deflection and deceleration in the sheath field they set up in vacuum. After showing that both mechanisms tend to largely compensate each other when all the electrons are pulled back into the target, we investigate the scaling of the net radiation with the sheath field strength. We then demonstrate the sensitivity of this radiation to a percent-level fraction of escaping electrons. We also study the influence of the target thickness and laser focusing. The same sheath field that confines most of the fast electrons around the target rapidly sets into motion the surface ions. We describe the THz emission from these accelerated ions and their accompanying hot electrons by means of a plasma expansion model that allows for finite foil size and multidimensional effects. Again, we explore the dependencies of this radiation mechanism on the laser-target parameters. Under conditions typical of current ultrashort laser-solid experiments, we find that the THz radiation from the expanding plasma is much less energetic -- by one to three orders of magnitude -- than that due to the early-time motion of the fast electrons.

We study an ultra-large-scale, quantum-accurate structural model containing a million atoms, and more than ten thousand defects, allowing reliable defect-related statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and machine-learned local atomic energies to develop a universal classification of the different types of defects in amorphous silicon. The results suggest a revision of the established floating-bond model by showing that fivefold-coordinated atoms in amorphous silicon exhibit a wide range of local environments, and it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for modelling and understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon alone.

    "title": "More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits",
    "abstract": "Quantum computation is the most promising new paradigm for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei. An atomistic problem in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology can be mapped to a representation on a (digital) quantum computer. Any such representation will be reduced dimensional as, for instance, accomplished by active-orbital-space approaches. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available on a quantum computer) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian ($H$), which allows us to take advantage of an underlying structure that $H$ might have. For multireference perturbation theory, we exploit that $H$ is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. Moreover, our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). Here, we use the fact that $H$ is the sum of two commuting monomer Hamiltonians, which makes it possible to calculate the full second-order energy correction of SAPT while only having access to the state of one of the monomers at a time. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory. ",
