    "abstract": "Driven in large part by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, quantum information science (QIS) coursework and degree programs are rapidly spreading across US institutions. Yet prior work suggests that access to quantum workforce education is inequitably distributed, disproportionately benefiting students at large research-focused institutions whose student bodies are unrepresentative of US higher education as a whole. We use regression analysis to analyze the distribution of QIS coursework across 456 institutions of higher learning as of fall 2022, identifying statistically significant disparities across institutions in particular along the axes of institution classification, funding, and geographic distribution. We also conduct a brief analysis of the distribution of emerging dedicated QIS degree programs. We conclude with a discussion of implications for educators, policymakers, and quantum workforce development initiatives. ",

Laser cooling to ultracold temperatures is an established technique for trapped diatomic and triatomic molecules. Further cooling of the molecules to near the motional ground state is crucial for reducing various dephasings in quantum and precision applications. In this work, we demonstrate Raman sideband cooling of CaF molecules in optical tweezers to near their motional ground state, with average motional occupation quantum numbers of $\\bar{n}_{x}=0.16(12)$, $\\bar{n}_{y}=0.17(17)$ (radial directions), $\\bar{n}_{z}=0.22(16)$ (axial direction) and a 3-D motional ground state probability of $54\\pm18\\%$.

We demonstrate a diamond phononic waveguide platform for generating, guiding, and detecting gigahertz-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) phonons.

A novel, hybrid method to reconstruct the laser field from fluence measurements in the transverse plane at multiple positions along the propagation axis is presented, combining a Hermite-Gauss modes decomposition and elements of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. The proposed Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm with modes decomposition (GSA-MD) takes into account the pointing instabilities of high intensity laser systems by tuning the centers of the HG modes. Furthermore, it quickly builds a field description by progressively increasing the number of modes and thus the accuracy of the field reconstruction. The results of field reconstruction using the GSA-MD are shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental measurements from two different high-peak power laser facilities. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field encompassing various disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer engineering, and computer science. Teaching quantum computing in a concise and effective manner can be challenging, especially within the time constraints of a single course or a short period, even for graduate students. This challenge is particularly relevant in two-year MSc programs that include a thesis, which is a typical structure in higher education systems in the USA and Europe. In this paper, the author proposes an approach to teaching quantum computing and shares their experience of conducting a course chapter on the subject within a two-week time frame. The experience reported in this paper is integrated into the \"Technologies of Computing Systems\" (TCS) course, with a total workload of 6 ECTS (in the context of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, one ECTS corresponds to 28 hours of work), conducted in one quarter, over seven weeks. The structure of the course chapter is discussed, involving a series of lectures that were accompanied by lab classes and a lab project, allowing students to receive guidance while also engaging in hands-on learning and independent study. The paper provides an overview of the quantum computing topics covered, and their integration in the TSC course, and gives details about how these topics are studied in the different types of classes. It also discusses the evaluation procedure and presents the results obtained. It can be concluded that the inclusion of the quantum computing component not only significantly increased student interest in the course but also effectively bridged the gap between classical and quantum computing for engineering students within a short period of two weeks.

    "abstract": "Heat is an inevitable outcome in energy consumption processes, as more than 65% of input energy is wasted as heat. If we can generate electricity from waste heat, it will help minimize the needs for fossil fuels in power plants and can reduce carbon emissions. One way to generate power from heat is through the use of thermophotovoltaics (TPVs), where photons radiated from thermal emitters are converted into electricity. To optimize TPV performance, it is crucial to design emitters such that their emissivity spectrum matches their operating temperature. For example, higher emissivity is needed at shorter (longer) wavelengths at higher (lower) temperatures. Thus, having the ability to create wavelength-selective emitters can enable TPV applications for a wider range of temperatures. This research focuses on utilizing metamaterials (2D emitters) and planar thin films (1D emitters) to create those emitters. Simulation, fabrication, material property analysis, and radiation measurements were used to characterize the emitters. Based on simulation, metamaterial emitters exhibit engineerable emissivity due to various mechanisms of their optical resonance. Also, large-area fabrication of 1D emitters (78 cm2) was achieved owing to their simple structure, which is required to produce higher TPV power output. Incorporating the characteristics of emitters of each type, their advantages and challenges are discussed. Therefore, the comprehensive results of this research help realize practical implementation of TPV applications. ",

The large difference in saturation magnetization of the two layers not only brings nonreciprocal spin waves (SWs), but also ensures the phonon-magnon (SAWs-SWs) coupling at relatively low wavenumbers. It is found that the angle between the magnetization and the wavevector play important roles in determining the strength of magnetoelastic coupling and nonreciprocity, simultaneously. A large nonreciprocal transmission of SAWs about 30 dB (i.e. 60 dB/mm) is demonstrated at 2.33 GHz. In addition, the dispersion relation between coupled SH-SAWs and nonreciprocal SWs is developed, which provide a good insight into the observed phenomena. Our results offer a convenient approach to implement nonreciprocal SAW isolators or circulators. ",

In this article, we demonstrate a low-noise infrared frequency comb with a repetition rate as low as 40 kHz using a Yb:KYW mode-locked laser, pulse picking, and subsequent amplification. The frequency comb structure is confirmed by generating a beat note with a continuous wave reference laser.

Here we show that the light can be effectively guided and trapped in the glided photonic crystal interfaces (GPCIs). The projected band gap of GPCIs, which depends on the glide parameter, is characterized by a Dirac mass. Interestingly, the GPCIs with zero Dirac mass is a glide-symmetric waveguide featured with excellent transmission performance even in the presence of sharp corners and disorders. Moreover, placing two GPCIs with opposite Dirac mass together results in a photonic bound state due to the Jackiw-Rebbi theory.

The magnetic state of the CuMnAs/GaAs is characterized by a multitude of submicron-sized domains which we image by x-ray magnetic linear dichroism combined with photoemission electron microscopy. Within the explored strain range, CuMnAs shows magnetoelastic effects in the form of N\\'eel vector waves with micrometer wavelength, which corresponds to an averaged overall spin-axis rotation up to 2.4 deg driven by the time-dependent strain from the surface acoustic wave. Measurements at different temperatures indicate a reduction of the wave amplitude when lowering the temperature. However, no domain wall motion has been detected on the nanosecond timescale ",

    "abstract": "Governed by the hairy ball theorem, classical antennas with isotropic responses to linearly polarized radio waves are unrealizable. This work shows that the antenna based on Rydberg atoms can theoretically achieve an ideal isotropic response to linearly polarized radio waves; that is, it has zero isotropic deviation. Experimental results of isotropic deviation within 5 dB, and 0.3 dB achievable after optimization, in microwave and terahertz wave measurements support the theory and are at least 15 dB improvement than the classical omnidirectional antenna. Combined with the SI traceable and ultrawideband property, the ideal isotropic response will make radio wave measurement based on atomic antenna much more accurate and reliable than the traditional method. This isotropic atomic antenna is an excellent example of what a tailored quantum sensor can realize, but a classical sensor cannot. It has crucial applications in fields such as radio wave electrometry. ",

A terahertz (THz) MFC, combining the advantages of the THz and MFC technologies, is highly desired because it would significantly advance the MFC applications in ultrafast magnonic metrology, sensing, and communications. Here, we show that the THz MFC can be generated by nonlinear interactions between spin waves and skyrmions in antiferromagnets [Z.

It is found that the strength of the three-wave mixing between propagating magnons and breathing skyrmions follows a linear dependence on the driving frequency and the MFC signal can be observed over a broad driving frequency range. Our results extend the working frequency of MFC to the THz regime, which would have potential applications in ultrafast spintronic devices and promote the development of nonlinear magnonics in antiferromagnets.

    "abstract": "Topological properties in quantum materials are often governed by symmetry and tuned by crystal structure and external fields, and hence symmetry-sensitive nonlinear optical measurements in a magnetic field are a valuable probe. Here we report nonlinear magneto-optical second harmonic generation (SHG) studies of non-magnetic topological materials including bilayer WTe2, monolayer WSe2 and bulk TaAs. The polarization-resolved patterns of optical SHG under magnetic field show nonlinear Kerr rotation in these time-reversal symmetric materials. For materials with three-fold rotational symmetric lattice structure, the SHG polarization pattern rotates just slightly in a magnetic field, whereas in those with mirror or two-fold rotational symmetry the SHG polarization pattern rotates greatly and distorts. These different magneto-SHG characters can be understood by considering the superposition of the magnetic field-induced time-noninvariant nonlinear optical tensor and the crystal-structure-based time-invariant counterpart. The situation is further clarified by scrutinizing the Faraday rotation, whose subtle interplay with crystal symmetry accounts for the diverse behavior of the extrinsic nonlinear Kerr rotation in different materials. Our work illustrates the application of magneto-SHG techniques to directly probe nontrivial topological properties, and underlines the importance of minimizing extrinsic nonlinear Kerr rotation in polarization-resolved magneto-optical studies.

    "abstract": "The use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) in imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes is expected to extend the observation times of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources, particularly within the highest energy domain of 50-300 TeV, where the Cherenkov signal from celestial gamma rays is adequate even under bright moonlight background conditions. Unlike conventional photomultiplier tubes, SiPMs do not exhibit quantum efficiency or gain degradation, which can be observed after long exposures to bright illumination. However, under bright conditions, the photon detection efficiency of a SiPM can be undergo temporary degradation because a fraction of its avalanche photodiode cells can saturate owing to photons from the night-sky background (NSB). In addition, the large current generated by the high NSB rate can increase the temperature of the silicon substrate, resulting in shifts in the SiPM breakdown voltages and consequent gain changes. Moreover, this large current changes the effective bias voltage because it causes a voltage drop across the protection resistor of 100-1000 {\\Omega}. Hence, these three factors, namely the avalanche photodiode (APD) saturation, Si temperature, and voltage drop must be carefully compensated for and/or considered in the energy calibration of Cherenkov telescopes with SiPM cameras. In this study, we measured the signal output charge of a SiPM and its variation as a function of different NSB-like background conditions up to 1 GHz/pixel. The results verify that the product of the SiPM gain and photon detection efficiency is well characterized by these three factors. ",

Recent experiments show that TMDC-PC hybrids can reach the strong-coupling limit between excitons and plasmons forming new quasiparticles, so-called plexcitons. To describe this coupling theoretically, we develop a self-consistent Maxwell-Bloch theory for TMDC-PC hybrid structures, which allows us to compute the scattered light in the near- and far-field explicitly and provide guidance for experimental studies. Our calculations reveal a spectral splitting signature of strong coupling of more than $100\\,$meV in gold-MoSe$_2$ structures with $30\\,$nm nanoparticles, manifesting in a hybridization of exciton and plasmon into two effective plexcitonic bands. In addition to the hybridized states, we find a remaining excitonic mode with significantly smaller coupling to the plasmonic near-field, emitting directly into the far-field. Thus, hybrid spectra in the strong coupling regime can contain three emission peaks. ",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the use of Feynman photon path integrals to compute the probability of detecting reflected, diffracted, and scattered photons at different points in space after interacting with conduction electrons. Five examples are given: (1) a thin parabolic sheet of conduction electrons (e.g. a metal mirror) that produces a sharp focus of a distant point source surrounded by the Airy diffraction pattern, (2) the loss of focusing power as the thickness of the parabolic sheet is increased and complete destructive interference for thicknesses that are an integer multiple of 1/2 the wavelength, (3) diffraction of photons entering a thin sheet from the side, (4) diffraction of photons entering the side of a sheet as its thickness is increased, and (5) the angular scattering distribution of internally generated photons in an extended volume of conduction electrons. The calculations integrated the complex probability amplitudes for photon paths from (a) a point source to (b) all points in the conduction electron volume and to (c) a point detector. At each detector position the detection probability was computed as the square of the absolute value of the integral. In general, if there is a concentration of paths that have nearly the same complex amplitude phase, reflection dominates. Otherwise, if the conduction electron volume has sharp boundaries, diffraction dominates. Isotropic scattering dominates for conduction electrons distributed throughout an extended volume, and may explain how scintillation photons in cryogenic n-type GaAs can escape total internal reflection trapping, which is essential for its high luminosity.

These hardware systems promise to speed up the computation significantly. In this work, we propose a new method to solve linear systems written as a binary optimization problem. The procedure solves the problem efficiently and allows it to handle large linear systems. Our approach is founded on the geometry of the original linear problem and resembles the gradient conjugate method. The conjugated directions used can significantly improve the algorithm's convergence rate. We also show that a partial knowledge of the intrinsic geometry of the problem can divide the original problem into independent sub-problems of smaller dimensions. These sub-problems can then be solved using quantum or classical solvers. Although determining the geometry of the problem has an additional computational cost, it can substantially improve the performance of our method compared to previous implementations. ",
