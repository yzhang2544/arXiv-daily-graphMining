    "title": "A contactless scanning near-field optical dilatometer imaging the  thermal expansivity of inhomogeneous 2D materials and thin films at the  nanoscale",
    "abstract": "To date, there are very few experimental techniques, if any, that are suitable for the purpose of acquiring, with nanoscale lateral resolution, quantitative maps of the thermal expansivity of 2D materials and thin films, despite huge demand for nanoscale thermal management, for example in designing integrated circuitry for power electronics. Besides, contactless analytical tools for determining the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) are highly desirable, because probes in contact with the sample significantly perturb any thermal measurements. Here, we introduce {\\omega}-2{\\omega} near-field thermoreflectance imaging, as an all-optical and contactless approach to map the TEC at the nanoscale with precision. Testing of our technique is performed on nanogranular films of gold and multilayer graphene (ML-G) platelets. Our method demonstrates that the TEC of Au is higher at the metal-insulator interface, with an average of (17.12 +/- 2.30)x10-6 K-1 in agreement with macroscopic techniques. For ML-G, the average TEC was (-5.77 +/- 3.79)x10-6 K-1 and is assigned to in-plane vibrational bending modes. A vibrational-thermal transition from graphene to graphite is observed, where the TEC becomes positive as the ML thickness increases. Our nanoscale method demonstrates results in excellent agreement with its macroscopic counterparts, as well as superior capabilities to probe 2D materials and interfaces. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous and monolithic integration of the versatile low loss silicon nitride platform with low temperature materials such as silicon electronics and photonics, III-V compound semiconductors, lithium niobate, organics, and glasses, has been inhibited by the need for high temperature annealing as well as the need for different processes for thin and thick waveguides. New techniques are needed to maintain the state-of-the-art losses, nonlinear properties, and CMOS compatible process while enabling this next level of 3D integration. We report a significant advance in silicon nitride integrated photonics, demonstrating the same anneal-free process, with a maximum temperature 250 {\\deg}C, for an order of magnitude range in nitride thickness without requiring stress mitigation and polishing, using inductively coupled plasma-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition with a deuterated silane precursor gas. We report 1.77 dB/m loss and 14.9 million Q for thin waveguides, over half an order magnitude lower loss than previous low temperature processes, and 8.66 dB/m loss and 4.03 million Q for thick nitride, the highest reported Q for a low temperature process with similar device area. Our thick nitride devices demonstrate anomalous dispersion and over two-octave supercontinuum generation, from 650 nm to 2.7 {\\mu}m, and four-wave mixing parametric gain of 15.2 mW/mm, the lowest threshold per unit resonator length for a low temperature process. These results represent a significant step towards a uniform ultra-low loss silicon nitride homogeneous and heterogenous platform for both thin and thick waveguides capable of linear and nonlinear photonic circuits and integration with low temperature materials and processes.

    "abstract": "Plasmonic optical nanoantennas offer compelling solutions for enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, until now, their focus has been mainly limited to the visible and near-infrared regions, overlooking the immense potential of the ultraviolet (UV) range, where molecules exhibit their strongest absorption. Here, we present the realization of UV resonant nanogap antennas constructed from paired rhodium nanocubes. Rhodium emerges as a robust alternative to aluminum, offering enhanced stability in wet environments and ensuring reliable performance in the UV range. Our results showcase the nanoantenna ability to enhance the UV autofluorescence of label-free streptavidin and hemoglobin proteins. We achieve significant enhancements of the autofluorescence brightness per protein by up to 120-fold, and reach zeptoliter detection volumes enabling UV autofluorescence correlation spectroscopy (UV-FCS) at high concentrations of several tens of micromolar. We investigate the modulation of fluorescence photokinetic rates and report excellent agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. This work expands the applicability of plasmonic nanoantennas into the deep UV range, unlocking the investigation of label-free proteins at physiological concentrations. ",

    "abstract": "In the development of locally resonant metamaterials, the physical resonator design is often omitted and replaced by an idealized mass-spring system. This paper presents a novel approach for designing multimodal resonant structures, which give rise to multi-bandgap metamaterials with predefined band gaps. Our method uses a conditional variational autoencoder to identify nontrivial patterns between design variables of complex-shaped resonators and their modal effective parameters. After training, the cost of generating designs satisfying arbitrary criteria - frequency and mass of multiple modes - becomes negligible. An example of a resonator family with six geometric variables and two targeted modes is further elaborated. We find that the autoencoder performs well even when trained with a limited dataset, resulting from a few hundred numerical modal analyses. The method generates several designs that very closely approximate the desired modal characteristics. The accuracy of the best designs, proposed by the auto-encoder, is confirmed in tests of 3D-printed resonator prototypes. Further experiments demonstrate the close agreement between the measured and desired dispersion relation of a sample metamaterial beam. ",

However, this route has remained poorly explored for the generation of few-cycle broadband THz transients due to the inadequacy of typically employed nonlinear crystals. Here, we demonstrate that thin lithium niobate crystals are a promising platform to circumvent current difficulties. Using a 50-um thin lithium niobate plate intracavity of a compact high-power mode-locked thin-disk laser, we generate broadband THz pulses with a spectrum extending up to 3 THz at 44.8 MHz repetition rate, driven by 264 W of intracavity average power. This approach opens the door to efficient high-power single-cycle THz generation at high repetition rates, scalable to kilowatt-level driving power with low cost and complexity. ",

To the best of our knowledge and for the first time, a novel graphene-assisted reprogrammable metasurface that offers the unprecedented capability to independently and concurrently manipulate EM waves within both half-spaces has been introduced in the THz frequency band.

    "abstract": "In this study, the first-of-its-kind use of active learning (AL) framework in thermal spray is adapted to improve the prediction accuracy of the in-flight particle characteristics and uses Gaussian Process (GP) ML model as a surrogate that generalises a global solution without necessarily involving physical mechanisms. The AL framework via the Bayesian Optimisation was utilised to: (a) reduce the maximum uncertainty in the given database and (b) reduce local uncertainty around a contrived test point. The initial dataset consists of 26 atmospheric plasma spray (APS) parameters of silicon, aimed at ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) for the next generation of aerospace applications. The maximum uncertainty in the initial dataset was reduced by AL-driven identification of search spaces and conducting six guided spray trails in the identified search spaces. On average, a 52.9% improvement (error reduction) of RMSE and an R2 increase of 8.5% were reported on the predicted in-flight particle velocities and temperatures after the AL-driven optimisation. Furthermore, the Bayesian Optimisation around a contrived test point to predict the best possible characteristics resulted in a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy as compared to the non-optimised prediction. These AL-guided experimental validations not only increase the informativeness of the limited dataset but is adaptable for other thermal spraying methods without necessarily involving physical mechanisms and underlying mechanisms. The use of AL-driven optimisation may drive the thermal spraying towards resource-efficiency and may serve as the first step towards fully digital thermal spraying environments. ",

    "abstract": "Flexible needle insertion procedures are common for minimally-invasive surgeries for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. Bevel-tip needles provide physicians the capability to steer the needle during long insertions to avoid vital anatomical structures in the patient and reduce post-operative patient discomfort. To provide needle placement feedback to the physician, sensors are embedded into needles for determining the real-time 3D shape of the needle during operation without needing to visualize the needle intra-operatively. Through expansive research in fiber optics, a plethora of bio-compatible, MRI-compatible, optical shape-sensors have been developed to provide real-time shape feedback, such as single-core and multicore fiber Bragg gratings. In this paper, we directly compare single-core fiber-based and multicore fiber-based needle shape-sensing through identically constructed, four-active area sensorized bevel-tip needles inserted into phantom and \\exvivo tissue on the same experimental platform. In this work, we found that for shape-sensing in phantom tissue, the two needles performed identically with a $p$-value of $0.164 > 0.05$, but in \\exvivo real tissue, the single-core fiber sensorized needle significantly outperformed the multicore fiber configuration with a $p$-value of $0.0005 < 0.05$. This paper also presents the experimental platform and method for directly comparing these optical shape sensors for the needle shape-sensing task, as well as provides direction, insight and required considerations for future work in constructively optimizing sensorized needles.

We consider a static electric field and an intense laser field nonresonant with the quantum structure, with variable intensities and orientations with respect to the symmetry axis of the quantum ring. In the formalism of the effective mass approximation for electrons and holes, the energies and wavefunctions were numerically computed using the finite element method implemented with an accurate three-dimensional model of the real quantum ring. Laser dressing of the confining potential was performed using the exact integration formula at each point. Our results show major differences between the effects of the two types of applied fields, caused mainly by the static electric-field-induced strong polarizability of the confined electron-hole pair. In addition, the effects of both fields exhibit strong anisotropy in the electronic properties as a result of the particular flattened geometry of the quantum ring. Proper combinations of field strengths and orientations are helpful in designing accurate tools for the sensitive manipulation of interband radiative properties. ",

    "abstract": "The complex classification of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that are captured in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and the constraint of their multiple origins are two significant open problems concerning the Solar System. The case-by-case study of the different MMRs and their characteristics provide information about their origin and dynamics, which helps us to understand the early stages of the Solar System evolution. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the detected TNOs close to a 3/1 MMR with Neptune. We initially use a semi-analytic three-body model to investigate the coplanar secular dynamics of these objects and find the stationary points. We then use surface sections and stability maps to analyse the non-averaged dynamics. These methods allow us to isolate the different stability regions and determine the extent of the chaotic regions. We show that stability maps are an extremely powerful tool for studying the resonant dynamics when they are computed in terms of the resonant angle. We then use these maps to study the non-planar three-body problem and the full dynamics in the presence of planetary perturbations. We confirm that TNOs near the 3/1 MMR regions can exist at very high inclinations. In the framework of the three-body problem, many of these objects can also be stable outside the 3/1 MMR owing to a Kozai secular resonance. However, when we take into account the perturbations of the four giant planets, the Kozai regions disappear and only the 3/1 MMR region remains, with eccentricities $e \\lesssim 0.5$. ",

The spaser system is pumped coherently and incoherently with the same excitation rate, and the characteristics of coherent localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode, thus produced, are compared for the two pumping scenarios. We provide a detailed analytical expression for the steady state and show that the incoherent pump is more suitable for the continuous spaser mode. The reason is better understood by studying the temporal evolution of number of LSP (N_n ), where the oscillation of LSP starts early for incoherent drive and relaxes to steady state with a large value of N_n. At a large pump rate, spaser curve shows saturation. In addition, we have found that the resonance peak of spaser field is independent of coherent as well as incoherent pumping, while the peak amplitude of field depends on the pump rate. ",
