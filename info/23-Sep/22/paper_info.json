    "abstract": "The task of providing effective instruction and facilitating comprehension of resources is a substantial difficulty in the field of Quantum Computing, mostly attributable to the complicated nature of the subject matter. Our research-based observational study \"QUAVER\" is rooted on the premise that the use of visual tools and narrative constructions has the potential to significantly augment comprehension and involvement within this domain. Prominent analytical techniques, such as the two-sample t-test, revealed a significant statistical difference between the two groups, as shown by the t-statistic and p-value, highlighting the considerable effectiveness of the visual-narrative strategy. One crucial aspect of our study is on the implementation of an exciting algorithmic framework designed specifically to optimize the integration of visual and narrative components in an integrated way. This algorithm utilizes sophisticated heuristic techniques to seamlessly integrate visual data and stories, offering learners a coherent and engaging instructional experience. The design of the material effectively manages the interplay between visual signals and narrative constructions, resulting in an ideal level of engagement and understanding for quantum computing subject. The results of our study strongly support the alternative hypothesis, providing evidence that the combination of visual information and stories has a considerable positive impact on participation in quantum computing education. This study not only introduces a significant approach to teaching quantum computing but also demonstrates the wider effectiveness of visual and narrative aids in complex scientific education in the digital age.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of laser sources for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), building on the proven capability of this technique to tackle important scientific questions. In this review, we aim to identify the key motivations and technologies that spurred the development of various laser sources, from frequency up-conversion in nonlinear crystals to high-harmonic generation in gases. We begin with a historical overview of the field in Sec.1, framed by advancements in light source and electron spectrometer technology. An introduction to the fundamental aspects of the photoemission process and the observables that can be studied is given in Sec.2, along with its dependencies on the pump and probe pulse parameters. The technical aspects of TR-ARPES are discussed in Sec.3. Here, experimental limitations such as space charge and resultant trade-offs in certain source parameters are discussed. Details of various systems and their approach to these trade-offs are given in Sec.4. Within this discussion, we present a survey of TR-ARPES laser sources; a meta-analysis of these source parameters showcases the advancements and trends in modern systems. Lastly, we conclude with a brief discussion of future directions for TR-ARPES and its capabilities in elucidating equilibrium and non-equilibrium observables, as well as its integration with micro-ARPES and spin-resolved ARPES (Sec.5).

    "abstract": "In the Earth-field range, the nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effect has been a bottleneck limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of atomic magnetometry from physical mechanism. To break this bottleneck, various techniques are introduced to suppress the NLZ effect. Here we revisit the spin dynamics in the Earth-field-range magnetometry and identify the existence of the intrinsic spin squeezed state (SSS) generated from the geomagnetically induced NLZ effect with the oscillating squeezing degree and squeezing axis. Such oscillating features of the SSS prevent its direct observation and as well, accessibility to magnetic sensing. To exploit quantum advantage of the intrinsic SSS in the Earth-field-range magnetometry, it's essential to lock the oscillating SSS to a persistent one. Hence, we develop a quantum locking technique to achieve a persistent SSS, benefiting from which the sensitivity of the Earth-field-range magnetometer is quantum-enhanced. This work presents an innovative way turning the drawback of NLZ effect into the quantum advantage and opens a new access to quantum-enhanced magnetometry in the Earth-field range. ",

The prototype has four small separate field probes, and all support electronics and optics are fitted into a single 19-inch rack to make it compact, mobile, and robust. The field probes are fiber coupled and made from non-metallic components, allowing them to be easily and safely positioned inside a 7 T MRI scanner. We demonstrate the capabilities of this magnetometer by measuring two different MRI sequences, and we show how it can be used to reveal imperfections in the gradient coil system, to highlight the potential applications in medical MRI.

We find that the measured behavior is well-described by a model combining analytical and numerical components for molecular and viscous flow, respectively. As this combined model relies exclusively on design and typical material parameters, we demonstrate calibration-less absolute gas pressure sensing.

Resonant cavity design is critical to the sensitivity of a haloscope, and several geometries have been utilised and proposed. Here we consider a relatively simple concept - a rectangular resonant cavity with a tunable wall - and compare it to the standard tuning rod-type resonators employed in the field. We find that the rectangular cavities support similar modes to cylindrical tuning rod cavities, and have some advantages in terms of axion sensitivity and practicality, particularly when moving to higher frequencies which are of great and growing interest in the international axion dark matter community.

The experiment is performed in a strongly coupled dusty plasma consisting of monodisperse micron particles levitated in the sheath of a capacitively coupled RF argon plasma. The non-planar waves are generated with the help of a cylindrical conducting exciter pin placed at the centre of the homogeneous dust cloud. A negative excitation pulse is used to create a dust void and a dust density perturbation simultaneously around the exciter. From the edge of the void, the density perturbation propagates as a nonlinear (cylindrical) non-planar dust acoustic solitary wave. The characteristics of the solitary wave are measured using image analysis of the recorded video of wave propagation. Numerical solution of the modified Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation with an additional term to take care of the non-planar geometry is compared with the experimental observation. The wave amplitude and width are measured as a function of time and compared with the theoretical predictions. ",

    "abstract": "In truncated coupled-cluster (CC) theories, non-variational and/or generally complex ground-state energies can occur. This is due to the non-Hermitian nature of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian matrix in combination with CC truncation. For chemical problems that deal with real-valued Hamiltonian matrices, complex CC energies rarely occur. However, for complex-valued Hamiltonian matrices, such as those that arise in the presence of strong magnetic fields, complex CC energies can be regularly observed unless certain symmetry conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, in the presence of magnetic fields, it is desirable to pursue CC methods that are guaranteed to give upper-bound, real-valued energies. In this work, we present the first application of unitary CC (UCC) to chemical systems in a strong magnetic field. This is achieved utilizing the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm applied to the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) method. We benchmark the method on the H$_2$ molecule in a strong magnetic field, and then calculate UCCSD energies for the H$_4$ molecule as a function of both geometry and field angle. We show that while standard CCSD can yield generally complex energies that are not an upper-bound to the true energy, UCCSD always results in variational and real-valued energies. We also show that the imaginary components of the CCSD energy are largest in the strongly correlated region. Lastly, the UCCSD calculations capture a large percentage of the correlation energy. ",

To access the information of strongly correlated quantum matters, one has to overcome or suppress dissipation to extract out the underlying quantum phenomena. However, here we find an opposite effect that dissipation can be utilized as a powerful tool to probe the intrinsic correlations of quantum many-body systems. Applying highly-controllable dissipation in ultracold atomic systems, we observe a universal dissipative dynamics in strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum gases. The total particle number of this system follows a universal stretched-exponential decay, and the stretched exponent measures the anomalous dimension of the spectral function, a critical exponent characterizing strong quantum fluctuations of this system. This method could have broad applications in detecting strongly correlated features, including spin-charge separations and Fermi arcs in quantum materials. ",

Various open- and closed-loop tracking schemes, all offering a trade-off between speed and precision, have been studied both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we advocate the use of a frequency counter as a frequency shift monitor in conjunction with a self-sustaining oscillator (SSO) nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) configuration. We derive a theoretical model for characterizing the speed and precision of frequency measurements with state-of-the-art frequency counters. Based on the understanding provided by this model, we introduce novel enhancements to frequency counters that result in a trade-off characteristics which is on a par with the other tracking schemes. We describe a low-cost field-programmable-gate array (FPGA) based implementation for the proposed frequency counter and use it with the SSO-NEMS device in order to study its frequency tracking performance. We compare the proposed approach with the phase-locked-loop based scheme both in theory and experimentally. Our results show that similar or better performance can be achieved at a substantially lower cost and improved ease-of-use.

This method is especially suited for applications where the duration of a single optimization step prohibits exploring the parameter space extensively or when there is no prior information on the optimal operation point.

However, the ability to locally tune all Hamiltonian parameters remains an outstanding goal that would enable the simulation of a wider range of quantum phenomena. Motivated by recent advances in quantum gas microscopes and optical tweezers, we here show theoretically how local control over individual tunnelling links in an optical lattice can be achieved by incorporating local time-periodic potentials. We propose to periodically modulate the on-site energy of individual lattice sites and employ Floquet theory to demonstrate how this can result in full individual control over the tunnelling amplitudes in one dimension. We provide various example configurations realising interesting topological models such as extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models that would be challenging to realize by other means. Extending to two dimensions, we present that local periodic driving in a three-site plaquette allows for full simultaneous control over the relative tunnelling amplitudes and the gauge-invariant flux piercing the plaquette, providing a clear stepping stone in building a fully programmable 2D tight-binding model. This local modulation scheme is applicable to many different lattice geometries. ",

To do so, we combine a quantum placement strategy to the 3D Reference Interaction Site Model (3D-RISM), an approach capable of predicting continuous solvent distributions. The intrinsic quantum nature of such coupling guarantees molecules not to be placed too close to each other, a constraint usually imposed by hand in classical approaches. We present first a full quantum adiabatic evolution model that uses a local Rydberg Hamiltonian to cast the general problem into an anti-ferromagnetic Ising model. Its solution, an NP-hard problem in classical computing, is embodied into a Rydberg atom array Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Following a classical emulator implementation, a QPU portage allows to experimentally validate the algorithm performances on an actual quantum computer. As a perspective of use on next generation devices, we emulate a second hybrid quantum-classical version of the algorithm. Such a variational quantum approach (VQA) uses a classical Bayesian minimization routine to find the optimal laser parameters. Overall, these Quantum-3D-RISM (Q-3D-RISM) algorithms open a new route towards the application of analog quantum computing in molecular modelling and drug design. ",
