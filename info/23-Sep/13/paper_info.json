    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, optical manipulation has emerged as a highly successful tool in various fields, such as biology, micro/nanorobotics, and physics. Among the different techniques, the transverse slot optical waveguide has shown remarkable potential in enhancing the field and significantly improving optical trapping capabilities. Additionally, microring resonators have demonstrated the ability to enhance the field at specific resonance wavelengths, enabling the manipulation and capture of particles. In this study, we investigated the impact of the structure on nanoparticle capture by introducing a 50 nm transverse slot in a 5 {\\mu}m microring resonator. Through the integration of a transverse slot in the microring resonator, we observed a substantial increase in the maximum bound optical power for a nanosphere with a refractive index of 1.6 and a diameter of 50 nm, reaching 3988.8 pN/W. This value is 2292 times higher than the maximum optical force in a straight waveguide and 2.266 times higher than the maximum optical force in a microring resonator. The proposed structure significantly enhances the optical trapping capabilities for nanoscale particles, thus paving the way for the development of advanced micro/nanomanipulation techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum rate theory encompasses the electron-transfer rate constant concept of electrochemical reactions as a particular setting, besides demonstrating that the electrodynamics of these reactions obey relativistic quantum mechanical rules. The theory predicts a frequency $\\nu = E/h$ for electron-transfer reactions, in which $E = e^2/C_q$ is the energy associated with the density-of-states $C_q/e^2$ and $C_q$ is the quantum capacitance of the electrochemical junctions. This work demonstrates that the $\\nu = E/h$ frequency of the intermolecular charge transfer of push-pull heterocyclic compounds, assembled over conducting electrodes, follows the above-stated quantum rate electrodynamic principles. Astonishingly, the differences between the molecular junction electronics formed by push-pull molecules and the electrodynamics of electrochemical reactions observed in redox-active modified electrodes are solely owing to an adiabatic setting (strictly following Landauer's ballistic presumption) of the quantum conductance in the push-pull molecular junctions. An appropriate electrolyte field-effect screening environment accounts for the resonant quantum conductance dynamics of the molecule-bridge-electrode structure, in which the intermolecular charge transfer dynamics within the frontier molecular orbital of push-pull heterocyclic molecules follow relativistic quantum mechanics in agreement with the quantum rate theory.

    "abstract": "We experimentally explored novel behaviors of non-reciprocal absorption and almost zero reflection in a dual photon resonator system, which is physically separated and composed of two inverted split ring resonators (ISRRs) with varying inter-distances. We also found that an electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT)-like peak at a specific inter-distance of d = 18 mm through traveling waves flowing along a shared microstrip line to which the dual ISRRs are dissipatively coupled. With the aid of CST-simulations and analytical modeling, we found that destructive and/or constructive interferences in traveling waves, indirectly coupled to each ISRR, result in a traveling-wave-induced transparency peak within a narrow window. Furthermore, we observed not only strong non-reciprocal responses of reflectivity and absorptivity at individual inter-distances exactly at the corresponding EIT-like peak positions, but also nearly zero reflection and almost perfect absorption for a specific case of d = 20 mm. Finally, the unidirectional absorptions with zero reflection at d = 20 mm are found to be ascribed to a non-Hermitian origin. This work not only provides a better understanding of traveling-wave-induced indirect coupling between two photonic resonators without magnetic coupling, but also suggests potential implications for the resulting non-reciprocal behaviors of absorption and reflection in microwave circuits and quantum information devices.

    "abstract": "We have developed a cryogenic characterization platform for ultrafast photodiodes, whose time domain responses are extracted by electro-optic sampling using femtosecond laser pulses in a pump-probe configuration. The excitation of the photodiodes with the pump beam and the electro-optic sampling crystals with the probe beam are realized in a fully fiber-coupled manner. This allows us to place the characterization platform in almost any temperature environment. As application example, we characterize the time-domain response of commercial p-i-n photodiodes with a nominal bandwidth of 20 GHz and 60 GHz at temperatures of 4 K and 300 K and in a large parameter range of photocurrent and reverse bias. For these photodiodes, we detect frequency components up to approximately 250 GHz, while the theoretical bandwidth of our sampling method exceeds 1 THz. Our measurements demonstrate a significant excitation power and temperature dependence of the photodiodes' ultrafast time responses, reflecting, most likely, changes in carrier mobilities and electric field screening. Since our system is an ideal tool to characterize and optimize the response of fast photodiodes at cryogenic temperatures, it has direct impact on applications in superconducting quantum technology such as the enhancement of optical links to superconducting qubits and quantum-accurate waveform generators.

An explicit usage of PBCs is often found missing in undergraduate texts on analytical treatment of lattice dynamics. The aim of the present work is to cover this gap by illustrating the application of Born-von Karman PBCs in lattice dynamical calculations using a computational approach. The equations of motion are set up for a linear diatomic lattice with a basis, using the nearest neighbour approximation. The solution is obtained by implementing fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm in python. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique is then used to obtain the phonon frequency spectrum corresponding to the computed solutions. Similar computations are extended to obtain the phonon spectrum for monatomic square and honeycomb lattices under the second nearest neighbour approximation. The computed results are validated against the analytical ones in each case. The target group of the present work are the students and educators at the undergraduate level. ",

We elucidate the functionality of our network in scenarios mimicking biological noise levels and showcase its application through a prototype involving an experimentally obtained chemical pattern.

    "abstract": "Development of advanced optical data storage, information encryption, and security labeling technologies requires low-cost materials exhibiting local, pronounced, and diverse modification of their structure-dependent optical properties under external excitation. Herein, for these purposes, we propose and develop a novel platform relying on layered lead halide Ruddlesden-Popper (quasi-2D) phases that undergo a light-induced transition towards bulk (3D) halide perovskite and employ this phenomenon for the direct optical writing of various multicolor patterns. This transition causes the weakening of quantum confinement, and hence the bandgap reduction in these photoluminescent thin films. To significantly extend the color gamut of evolving photoluminescence, we make use of mixed-halide compositions exhibiting photoinduced halide segregation. As a result, the emission wavelength of the resulting films can be widely tuned across the entire 450-600 nm range depending on the illumination conditions. We show that pulsed near-infrared femtosecond laser irradiation provides high-resolution direct writing, whereas continuous-wave ultraviolet exposure is suitable for fast recording on larger scales. The luminescent micro- and macro-scale images created on such quasi-2D perovskite films can be erased during the visualization process, by which the persistence of these images to UV light exposure can be controlled and increased further with the increasing number of octahedral layers used in the perovskite stacks. This makes the proposed writing/erasing perovskite-based platform suitable for the manufacturing of both inexpensive optical data storage devices and light-erasable security labels. ",

In a recent work [1], it was found via the sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) host a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic (LN), vison plaquette (VP) crystals and the Z2 quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases, and demonstrate via both the static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)d Cubic* universality in which the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, meanwhile leaves its trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional Cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.

Thus, a suite of wavefront sensors working in tandem with active and adaptive optics are used to achieve stable, nanometer-level wavefront control over long observations. In order to verify wavefront control systems comprehensive and accurate integrated models are needed. These should account for any sources of on-orbit error that may degrade performance past the limit imposed by photon noise. An integrated model of wavefront sensing and control for a space-based coronagraph was created using geometrical raytracing and physical optics propagation methods. Our model concept consists of an active telescope front end in addition to a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph instrument. The telescope uses phase retrieval to guide primary mirror bending modes and secondary mirror position to control the wavefront error within tens of nanometers. The telescope model is dependent on raytracing to simulate these active optics corrections for compensating the wavefront errors caused by misalignments and thermal gradients in optical components. Entering the coronagraph, a self-coherent camera is used for focal plane wavefront sensing and digging the dark hole. We utilize physical optics propagation to model the coronagraph's sensitivity to mid and high-order wavefront errors caused by optical surface errors and pointing jitter. We use our integrated models to quantify expected starlight suppression versus wavefront sensor signal-to-noise ratio. ",
