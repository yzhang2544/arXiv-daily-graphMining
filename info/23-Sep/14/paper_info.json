    "title": "The Quantum and thermodynamic properties of dyonic RN-like black holes",
    "abstract": "The effect of magnetic fields on black hole superradiance is an exciting topic with possible astrophysical applications. A dyonic RN-like black hole is not asymptotically flat. It describes a black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. This paper discusses the superadditive stability of binary RN black holes, asymptotically flat, band-like black holes. This article introduces the above condition into dyonic RN-like black holes if a dyonic RN-like black hole satisfies the requirement of $\\mu=y\\omega$, When $\\sqrt{2(B^2+Q^2)}/{r^2_+}< \\omega< q\\varPhi_H$,particularly $\\mu \\ge \\sqrt{2}(q\\varPhi_H)$,the dyonic RN-like black hole is superradiantly stable at that time.Scalars can be seen as combinations of positive/negative powers of a base, much like the decimal system. This principle is key in math and computing, from number systems to Fourier series (linked to $e^{i x}$ ). Dyonic RN-like black holes show no phase transition. ",

    "abstract": "In polarization experiments at storage rings, one of the challenges is to maintain the spin-resonance condition of a radio-frequency spin rotator with the spin-precessions of the orbiting particles. Time-dependent variations of the magnetic fields of ring elements lead to unwanted variations of the spin precession frequency. We report here on a solution to this problem by shielding (or masking) one of the bunches stored in the ring from the high-frequency fields of the spin rotator, so that the masked pilot bunch acts as a co-magnetometer for the other signal bunch, tracking fluctuations in the ring on a time scale of about one second. While the new method was developed primarily for searches of electric dipole moments of charged particles, it may have far-reaching implications for future spin physics facilities, such as the EIC and NICA.

    "abstract": "We propose an energy transfer model with a cubic atomic population dependence to accurately model the behavior of various reported high-power erbium-doped fluoride fiber lasers operating near 2.8 microns. We first show that the previously introduced weakly interacting (WI) and strongly interacting (SI) models are not adequate for precisely modeling such high-power erbium-doped fluoride fiber lasers. We compare results obtained with the WI and SI models to the proposed model by simulating 4 different highly doped (7 mol.%) fiber lasers previously reported in the literature. Laser efficiencies and powers are reproduced with great accuracy. In addition, four other independent fiber laser systems based on erbium doping concentrations varying from 1-6 mol.% are also simulated with good accuracy using the proposed model with the exact same set of spectroscopic parameters, which confirms its validity for various erbium doping concentrations. Redshifting of laser wavelength is also taken into account by considering the full cross section spectra and computing signal powers over several wavelength channels. ",

An oscillating radio-frequency (RF) electric field generated through a pair of parallel-placed copper plates leads to modulation of the Rydberg state by virtue of Stark effect where the frequency and strength of the sidebands quantify the RF electric field present. The variation of the strength of the EIT peak and the sidebands with RF voltage is observed to vary as a function of the Bessel function of modulation index. It provides an estimate of the atomic polarizability in the medium, which for $54S_{1/2}$ state, is found to be $(h)\\cdot1.01\\times10^8$ $\\text{Hz/(V/cm)}^2$. ",

    "abstract": "Interstellar communications are achievable with gram-scale spacecraft using swarm techniques introduced herein if an adequate energy source, clocks and a suitable communications protocol exist. The essence of our approach to the Breakthrough Starshot challenge is to launch a long string of 100s of gram-scale interstellar probes at 0.2c in a firing campaign up to a year long, maintain continuous contact with them (directly amongst each other and via Earth utilizing the launch laser), and gradually, during the 20-year cruise, dynamically coalesce the long string into a lens-shaped mesh network $\\sim$100,000 km across centered on the target planet Proxima b at the time of fly-by. In-flight formation would be accomplished using the \"time on target\" technique of grossly modulating the initial launch velocity between the head and the tail of the string, and combined with continual fine control or \"velocity on target\" by adjusting the attitude of selected probes, exploiting the drag imparted by the ISM. Such a swarm could tolerate significant attrition, e.g., by collisions enroute with interstellar dust grains, thus mitigating the risk that comes with \"putting all your eggs in one basket\". It would also enable the observation of Proxima b at close range from a multiplicity of viewpoints. Swarm synchronization with state-of-the-art space-rated clocks would enable operational coherence if not actual phase coherence in the swarm optical communications. Betavoltaic technology, which should be commercialized and space-rated in the next decade, can provide an adequate primary energy storage for these swarms. The combination would thus enable data return rates orders of magnitude greater than possible from a single probe. ",

    "abstract": "Solving the time-dependent quantum many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is a challenging task, especially for states at a finite temperature, where the environment affects the dynamics. Most existing approximating methods are designed to represent static thermal density matrices, 1D systems, and/or zero-temperature states. In this work, we propose a method to study the real-time dynamics of thermal states in two dimensions, based on thermofield dynamics, variational Monte Carlo, and neural-network quantum states. To this aim, we introduce two novel tools: (i) a procedure to accurately simulate the cooling down of arbitrary quantum variational states from infinite temperature, and (ii) a generic thermal (autoregressive) recurrent neural-network (ARNNO) Ansatz that allows for direct sampling from the density matrix using thermofield basis rotations. We apply our technique to the transverse-field Ising model subject to an additional longitudinal field and demonstrate that the time-dependent observables, including correlation operators, can be accurately reproduced for a 4x4 spin lattice. We provide predictions of the real-time dynamics on a 6x6 lattice that lies outside the reach of exact simulations. ",
