    "abstract": "In order for optical cavities to enable strong light-matter interactions for quantum metrology, networking, and scalability in quantum computing systems, their mirrors must have minimal losses. However, high-finesse dielectric cavity mirrors can degrade in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), increasing the challenges of upgrading to cavity-coupled quantum systems. We observe the optical degradation of high-finesse dielectric optical cavity mirrors after high-temperature UHV bake in the form of a substantial increase in surface roughness. We provide an explanation of the degradation through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), selective wet etching, and optical measurements. We find the degradation is explained by oxygen reduction in Ta$_2$O$_5$ followed by growth of tantalum sub-oxide defects with height to width aspect ratios near ten. We discuss the dependence of mirror loss on surface roughness and finally give recommendations to avoid degradation to allow for quick adoption of cavity-coupled systems. ",

In this paper, we study the optical LC-like resonances, which take place in high-index particles (HIPs) and involve optical or electromagnetic fields instead. The resonance effect is dominated by optical analogues of inductance and capacitance, which can be determined according to the electromagnetic energy bounded near the particle. The viewpoint of dielectric optical circuit with equivalent parameters facilitates the understanding of dielectric resonance effect.

The principle relied on detecting the change in the resonance wavelength due to the interaction of bacteria with the surrounding aqueous environment by utilizing the finite-difference time-domain numerical technique. Our proposed hyperbolic metamaterial \\textit{E. Coli} sensor operated in the range from visible to near-infrared wavelengths exhibiting strong bulk plasmon polaritons at the hyperbolic regime ($\\lambda \\geq$ 460 nm). An anisotropic hyperbolic range was obtained theoretically by solving the effective medium theory. An outstanding sensitivity of 9000 nm per bacteria was achieved for a bulk plasmon-polariton mode. The hyperbolic metamaterial was the origin of obtaining such extremely high sensitivity; no bulk plasmon polaritons were found without hyperbolic metamaterial. We analyzed the effect of different shapes in two-dimensional Ag differential grating on sensing performance. Additionally, we compared the performance parameters of our proposed \\textit{E. Coli} sensor with recently demonstrated sensors. Our proposed hyperbolic metamaterial structure has the potential as a highly sensitive \\textit{E.

    "abstract": "Understanding the target dynamics during its interaction with a relativistic ultrashort laser pulse is a challenging fundamental multi-physics problem involving at least atomic and solid-state physics, plasma physics, and laser physics. Already, the properties of the so-called pre-plasma formed as the laser pulse's rising edge ionizes the target are complicated to access in experiments and modeling, and many aspects of this laser-induced transition from solid to overdense plasma over picosecond time scales are still open questions. At the same time, applications like laser-driven ion acceleration require precise knowledge and control of the pre-plasma because the efficiency of the acceleration process itself crucially depends on the target properties at the arrival of the relativistic intensity peak of the pulse. By capturing the dynamics of the initial stage of the interaction, we report on a detailed visualization of the pre-plasma formation and evolution. Nanometer-thin diamond-like carbon foils are shown to transition from solid to plasma during the laser rising edge with intensities < 10^16 W/cm^2. Single-shot near-infrared probe transmission measurements evidence sub-picosecond dynamics of an expanding plasma with densities above 10^23 cm^-3 (about 100 times the critical plasma density). The complementarity of a solid-state interaction model and a kinetic plasma description provides deep insight into the interplay of ionization, collisions, and expansion. ",

Concerning the QCD axion, FLASH will search for these particles as the DM in the mass range (0.49-1.49) ueV, thus filling the mass gap between the ranges covered by other planned searches. A dedicated Microstrip SQUID operating at ultra-cryogenic temperatures will amplify the signal. The frequency range accessible overlaps with the Very High Frequency (VHF) range of the radio wave spectrum and allows for a search in GWs in the frequency range (100-300) MHz. The experiment will make use of the cryogenic plant and magnet of the FINUDA experiment at INFN Frascati National Laboratories near Rome (Italy); the operations needed to restore the functionalities of the apparatus are currently underway. We present the setup of the experiment and the sensitivity forecasts for the detection of axions, scalar fields, chameleons, hidden photons, and GWs. ",

    "abstract": "Single fiber imaging technology offers unique insights for research and inspection in difficult to reach and narrow spaces. In particular, ultra-compact multimode fiber (MMF) imaging, has received increasing interest over the past decade. However, MMF imaging will be seriously distorted when subjected to dynamic perturbations due to time-varying mode coupling, and the imaging of space objects via Gaussian beam will be relatively degraded at the edge due to insufficient contrast. Here, a robust super-resolution imaging method based on a ring core fiber (RCF) with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The OAM modes propagating in the RCF form a series of weakly-coupled mode groups, making our imaging system robust to external perturbations. In addition, a spiral phase plate is used as a vortex filter to produce OAM for edge enhancement, thus improving the image resolution. Furthermore, a few-shot U-Transformer neural network is proposed to enhance the resilience of the developed RCF-OAM imaging system against environmental perturbations. Finally, the developed RCF-OAM imaging system achieves biological image transmission, demonstrating the practicality of our scheme. This pioneering RCF OAM imaging system may have broad applications, potentially revolutionising fields such as biological imaging and industrial non-destructive testing. ",

We propose and demonstrate a Quantum Walk Laser in synthetic frequency space formed by externally modulating a ring-shaped semiconductor laser with ultrafast recovery times. In this device, the initially ballistic quantum walk does not dissipate into low supermode states of the synthetic lattice; instead, thanks to the fast-gain nonlinearity of our quantum cascade laser active material, the state stabilizes in a broad frequency comb, unlocking the full potential of the lattice. This device produces a low-noise, nearly-flat broadband comb (reaching 100 cm$^{-1}$ bandwidth), well predicted by our models. The proposed Quantum Walk Laser offers a promising platform to generate broadband, tunable and stable frequency combs. ",

    "abstract": "Computer-driven molecular design combines the principles of chemistry, physics, and artificial intelligence to identify novel chemical compounds and materials with desired properties for a specific application. In particular, quantum-mechanical (QM) methods combined with machine learning (ML) techniques have accelerated the estimation of accurate molecular properties, providing a direct mapping from 3D molecular structures to their properties. However, the development of reliable and efficient methodologies to enable \\emph{inverse mapping} in chemical space is a long-standing challenge that has not been accomplished yet. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the possibility of parametrizing a given chemical space with a finite set of extensive and intensive QM properties. In doing so, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation that combines a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) trained on molecular structures with a property encoder designed to learn the latent representation from a set of QM properties. The result of this joint architecture is a common latent space representation for both structures and properties, which enables property-to-structure mapping for small drug-like molecules contained in the QM7-X dataset. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by conditional generation of \\emph{de novo} molecular structures with targeted properties, transition path interpolation for chemical reactions as well as insights into property-structure relationships. Our findings thus provide a proof-of-principle demonstration aiming to enable the inverse property-to-structure design in diverse chemical spaces. ",

    "abstract": "The correlations of fluctuations are key to studying fundamental quantum physics and quantum many-body dynamics. They are also useful information for understanding and combating decoherence in quantum technology. Nonlinear spectroscopy and noise spectroscopy are powerful tools to characterize fluctuations, but they can access only very few among the many types of higher-order correlations. A systematic quantum sensing approach, called quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS), is recently proposed for extracting arbitrary types and orders of time-ordered correlations, using sequential weak measurement via a spin quantum sensor. However, the requirement of a central spin as the quantum sensor limits the versatility of the QNS since usually a central spin interacts only with a small number of particles in proximity and the measurement of single spins needs stringent conditions. Here we propose to employ the polarization (a pseudo-spin) of a coherent light beam as a quantum sensor for QNS. After interacting with a target system (such as a transparent magnetic material), the small Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized light can be measured, which constitutes a weak measurement of the magnetization in the target system. The correlated difference photon counts of a certain numbers of measurement shots can be made proportional to a certain type and order of correlations of the magnetic fluctuations in the material. This protocol of QNS is advantageous for studying quantum many-body systems. ",

    "abstract": "\"Hot atoms\", which are atoms in their excited states, transfer their energy to the surrounding atmosphere through collisions. This process of energy transfer is known as thermalization, and it plays a crucial role in various astrophysical and atmospheric processes. Thermalization of hot atoms is mainly governed by the amount of species present in the surrounding atmosphere and the collision cross-section between the hot atoms and surrounding species. In this work, we investigated the elastic and inelastic collisions between hot oxygen atoms and neutral N$_2$ molecules, relevant to oxygen gas escape from the martian atmosphere and for characterizing the chemical reactions in hypersonic flows. We conducted a series of quantum scattering calculations between various isotopes of O($^3P$) atoms and N$_2$ molecules across a range of collision energies (0.3 to 4 eV), and computed both their differential and collision cross-sections using quantum time$-$independent coupled-channel approach. Our differential cross-section results indicate a strong preference for forward scattering over sideways or backward scattering, and this anisotropy in scattering is further pronounced at higher collision energies. By comparing the cross-sections of three oxygen isotopes, we find that the heavier isotopes consistently have larger collision cross-sections than the lighter isotopes over the entire collision energy range examined. However, for all the isotopes, the variation of collision cross-section with respect to collision energy is the same. As a whole, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the energy distribution and thermalization processes of hot atoms within atmospheric environments. Specifically, the cross$-$sectional data presented in this work is directly useful in improving the accuracy of energy relaxation modeling of O and N$_2$ collisions over Mars and Venus atmospheres.
