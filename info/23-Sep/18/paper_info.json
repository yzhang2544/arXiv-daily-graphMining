    "abstract": "Ultrashort pulses can excite or ionize molecules and populate coherent electronic wavepackets, controlling the induced dynamics. In this letter, we simulate the quantum coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in full dimensionality upon ionization to different electronic wavepackets of benzene and fluoro-benzene molecules. In fluoro-benzene, the calculations unravel both inter-state and intra-state quantum interferences that leave clear signatures in the shape of the autocorrelation function. The latter could be measured experimentally via high harmonic spectroscopy. ",

    "abstract": "The remote sensing of abundance and properties of HCl -- the main atmospheric reservoir of Cl atoms which directly participate in ozone depletion -- are important for monitoring the partitioning of chlorine between \"ozone-depleting\" and \"reservoir\" species. Such remote studies require knowledge of the shapes of molecular resonances of HCl, which are perturbed by collisions with the molecules of the surrounding air. In this work, we report the first fully quantum calculations of collisional perturbations of the shape of a pure rotational line in H$^{35}$Cl perturbed by an air-relevant molecule (as the first model system we choose the R(0) line in HCl perturbed by O$_2$). The calculations are performed on our new highly-accurate HCl($X^1\\Sigma^+$)-O$_2$($X^3\\Sigma^-_g$) potential energy surface. In addition to pressure broadening and shift, we determine also their speed dependencies and the complex Dicke parameter. This gives important input to the community discussion on the physical meaning of the complex Dicke parameter and its relevance for atmospheric spectra (previously, the complex Dicke parameter for such systems was mainly determined from phenomenological fits to experimental spectra and the physical meaning of its value in that context is questionable). We also calculate the temperature dependence of the line-shape parameters and obtain agreement with the available experimental data. We estimate the total combined uncertainties of our calculations at 2\\% relative RMSE residuals in the simulated line shape at 296~K. This result constitutes an important step towards computational population of spectroscopic databases with accurate \\textit{ab initio} line-shape parameters for molecular systems of terrestrial atmospheric importance.

    "title": "MiniCACTUS: A 65 ps Time Resolution Depleted Monolithic CMOS Sensor",
    "abstract": "MiniCACTUS is a monolithic sensor prototype optimised for timing measurement of charged particles. It has been designed in a standard 150 nm CMOS process without dedicated amplification layer. It is intended as a demonstrator chip for future large scale timing detectors, like upgrades of timing detectors at LHC, or future high energy physics detector projects. The sensor features an active array of 2 x 4 diodes, analog and digital Front-Ends (FEs), a slow control interface, and bias circuitry programmable through internal DACs. The sensing element is a deep n-well/p-substrate diode. Thanks to the optimized guard-rings surrounding the whole chip, it is possible to apply safely more than 450 V on the high-resistivity substrate allowing fast charge collection. The baseline pixel dimensions are 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm and 0.5 mm x 1.0 mm. The analog FEs and the discriminators for each pixel are implemented outside the pixel, at the column level. The power consumption is approximately 300 mW/cm$\\mathbf {^2}$, which is compatible with cooling infrastructure available at LHC experiments, and making integration of this concept viable in future high energy physics experiments. After fabrication, the sensors have been thinned to 100 $\\mu$m, 200 $\\mu$m and 300 $\\mu$m total thickness and then post-processed for backside biasing. The time resolution of several sensors with different thicknesses has been measured in 3 test-beam campaigns using high energy muons (Minimum Ionizing Particles) at CERN SPS in 2021 and 2022. A resolution of 65.3 ps has been measured with on-chip FE and discriminator. This paper will focus on the results of these test-beam campaigns. ",

    "abstract": "Holographic optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a powerful imaging technique, but its ability to reveal low-reflectivity features is limited. In this study, we performed holographic OCT by incoherently averaging volumes with changing diffuse illumination of numerical aperture (NA) equal to the detection NA. While the reduction of speckle from singly scattered light is only modest, we discovered that speckle from multiply scattered light can be arbitrarily reduced, resulting in substantial improvements in image quality. This technique also offers the advantage of suppressing noises arising from spatial coherence, and can be implemented with a partially spatially incoherent light source for further mitigation of multiple scattering. Finally, we show that although holographic reconstruction capabilities are increasingly lost with decreasing spatial coherence, they can be retained over an axial range sufficient to standard OCT applications.

Hence, extracting the channel and the parasitic series resistances from S-parameters under these conditions enables analyzing their dependence on the gate and drain biases. This is fundamental to assess the portion of the output resistance that is controlled by the gate. Besides, the drain bias dependence of the drain and source resistances is also evidenced. Within the proposal, resistive components accounting for the lossy nature of the gate capacitance are incorporated into the model, which exhibits a broadband correlation with experimental data. This avoids the series resistances to be considered as frequency dependent in the model. ",

Moreover, by employing the EA model designed specifically for LGC, structural search is well achievable. The logical origins of the well performance of the framework are discussed in detail. Considering that such a theory guided, machine learning framework combines chemical principles and data-driven tools, most likely, it will be proven efficient to solve molecular design related problems in wider fields.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.
