    "abstract": "Here, we report simultaneous exhibition of both forward and inverse photonic Spin Hall effect in geometrically tailored anisotropic waveguided plasmonic crystal systems. The leaky hybridized quasiguided modes of the plasmonic crystal manifested in the far-field momentum (Fourier) domain as circular ring-like intensity distributions, and the different SOI effects revealed their exclusive signature as polarization-dependent azimuthal intensity lobes on top of it. Using a darkfield Fourier domain polarization Mueller matrix platform, we have observed input spin (circular polarization)- dependent trajectory of the quasiguided modes in the momentum domain (forward spin Hall effect) and its reciprocal effect as the wavevector controlled spin selection of the scattered leaky quasiguided modes (inverse spin Hall effect). These effects are separately manifested in characteristic Mueller matrix elements enabling their interpretation as geometrical circular anisotropy effects. Resonance-enabled enhancement and control of these effects are also demonstrated by exploiting the spectral Fano-type resonance. The far-field manifestation of spin-directional excitation of leaky quasiguided modes, their unique interpretation through momentum domain Mueller matrix, regulation and control of the SOI effects in plasmonic-photonic crystal systems, opens up exciting avenues in spin-orbit photonic research.

    "abstract": "Z. Xu, et al. [Phys. Rev. A 103, 023114 (2021)], have reported a measurement for the enhancement factor $\\kappa$, which characterizes the overlap of the electron wavefunction with the noble-gas nucleus in Cs-$^{129}$Xe spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP), that is more than an order of magnitude higher than previous experimental results and theoretical estimates. There is no plausible proposed physical basis for this discrepancy. As the authors repeatedly mischaracterize the nature and properties of the enhancement factor and do not completely describe their experimental technique, there is little reason to accept or consider this result in its current form in the context of future relevant work on Cs-Xe SEOP and its applications.

    "abstract": "We present and investigate theoretically photonic integrated filters based on 2 Sagnac coupled loop reflectors (SLRs) that are arranged in a self-coupled optical waveguide. We recently presented photonic integrated filters based on coupled and cascaded SLRs. In this paper, we advance this field by investigating a unique approach of employing coupled SLRs formed by self-coupled waveguides. This allows us to achieve high performance filter functions including Fano-like resonances and wavelength interleaving with a simpler design and a higher fabrication tolerance by tailoring coherent mode interference in the device. Our design takes into account the device fabrication issues as well as the requirements for practical applications. As a guide for practical device fabrication, an analysis of the impact of the structural parameters and fabrication tolerance on each filter function is also provided. The Fano-like resonances show a low insertion loss (IL) of 1.1 dB, a high extinction ratio of 30.2 dB, and a high slope rate (SR) of 747.64 dB/nm. The combination of low IL and high SR promises this device for Fano resonance applications. Our device also can achieve wavelength de-interleaving function with high fabrication tolerance which is advantageous for applications such as optical interleavers that require a symmetric flat-top filter shape. Optical de-interleavers and interleavers are key components for optical signal multiplexing and demultiplexing for wavelength division multiplexing optical communication systems. Versatile spectral responses with a simple design, compact device footprint, and high fabrication tolerance make this approach highly promising for flexible response shaping for many applications. ",

    "abstract": "Charge Transfer (CT) has enjoyed continuous interest due to increasing experimental control over molecular structure leading to applications in, for example, photovoltaics and hydrogen production. In this paper, we investigate the effect of CT states on the absorption spectrum of linear molecular aggregates using a scattering matrix technique that allows us to deal with arbitrarily large systems. The presented theory performs well for both strong and weak mixing of exciton and CT states, bridging the gap between previously employed methods which are applicable in only one of these limits. In experimental spectra the homogeneous linewidth is often too large to resolve all optically allowed transitions individually, resulting in a characteristic two-peak absorption spectrum in both the weak- and strong-coupling regime. Using the scattering matrix technique we examine the contributions of free and bound states in detail. We conclude that the skewness of the high-frequency peak may be used as a new way to identify the exciton-CT-state coupling strength. ",

However, some traditional lensless imaging methods suffer from slow convergence, mechanical errors and conjugate solution interference, which limit its further application and development. In this work, we proposed a lensless imaging method based on spatial light modulator (SLM) with unknown modulation curve. In our imaging system, we use SLM to modulate the wavefront of object, and introduce the ptychographic scanning algorithm that is able to recover the complex amplitude information even the SLM modulation curve is inaccurate or unknown. In addition, we also design a split-beam interference experiment to calibrate the modulation curve of SLM, and using the calibrated modulation function as the initial value of the expended ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) algorithm can improve the convergence speed. We further analyze the effect of modulation function, algorithm parameters and the characteristics of the coherent light source on the quality of reconstructed image. The simulated and real experiments show that the proposed method is superior to traditional mechanical scanning methods in terms of recovering speed and accuracy, with the recovering resolution up to 14 um.

By combining local control over the wave amplitude, phase, and polarization into a single tunable structure, a multi-functional and reconfigurable metasurface can be realized, capable of full control over incident radiation. Here, we experimentally validate a multi-functional metasurface architecture for the microwave regime, where in principle variable loads are connected behind the backplane to reconfigurably shape the complex surface impedance. As a proof-of-concept step, we fabricate several metasurface instances with static loads in different configurations (surface mount capacitors and resistors of different values in different connection topologies) to validate the approach and showcase the different achievable functionalities. Specifically, we show perfect absorption for oblique incidence (both polarizations), broadband linear polarization conversion, and beam splitting, demonstrating control over the amplitude, polarization state, and wavefront, respectively. Measurements are performed in the 4-18 GHz range inside an anechoic chamber and show good agreement with theoretically-anticipated results. Our results clearly demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed architecture for reconfigurable electromagnetic wave manipulation. ",

This produces an absorption extending over the $\\sim 2-3.5$THz frequency range. Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of silicon and aluminum, the absorbed radiation induces a deformation of the cantilever, which is read out optically using a $1.5\\mu$m laser diode.

This yields an noise-equivalent-power of 20 nW/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 2.5THz.

Both approaches, dubbed amfX2C and e(xtended)amfX2C, allow us to uniquely tailor PCE corrections to mean-field models, $viz.$ Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham DFT, in the latter case also avoiding the need of a point-wise calculation of exchange-correlation PCE corrections. We assess the numerical performance of these PCE correction models on spinor energies of group-18 (closed-shell) and group-16 (open-shell) diatomic molecules, achieving a consistent $\\approx\\!10^{-5}$ Hartree accuracy compared to reference four-component data. Additional tests include SCF calculations of molecular properties such as absolute contact density and contact density shifts in copernicium fluoride compounds (CnF$_{n}$, n=2,4,6), as well as equation-of-motion coupled cluster calculations of X-ray core ionization energies of $5d$ and $6d$-containing molecules, where we observe an excellent agreement with reference data. To conclude, we are confident that our (e)amfX2C PCE correction models constitute a fundamental milestone towards a universal and reliable relativistic two-component quantum chemical approach, maintaining the accuracy of the parent four-component one at a fraction of its computational cost.

The transfer of wave momentum is a fundamental mechanism for contactless manipulation, yet the rules of conventional scattering intrinsically limit the radiation force based on the shape and the size of the manipulated object. Here, we show that this intrinsic limit can be overcome for acoustic waves with subwavelength-structured metasurfaces, where the force becomes controllable by the arrangement of surface features, independent of the object's overall shape and size. Harnessing such anomalous metasurface scattering, we demonstrate complex actuation phenomena: self-guidance, where a metasurface object is autonomously guided by an acoustic wave, and contactless pulling, where a metasurface object is pulled by the wave. Our results show that bringing metasurface physics, and its full arsenal of tools, to the domain of mechanical manipulation opens the door to diverse actuation mechanisms that are beyond the limits of traditional wave-matter interactions.
