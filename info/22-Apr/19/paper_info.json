    "abstract": "The optical geometric phase encoded by the in-plane spatial orientation of microstructures has promoted the rapid development of numerous new-type optical meta-devices. However, pushing the concept of the geometric phase toward the acoustic community still faces challenges. In this work, we take advantage of two acoustic nonlocal metagratings that could support the direct conversion between plane wave and designated vortex mode, of which the orbital angular momentum conversion process plays a vital role in obtaining the acoustic geometric phase. We obtain the acoustic geometric phases of different orders by merely varying the orientation angle of one of the acoustic nonlocal metagratings. Intriguingly, according to our developed theory, we reveal that the reflective acoustic geometric phase, which is twice of the transmissive one, can be readily realized by transferring the transmitted configuration to a reflected one. Both the theoretical model and experimental measurements successfully verify the announced transmissive and reflective acoustic geometric phases. Moreover, the characteristics of reconfigurability and continuous phase modulation that covers the 2{\\pi} range shown by the acoustic geometric phases provide us with new possibilities in advanced acoustic wavefront control.

To this end, we argue that coherent reflection near and in the bandgap attenuates the generation of diffuse or localized photons. Using the eminent self-consistent theory of localization and considering the density of states of photons, we can quantitatively describe all transport regimes: Transparency, light diffusion, localization, and bandgap. Comparing the model with numerical data on optical transport in hyperuniform dielectric networks confirms our findings. ",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning models have demonstrated a great ability to learn complex patterns and make predictions. In high-dimensional nonlinear problems of fluid dynamics, data representation often greatly affects the performance and interpretability of machine learning algorithms. With the increasing application of machine learning in fluid dynamics studies, the need for physically explainable models continues to grow. This paper proposes a feature learning algorithm based on variational autoencoders, which is able to assign physical features to some latent variables of the variational autoencoder. In addition, it is theoretically proved that the remaining latent variables are independent of the physical features. The proposed algorithm is trained to include shock wave features in its latent variables for the reconstruction of supercritical pressure distributions. The reconstruction accuracy and physical interpretability are also compared with those of other variational autoencoders. Then, the proposed algorithm is used for the inverse design of supercritical airfoils, which enables the generation of airfoil geometries based on physical features rather than the complete pressure distributions. It also demonstrates the ability to manipulate certain pressure distribution features of the airfoil without changing the others. ",

We find that the nonlinear coupling between confined optical modes on the chip and continuum modes in free space can be greatly enhanced on the platform of integrated microcavity, with feasible relaxation of the phase-matching condition. With an infrared pump laser, we observe the vertical radiation of second-harmonic wave at the visible band, which indicates a robust phase-matching-free chip-to-free-space frequency converter and also unveils an extra energy dissipation channel for integrated devices. Such an unexpected coherent nonlinear interaction between the free-space beam and the confined mode is also validated by the different frequency generation. Furthermore, based on the phase-matching-free nature of the nonlinear radiation, we build an integrated atomic gas sensor to characterize Rb isotopes with a single telecom laser. The unveiled mechanism of nonlinear optical radiation is universal for all dielectric photonic integrated devices, and provides a simple and robust chip-to-free-space as well as visible-to-telecom interface.

The demand for accurate contact-less devices was motivated by the need for cross-infection reduction and the shortage of conventional oximeters, partially due to the global supply chain issue. This paper evaluated a contact-less mini-program HealthyPai's heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements compared with other wearable devices. In the HR study of 185 samples (81 in the laboratory environment, 104 in the real-life environment), the mean absolute error (MAE) $\\pm$ standard deviation was $1.4827 \\pm 1.7452$ in the lab, $6.9231 \\pm 5.6426$ in the real-life setting. In the SpO2 study of 24 samples, the mean absolute error (MAE) $\\pm$ standard deviation of the measurement was $1.0375 \\pm 0.7745$. Our results validated that HealthyPai utilizing the Integrated Image Deep Learning Solution (IIDLS) framework can accurately measure HR and SpO2, providing the test quality at least comparable to other FDA-approved wearable devices in the market and surpassing the consumer-grade and research-grade wearable standards.

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) based gas sensors with high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, low cost, and small footprint are desirable across a broad range of applications in energy, environment, safety, and public health. However, most works have focused on either acoustic resonator to enhance acoustic wave or optical resonator to enhance optical wave. Herein, we develop a gas sensor based on doubly resonant PAS in which the acoustic and optical waves are simultaneously enhanced using combined optical and acoustic resonators in a centimeter-long configuration. Not only the lower detection limit is enhanced by the double standing waves, but also the upper detection limit is expanded due to the short resonators. As an example, we developed a sensor by detecting acetylene (C2H2), achieving a noise equivalent absorption of 5.7*10-13 cm-1 and a dynamic range of eight orders. Compared to the state-of-the-art PAS gas sensors, the developed sensor increases the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude and extends the dynamic range by three orders of magnitude. Besides, a laser-cavity-molecule locking strategy is proposed to provide additional flexibility of fast gas detection. ",

We suggest that a positive outcome to these experimenst would rule out a class of quantum gravity models that we refer to as $\\psi$-incomplete quantum gravity (PIQG) - i.e. models of the interaction between quantum mechanics and gravity in which gravity is coupled to non-quantum beables rather than quantum beables. We review some existing PIQG models and consider what more needs to be done to make these sorts of approaches more appealing, and finally we discuss a cosmological phenomenon which could be regarded as providing evidence for PIQG models.

Using Stokes' drag law, we were able to obtain the radius of the trapped bubbles and estimate the minimum acoustic force necessary to trap them, which ranged from 3 nN to 780 nN. We also present the force profile as a function of distance for different bubble that were trapped experimentally, and show that a standing wave formed by interfering infinite plane waves cannot explain the observed acoustic trapping of bubbles in 3-D.

The dynamic OCT is based on repeating raster scan and logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) analysis which enables volumetric metabolic imaging with a standard-speed (50,000 A-lines/s) OCT system. Metabolic domains associated with lipid droplet accumulation and inflammation are clearly visualized three-dimensionally. Particularly, the normal-diet liver exhibits highly metabolic vessel-like structures of peri-vascular hepatic zones. The 1-week MCD-diet liver shows ring-shaped highly metabolic structures formed with lipid droplets. The 2-week MCD-diet liver exhibits fragmented vessel-like structures associated with inflammation. These results imply that volumetric LIV imaging is useful for visualizing and assessing NAFLD abnormalities. ",

In contrast to snow's apparent properties like the albedo, measuring the intrinsic properties is challenging, Here, we present a simple apparatus that can measure bulk optical properties of snow using readily available components and a smartphone camera, and a robust diffuse-optical framework for data analysis. We demonstrate the instrument both on scattering phantoms with known scattering and absorption coefficient as well as in the field.

We demonstrate the design by creating a 2D array of 1225 dark trap sites, where single Cs atoms are loaded into regions of near-zero intensity in an approximately Gaussian profile trap. Moreover, we demonstrate a simple solution to the problem of out-of-focus trapped atoms, which occurs due to the Talbot effect in periodic optical lattices.
