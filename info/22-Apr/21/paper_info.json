    "abstract": "Recently, we showed that dielectric mesoscale spheres could support so-called super-resonance effect, i.e. high-order Mie resonance modes with giant field localization and enhancement. Due to the presence of the surrounding medium leads to a significant influence in the intensity of the field in the particle, based on Mie theory we show for the first time that this effect may be use to design refractive index sensor of medium. Using the example of air as an environment, we have shown that the sensitivity of the proposed sensor concept can reach from 10-6 to 10-8, depending on the accuracy of the sphere size parameter, which is no worse than the accuracy of modern interference methods.

    "abstract": "A pulse shape designer for direct drive inertial confinement fusion has been developed, it aims at high compression of the fusion fuel while keeping hydrodynamics instability within tolerable level. Fast linear analysis on implosion instability enables the designer to fully scan the vast pulse configuration space at a practical computational cost, machine learning helps to summarize pulse performance into an implicit scaling metric that promotes the pulse shape evolution. The designer improves its credibility by incorporating various datasets including extra high-precision simulations or experiments. When tested on the double-cone ignition scheme [J. Zhang et al, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A. 378.2184 (2020)], optimized pulses reach the assembly requirements, show significant imprint mitigation and adiabatic shaping capability, and have the potential to achieve better implosion performance in real experiments. This designer serves as an efficient alternative to traditional empirical pulse shape tuning procedure, reduces workload and time consumption. The designer can be used to quickly explore the unknown parameter space for new direct-drive schemes, assists design iteration and reduces experiment risk. ",

Particularly powerful are circuits based on meshes of reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometers as they enable active processing of light. Various possibilities exist to get light into such circuits. Sampling an electromagnetic field distribution with a carefully designed free-space interface is one of them. Here, a reconfigurable PIC is used to optically sample and process free-space beams so as to implement a spatially resolving detector of amplitudes and phases. In order to perform measurements of this kind we develop and experimentally implement a versatile method for the calibration and operation of such integrated photonics based detectors. Our technique works in a wide parameter range, even when running the chip off the design wavelength. Amplitude, phase and polarization sensitive measurements are of enormous importance in modern science and technology, providing a vast range of applications for such detectors. ",

By optimizing our molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth technique, we were able to reduce the amount of Ge within the whole resonator to obtain an absolute minimum of exactly one QD, accurately positioned by lithographic methods relative to the PhCR, and an otherwise flat, a few monolayer thin, Ge wetting layer (WL). With this method, record quality (Q) factors for QD-loaded PhCRs up to $Q\\sim 10^5$ are achieved. A comparison with control PhCRs on samples containing a WL but no QDs is presented, as well as a detailed analysis of the dependence of the resonator-coupled emission on temperature, excitation intensity, and emission decay after pulsed excitation. Our findings undoubtedly confirm a single QD in the center of the resonator as a potentially novel photon source in the telecom spectral range. ",

The formalism of the fishbone-like equation contains all the necessary ingredients to describe the features of these low frequency fluctuations, and explain experimental findings. Core plasma properties (diamagnetic frequency and precession resonance with trapped ions) strongly affect the excitation of the modes, and in the case of BAAEs more effectively than the energetic particles. The diamagnetic frequency of the core plasma also contributes to the coupling of the BAAEs with the KBMs, thus affecting the excitation and polarization of both modes. Energetic particles can still provide a non-resonant drive to some of the low frequency modes. ",

Recent theoretical studies [New J. Phys., 22 093030 (2020)] have found that high-order frequency mixing (HFM) in a two-color laser field can be much more efficient than high-order harmonic generation (HHG). Here we study the attosecond properties of the coherent XUV generated via HFM analytically and numerically, focusing on the practically important case when one of the fields has much lower frequency and much lower intensity than the other one. We derive simple analytical equations describing intensities and phase locking of the HFM spectral components. We show that the duration of attosecond pulses generated via HFM, while being very similar to that obtained via HHG in the plateau, is shortened for the cut-off region. Moreover, our study demonstrates that the carrier-envelope phase of the attopulses produced via HFM, in contrast to HHG, can be easily controlled by the phases of the generating fields. ",

    "abstract": "The combination of graphene with silicon in hybrid devices has attracted attention extensively over the last decade. Most of such devices were proposed for photonics and radiofrequency applications. In this work, we present a unique technology of graphene-on-silicon heterostructures and their properties as solution-gated transistors. The graphene-on-Silicon field-effect transistors (GoSFETs) were fabricated exploiting various conformations of drain-source regions doping and channel material dimensions. The fabricated devices were electrically characterized demonstrating hybrid behavior with features specific to both graphene and silicon. Although GoSFET's transconductance and carrier's mobility were found to be lower than in conventional silicon and graphene field-effect transistors (SiFETs and GFETs), it was demonstrated that the combination of both materials within the hybrid channel contribute uniquely to the charge carrier transport. A comprehensive physics-based compact modeling was specifically developed, showing excellent agreement with the experimental data. The model is employed to rationalize the observed hybrid behavior as the theoretical results from the electrostatics and the carrier transport under a drift-diffusion approach show that graphene acts as a shield for the silicon channel, giving rise to a non-uniform potential distribution along it, especially at the subthreshold region. This graphene screening effect is shown to strongly affect the device subthreshold swing when compared against a conventional SiFET due to a non-negligible diffusion current in this operation regime.

Such hardware combines integrated-photonic components for few-photon, light-speed communication with superconducting circuits for fast, energy-efficient computation. Monolithic integration of superconducting and photonic devices is necessary for the scaling of this technology. In the present work, superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors are monolithically integrated with Josephson junctions for the first time, enabling the realization of superconducting optoelectronic synapses. We present circuits that perform analog weighting and temporal leaky integration of single-photon presynaptic signals. Synaptic weighting is implemented in the electronic domain so that binary, single-photon communication can be maintained. Records of recent synaptic activity are locally stored as current in superconducting loops. Dendritic and neuronal nonlinearities are implemented with a second stage of Josephson circuitry. The hardware presents great design flexibility, with demonstrated synaptic time constants spanning four orders of magnitude (hundreds of nanoseconds to milliseconds). The synapses are responsive to presynaptic spike rates exceeding 10 MHz and consume approximately 33 aJ of dynamic power per synapse event before accounting for cooling. In addition to neuromorphic hardware, these circuits introduce new avenues towards realizing large-scale single-photon-detector arrays for diverse imaging, sensing, and quantum communication applications.

One specific application is the drying of wet powders in the pharmaceutical industry, where quantifying the particle size distribution (PSD) is of particular interest. A non-invasive and real-time monitoring probe in the drying process is required, but there is no suitable candidate for this purpose. In this report, we develop a theoretical relationship from the PSD to the speckle image and describe a physics-enhanced autocorrelation-based estimator (PEACE) machine learning algorithm for speckle analysis to measure the PSD of a powder surface. This method solves both the forward and inverse problems together and enjoys increased interpretability, since the machine learning approximator is regularized by the physical law. ",
