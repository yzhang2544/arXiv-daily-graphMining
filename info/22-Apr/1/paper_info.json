    "abstract": "We show theoretically that an intense femtosecond optical pulse incident normally on a metal surface tends to decay into a pair of counter-propagating surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs). The interference field heats the medium periodically, which causes a periodic permittivity perturbation and resonantly amplifies the magnitudes of SPPs. The instability growth time is only 10-50 fs for typical metals at damaging laser fluences. This mechanism is promising for the interpretation of laser-induced periodic surface structures formation in a single-pulse pumping regime. ",

    "title": "Chip-Based Laser with 1 Hertz Integrated Linewidth",
    "abstract": "Lasers with hertz-level linewidths on timescales up to seconds are critical for precision metrology, timekeeping, and manipulation of quantum systems. Such frequency stability typically relies on bulk-optic lasers and reference cavities, where increased size is leveraged to improve noise performance, but with the trade-off of cost, hand assembly, and limited application environments. On the other hand, planar waveguide lasers and cavities exploit the benefits of CMOS scalability but are fundamentally limited from achieving hertz-level linewidths at longer times by stochastic noise and thermal sensitivity inherent to the waveguide medium. These physical limits have inhibited the development of compact laser systems with frequency noise required for portable optical clocks that have performance well beyond conventional microwave counterparts. In this work, we break this paradigm to demonstrate a compact, high-coherence laser system at 1548 nm with a 1 s integrated linewidth of 1.1 Hz and fractional frequency instability less than 10$^{-14}$ from 1 ms to 1 s. The frequency noise at 1 Hz offset is suppressed by 11 orders of magnitude from that of the free-running diode laser down to the cavity thermal noise limit near 1 Hz$^2$/Hz, decreasing to 10$^{-3}$ Hz$^2$/Hz at 4 kHz offset. This low noise performance leverages wafer-scale integrated lasers together with an 8 mL vacuum-gap cavity that employs micro-fabricated mirrors with sub-angstrom roughness to yield an optical $Q$ of 11.8 billion. Significantly, all the critical components are lithographically defined on planar substrates and hold the potential for parallel high-volume manufacturing. Consequently, this work provides an important advance towards compact lasers with hertz-level linewidths for applications such as portable optical clocks, low-noise RF photonic oscillators, and related communication and navigation systems.

    "abstract": "Fiber optic distributed sensors typically demand bidirectional propagation in optical fibers to localize each point of measurement. This imposes barriers to their deployment in long-haul, amplified telecommunication links and prevents massive range enhancement through in-line amplification, due to the typical presence of non-reciprocal elements such as isolators. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new method for distributed sensing that localizes the measurand information in a single unidirectional transmission measurement in fibers carrying at least two weakly coupled non-degenerate co-propagating modes, using swept wavelength interferometry for interrogation. We experimentally demonstrate our proof-of-principle, achieving quantitative strain and temperature measurements with measurand resolutions of 1.2 $\\mu\\varepsilon$ and 0.135 K, respectively, and spatial resolutions in the tens of meter range, using SMF-28 as a three-mode fiber at 1064 nm center wavelength. These results can be extended to other space-division-multiplexing-ready fibers operating in telecom wavelength bands. Our work paves the way for ultra-long range distributed sensing that is compatible with currently evolving amplified space-division multiplexed telecommunication links. ",

    "abstract": "An experimental study to investigate the effect of an external magnetic field on the propagation of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) has been carried out in hydrogen plasma containing two-temperature electrons and dust grains. A low-pressure hot cathode discharge method is opted for plasma production. The desired two electron groups with distinct temperatures are achieved by inserting two magnetic cages with a cusp-shaped magnetic field of different surface field strengths in the same chamber. The dust grains are dropped into the plasma with the help of a dust dropper, which gain negative charges by interacting with the plasma. The IAWs are excited with the help of a mesh-grid inserted into the plasma. A planar Langmuir probe is used as a detector to detect the IAWs. The time of flight technique has been applied to measure the phase velocity of the IAWs. The results suggest that in the presence of a magnetic field, the phase velocity of IAWs increases, whereas introducing the dust particles leads to the lower phase velocity. The magnetic field is believed to have a significant effect on the wave damping. This study will aid in utilising IAWs as a diagnostic tool to estimate plasma parameters in the presence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the study might be useful for estimating the relative ion concentrations in a two positive ion species plasma, as well as the relative concentration of the negative ions in the presence of an external magnetic field.

    "abstract": "Scattering-assisted synthesis of broadband optical pulses is recognized to have a cross-disciplinary funda-mental and application importance. Achieving full-waveform synthesis generally requires means for assessing the instantaneous electric field, i.e. the absolute electromagnetic phase. These are generally not accessible to established methodologies for scattering-assisted pulse envelope and phase shaping. The lack of field sensitivity also results in complex indirect approaches to evaluate the scattering space-time properties. The terahertz frequency domain potentially offers some distinctive new possibilities thanks to the availability of methods to perform absolute measurements of the scattered electric field, as opposed to optical intensity-based diagnostics. An interesting conceptual question is whether this additional degree of freedom can lead to different types of methodologies toward wave shaping and to a direct field-waveform control. In this work, we theoretically investigate a deterministic scheme to achieve broadband, spatio-temporal waveform control of terahertz fields mediated by a scattering medium. The direct field access via Time-Domain Spectroscopy enables a process in which the field and scattering matrix of the medium are assessed with minimal experimental efforts. Then, the illumination conditions for an arbitrary targeted output field waveform are deterministically determined. In addition, the complete field knowledge enables reconstructing field distributions with complex phase profiles, as in the case of phase-only masks and optical vortices, a significantly challenging task for traditional implementations at optical frequencies based on intensity measurements aided with interferometric techniques.

While implementing a convenient way to distribute power in a single step, star coupler architecture is inefficient in terms of employed waveguide length and thus, optical loss and footprint. Multi-input approach partially alleviates this by condensing several single-input devices into one, permitting to reduce the footprint proportionally to the employed number of inputs.

Next, we explore the mirror formed through polarization mode-splitting in a thin-film lithium niobate micro-resonator. By exciting the Bloch waves of the synthetic frequency crystal with different wave vectors, we show various states formed by the interference between forward propagating and reflected waves. Finally, we expand on this idea, and generate tunable frequency mirrors as well as demonstrate trapped states formed by these mirrors using coupled lithium niobate micro-resonators. The ability to control the flow of light in the frequency domain could enable a wide range of applications, including the study of random walks, boson sampling, frequency comb sources, optical computation, and topological photonics. Furthermore, demonstration of optical elements such as cavities, lasers, and photonic crystals in the frequency domain, may be possible. ",

While most variational quantum algorithms involve only continuous optimization variables, the representational power of the variational ansatz can sometimes be significantly enhanced by adding certain discrete optimization variables, as is exemplified by the generalized quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). However, the hybrid discrete-continuous optimization problem in the generalized QAOA poses a challenge to the optimization. We propose a new algorithm called MCTS-QAOA, which combines a Monte Carlo tree search method with an improved natural policy gradient solver to optimize the discrete and continuous variables in the quantum circuit, respectively.

Motivated by the fact that the imaginary part of the optical conductivity can have significant effects on the optical response and is an important factor of consideration for developing $\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice based optical devices, we are led to derive a complete conductivity formula with both the real and imaginary parts. Scrutinizing the formula, we uncover two phenomena. First, for the value of $\\alpha$ in some range, two types of optical transitions coexist: one between the two Dirac cones and another from the flat band to a cone, which generate multi-frequency transverse electrical propagating waves. Second, for $\\alpha=1$ so the quasiparticles become pseudospin-1, the flat-to-cone transition can result in resonant scattering.

A common feature across almost all of these applications is the need for increased numbers of resonators to further improve sensitivity, and the ability to read out large numbers of resonators without the need for additional cryogenic complexity is a primary motivation. One of the major limitations of current resonator arrays is the observed scatter in the resonator frequencies when compared to the initial design. Here we present recent progress toward identifying one of the dominant underlying causes of resonator scatter, inductor line width fluctuation. We designed and fabricated an array of lumped-element resonators with inductor line width changing from 1.8um to 2.2um in step of 0.1um defined with electron-beam lithography to probe and quantify the systematic variation of resonance frequency across a 6-inch wafer. The resonators showed a linear frequency shift of 20MHz (140FWHM) and 30MHz (214FWHM), respectively, as they are connected to two different capacitors. This linear relationship matches our theoretical prediction. The widely used MLA photon lithography facility for MKID fabrication has a resolution on the order of 600nm, which could cause frequency fluctuation on the order of 100MHz or 710FWHM. ",
