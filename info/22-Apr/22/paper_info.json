    "abstract": "We describe here a method to generate high-definition arbitrary laser beam shapes and profiles useful to many applications, ranging from optical patterning and lithography to optical trapping of microscopic particles and ultracold atoms. The phase contrast between a binary grating and a targeted intensity distribution is encoded on a spatial light modulator to control light diffraction, producing very sharp, speckles-free, and smooth images. Besides simplicity, not requiring additional phase-plates, the method provides straightforward encoding of images onto phase-only masks by a direct pixel mapping, allowing simpler feedback schemes to correct and control light distributions and optical potentials in real-time.

    "abstract": "The ability to perform nanometer-scale optical imaging and spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low-energy effects in quantum materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological samples. The scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) technique has recently spread to many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. In this brief perspective, we show that the s-SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in many ways from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We show that, with the help of AI- and ML-enhanced data acquisition and analysis, scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate, and intelligent. ",

    "abstract": "New data was obtained for a frequency band that had not been so well-studied for sea surface probing applications before. During the described 2-weeks sea experiment 1-3 kHz tonal pulses were emitted from a platform, located on the northern Black Sea shelf, and Doppler spectrum of reverberation was studied. We believe that this band is worth further studying due the sound propagation range is large enough to meet practical needs in coastal zone while the angle-distance resolution is quite moderate. However it is quite difficult to interpret the obtained data since backscattering spectrum shape is influenced by a series of effects and has a complicated link to wind waves and currents parameters. Backscattering of acoustical signals was received for distances around 2 nautical miles. Significant wave height, dominant wave frequency were estimated as the result of such signals processing with the use of machine learning tools. A decision-tree-based mathematical regression model was trained to solve the inverse problem. Wind waves prediction is in a good agreement with direct measurements, made on the platform, and machine learning results allow physical interpretation. ",

    "abstract": "Schr{\\\"o}dinger noticed in 1952 that a scalar complex wave function can be made real by a gauge transformation. The author showed recently that one real function is also enough to describe matter in the Dirac equation in an arbitrary electromagnetic or Yang--Mills field. This suggests some \"symmetry\" between positive and negative frequencies and, therefore, particles and antiparticles, so the author previously considered a description of one-particle wave functions as plasma-like collections of a large number of particles and antiparticles. The description has some similarities with Bohmian mechanics. This work offers a criterion for approximation of continuous charge density distributions by discrete ones with quantized charge based on the equality of partial Fourier sums, and an example of such approximation is computed using the homotopy continuation method. An example mathematical model of the description is proposed. The description is also extended to composite particles, such as nucleons or large molecules, regarded as collections including a composite particle and a large number of pairs of elementary particles and antiparticles. While it is not clear if this is a correct description of the reality, it can become a basis of an interesting model or useful picture of quantum mechanics. ",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the full complexity of optical fields requires complete control of all degrees-of-freedom within a region of space and time -- an open goal for present-day spatial light modulators (SLMs), active metasurfaces, and optical phased arrays. Here, we solve this challenge with a programmable photonic crystal cavity array enabled by four key advances: (i) near-unity vertical coupling to high-finesse microcavities through inverse design, (ii) scalable fabrication by optimized, 300 mm full-wafer processing, (iii) picometer-precision resonance alignment using automated, closed-loop \"holographic trimming\", and (iv) out-of-plane cavity control via a high-speed micro-LED array. Combining each, we demonstrate near-complete spatiotemporal control of a 64-resonator, two-dimensional SLM with nanosecond- and femtojoule-order switching. Simultaneously operating wavelength-scale modes near the space- and time-bandwidth limits, this work opens a new regime of programmability at the fundamental limits of multimode optical control. ",

    "abstract": "We present microscopic, multiple Landau level, (frustration-free and positive semi-definite) parent Hamiltonians whose ground states, realizing different quantum Hall fluids, are parton-like and whose excitations display either Abelian or non-Abelian braiding statistics. We prove ground state energy monotonicity theorems for systems with different particle numbers, demonstrate S-duality in the case of toroidal geometry and establish an exact zero-energy mode counting. The emergent Entangled Pauli Principle, introduced in Phys. Rev. B 98, 161118(R) (2018) and which defines the \"DNA\" of the quantum Hall fluid, is behind the exact determination of the topological characteristics of the fluid, including charge and braiding statistics of excitations, and effective edge theory descriptions. When the closed-shell condition is satisfied, the densest (i.e., the highest density and lowest total angular momentum) zero-energy mode is a unique parton state. As a corollary, it follows that the Moore-Read Pfaffian and Read-Rezayi states (both of which may be expressed as linear combinations of parton-like states) cannot be densest ground states of two-body parent Hamiltonians. We conjecture, based on the algebra of polynomials in holomormorphic and anti-holomorphic complex variables, that parton-like states span the subspace of many-body wave functions with the two-body $M$-clustering property, that is, wave functions with $M$th-order coincidence plane zeroes. We illustrate our framework by presenting a parent Hamiltonian whose excitations are rigorously proven to be Fibonacci anyons and show how to extract the DNA of the fluid whose entanglement pattern manifests in the form of a matrix product state.

    "title": "Beyond the density operator and Tr(\u03c1A): Exploiting the higher-order  statistics of random-coefficient pure states for quantum information  processing",
    "abstract": "Two types of states are widely used in quantum mechanics, namely (deterministic-coefficient) pure states and statistical mixtures. A density operator can be associated with each of them. We here address a third type of states, that we previously introduced in a more restricted framework. These states generalize pure ones by replacing each of their deterministic ket coefficients by a random variable. We therefore call them Random-Coefficient Pure States, or RCPS. We analyze their properties and their relationships with both types of usual states. We show that RCPS contain much richer information than the density operator and mean of observables that we associate with them. This occurs because the latter operator only exploits the second-order statistics of the random state coefficients, whereas their higher-order statistics contain additional information. That information can be accessed in practice with the multiple-preparation procedure that we propose for RCPS, by using second-order and higher-order statistics of associated random probabilities of measurement outcomes. Exploiting these higher-order statistics opens the way to a very general approach for performing advanced quantum information processing tasks. We illustrate the relevance of this approach with a generic example, dealing with the estimation of parameters of a quantum process and thus related to quantum process tomography. This parameter estimation is performed in the non-blind (i.e. supervised) or blind (i.e. unsupervised) mode. We show that this problem cannot be solved by using only the density operator \\rho of an RCPS and the associated mean value Tr(\\rho A) of the operator A that corresponds to the considered physical quantity. We succeed in solving this problem by exploiting a fourth-order statistical parameter of state coefficients, in addition to second-order statistics. Numerical tests validate this result. ",
