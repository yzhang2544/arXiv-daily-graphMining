    "title": "The (meta)metaphysics of science: the case of non-relativistic quantum  mechanics",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, to be a realist about something means believing in the independent existence of that something. In this line of thought, a scientific realist is someone who believes in the objective existence of the entities postulated by our best scientific theories. In metaphysical terms, what does that mean? In ontological terms, i.e., in terms about what exists, scientific realism can be understood as involving the adoption of an ontology that is scientifically informed. But according to some philosophers, the realistic attitude must go beyond ontology. The way in which this requirement has been understood involves providing a metaphysics for the entities postulated by science, that is, answering questions about the nature of what ontology admits to exist. We discuss how two fashionable approaches face the challenge of providing a metaphysics for science: a form of naturalism and the Viking/Toolbox approach. Finally, we present a third way, which adopts the best of both approaches: the meta-Popperian method, which focuses on discarding the wrong alternatives, or better saying, the metaphysical profiles incompatible with certain theories. We present the meta-Popperian method, a metametaphysical method capable of objectively assessing which metaphysical profiles are incompatible with certain scientific theories. For this, we will use quantum mechanics as a case study, presenting some previously obtained results. As our focus is on methodological questions about the relationship between metaphysics and science; with this method, we can see how science can be used to avoid error in metaphysical issues. In our opinion, this would be a way to develop a productive relationship between science and metaphysics. ",

    "abstract": "Ultrasensitive terahertz sensing of highly absorptive aqueous solutions remains challenging due to strong absorption of water in the terahertz regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a cost-effective metamaterial-based sensor integrated with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy for highly absorptive water-methanol mixture sensing. This metamaterial has simple asymmetric wire structures that support multiple resonances including a fundamental Fano resonance and higher order dipolar resonance in the terahertz regime. Both the resonance modes have strong intensity in the transmission spectra which we exploit for detection of the highly absorptive water-methanol mixtures. The experimentally characterized sensitivities of the Fano and dipole resonances for the water-methanol mixtures are found to be 160 and 305 GHz/RIU, respectively. This method provides a route for readily available metamaterial-assisted terahertz spectroscopy for ultrasensitive sensing of highly absorptive chemical and biochemical materials with multiple resonances and high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Using metasurfaces to control the wave propagation at will has been very successful over the broad electromagnetic spectrum in recent years. By encoding specially designed abrupt changes of electromagnetic parameters into metasurfaces, such as phase and amplitude, nearly arbitrary control over the output wavefronts could be realized. Constituted by a single- or fewlayer of planar structures, metasurfaces are straightforward in design and fabrication, thus promising many realistic applications. Moreover, such control concept can be further extended to the surface wave regime. In this review, we present our recent progress on metasurfaces capable of tailoring the propagation of both free-space and surface terahertz waves. Following an introduction of the basic concept and theory, a number of unique terahertz metasurfaces are presented, showing the ability in devising ultra-thin and compact functional terahertz components.

The expectation value of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of one- and two-body electronic and photonic RDMs, and the elements of these RDMs are optimized directly in polynomial time by semidefinite programming techniques, without knowledge of the full wave function. QED generalizations of important ensemble $N$-representability conditions are derived and enforced in this procedure. The resulting approach is applied to the description of classic ground-state strong electron correlation problems, augmented by the presence of ultrastrong light-matter coupling. First, we assess cavity-induced changes to the singlet-triplet energy gap of the linear oligoacene series; for a heptacene molecule modeled under experimentally feasible coupling strengths, this gap can change by as much as 1.9 kcal mol$^{-1}$ (or 15\\%). We also explore the metal-insulator transition in linear hydrogen chains and demonstrate that strong electron-photon interactions increase the insulating character of these systems under all coupling strengths considered.

    "abstract": "Output power of resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD) terahertz (THz) emitters can be modulated by the bias modulation similar to a semiconductor laser. This property is useful for applications of the THz waves to wireless communications and radars. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the modulation-frequency dependence of the output response using an equivalent circuit of the RTD-THz oscillator. It is shown that there exists an intrinsic cutoff frequency of modulation in RTD, which is independent of the external circuit that supplies the modulation signal to the oscillator. This cutoff frequency is determined by the time constant given by the capacitance of RTD divided by the absolute value of negative differential conductance minus loss conductance of the oscillator, and is about 100 GHz for typical RTD-THz oscillators. We also analyze the effect of external feedback injection on the modulation characteristics. If the period of the modulation frequency is equal to an integral multiple of the round-trip time of the feedback, a dip or peak occurs in the modulation response of the output, depending on whether the THz carrier components in the output and the feedback are in phase or out of phase. We also discuss the possibility of increase in cutoff frequency by the feedback with short round-trip time. ",

Using ring-polymer instanton theory to describe multidimensional tunnelling effects, combined with ab initio electronic structure calculations, we find that these quantum-mechanical simulations reveal a qualitatively different picture. Recombination of adsorbed H atoms, which was believed to be irrelevant at low temperature due to high barriers, is enabled by deep tunnelling, with reaction rates enhanced by tens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we identify a new path for H recombination that proceeds via multidimensional tunnelling, but would have been predicted to be unfeasible by a simple one-dimensional description of the reaction. The results suggest that hydrogen molecule formation at low temperatures are rather fast processes that should not be ignored in experimental settings and natural environments with graphene, graphite and other planar carbon segments.

These distributions are obtained from the Fourier spectrum of an arrangement of aperiodic diffracting structures. Interestingly, the resulting interference may present quasiperiodic structures of diffraction peaks on a number of distance scales, even though the diffracting structure is not periodic. We establish an analogy with revival phenomena in the evolution of quantum mechanical systems and illustrate this computation numerically and experimentally, obtaining excellent agreement with the proposed theory.

    "abstract": "Optical two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has become a powerful tool for studying energy level structure, dynamics, and coupling in many systems including atomic ensembles. Various types of two-dimensional (2D) spectra, including the so-called single-quantum, zero-quantum, and double-quantum 2D spectra, of both D lines (D$_1$ and D$_2$ transitions) of potassium (K) atoms have been reported previously. For rubidium (Rb), a major difference is that the D-lines are about 15 nm apart as opposed to only about 3 nm for K. Simultaneously exciting both D-lines of Rb atoms requires a broader laser bandwidth for the experiment. Here, we report a broadband optical 2DCS experiment in an Rb atomic vapor. A complete set of single-quantum, zero-quantum, and double-quantum 2D spectra including both D-lines of Rb atoms were obtained. The experimental spectra were reproduced by simulated 2D spectra based on the perturbation solutions to the optical Bloch equations. This work in Rb atoms complements previous 2DCS studies of K and Rb with a narrower bandwidth that covers two D-lines of K or only a single D-line of Rb. The broadband excitation enables the capability to perform double-quantum and multi-quantum 2DCS of both D-lines of Rb to study many-body interactions and correlations in comparison with K atoms. ",

When the particle motion is confined to a plane, perpendicular to an imposed magnetic field, the equivalent flow dynamics is that of zero absolute vorticity obtained in a quasi 2D rotating frame, where the cyclotron frequency plays a role equivalent to that of the Coriolis frequency in a rotating frame. We show how the Landau levels and the extended modes in the integer quantum Hall effect are all mapped into such zero absolute vorticity-like plane Couette flows, where the latter exhibit a geostrophic-like balance between the magnetic force and the gradients of the quantum (Bohm) potential and the electric force.

Recent breakthroughs explain some of the observations through the Grote-Hynes theory, where the cavity introduces friction with the reaction coordinate, thus reducing the transmission coefficient and the rate. The regime of rate enhancement, the observed sharp resonances at varying cavity frequencies, and the survival of these effects in the collective regime remain mostly unexplained. In this paper, we consider the \\emph{cis}-\\emph{trans} isomerization of HONO atomistically using an \\emph{ab-initio} potential energy surface. We evaluate the transmission coefficient using the reactive flux method and identify the conditions for rate acceleration. In the underdamped, low-friction regime of the reaction coordinate, the cavity coupling enhances the rate with increasing coupling strength until reaching the Kramers turnover point. Sharp resonances in this regime are related to cavity-enabled energy redistribution channels. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum optics and ultracold gases are established fields, but they almost do not overlap: the quantum nature of light is typically neglected in works on ultracold atoms. In our work the quantumness of both light and ultracold matter plays a key role. First, we show that light is a quantum nondemolition (QND) probe of many-body phases: they can be distinguished by correlations and full distribution functions (we consider bosons, fermions, and dipolar molecules). Light is not only sensitive to densities, but also to the matter-field interference. Second, we prove that the measurement backaction constitutes a novel source of competitions in many-body systems, especially, for non-QND cases. This leads to a plethora of new phenomena: oscillations of multipartite entangled modes, protection and break-up of fermion pairs, antiferromagnetic orders, long-range pair tunnelling and entanglement beyond Hubbard models. We prove that feedback control induces phase transitions and tunes their universality class. Third, the quantization of trapping potential (quantum optical lattices) leads to novel phases, including both density orders (supersolids, density waves) and bond orders of matter fields (superfluid and supersolid dimers, trimers). Results beyond ultracold atoms include: We extend the paradigm of feedback control from the state control to control of phase transitions. We present the measurement backaction as a novel source of competitions in many-body physics. We merge quantum Zeno dynamics and non-Hermitian physics and show a novel type of Zeno phenomena with Raman transitions beyond Zeno dynamics. We propose quantum simulators based on collective light-matter interaction. Our models can be applied to arrays of other systems (qubits). In general, quantum measurements and feedback produce new phenomena untypical to both closed unitary systems and open dissipative ones in many-body physics. ",

    "abstract": "We report on the theoretical and experimental investigation of valley-selective optical Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts of exciton resonances in monolayers WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$ induced by strong circularly polarized nonresonant optical fields. We predict and observe transient shifts of both 1sA and 1sB exciton transitions in the linear interaction regime. The theoretical description is based on semiconductor Bloch equations. The solutions of the equations are obtained with a modified perturbation technique, which takes into account many-body Coulomb interaction effects. These solutions allow to explain the polarization dependence of the shifts and calculate their values analytically. We found experimentally the limits of the applicability of the theoretical description by observing the transient exciton spectra change due to many-body effects at high field amplitudes of the driving wave.

    "title": "Optical modelling of accommodative light field display system and  prediction of human eye responses",
    "abstract": "The spatio-angular resolution of a light field (LF) display is a crucial factor for delivering adequate spatial image quality and eliciting an accommodation response. Previous studies have modelled retinal image formation with an LF display and evaluated whether accommodation would be evoked correctly. The models were mostly based on ray-tracing and a schematic eye model, which pose computational complexity and inaccurately represent the human eye population's behaviour. We propose an efficient wave-optics-based framework to model the human eye and a general LF display. With the model, we simulated the retinal point spread function (PSF) of a point rendered by an LF display at various depths to characterise the retinal image quality. Additionally, accommodation responses to rendered LF images were estimated by computing the visual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function (VSOTF) from the PSFs. We assumed an ideal LF display that had an infinite spatial resolution and was free from optical aberrations in the simulation. We tested images rendered at 0--4 dioptres of depths having angular resolutions of up to 4x4 viewpoints within a pupil. The simulation predicted small and constant accommodation errors, which contradict the findings of previous studies. An evaluation of the optical resolution of the rendered retinal image suggested a trade-off between the maximum resolution achievable and the depth range of a rendered image where in-focus resolution is kept high. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate the upper bound of the optical performance of an LF display for realistically aberrated eyes, which may help to find an optimal spatio-angular resolution required to render a high quality 3D scene.

    "title": "Synthetic five-wave mixing in an integrated microcavity for  visible-telecom entanglement generation",
    "abstract": "Nonlinear optics processes lie at the heart of photonics and quantum optics for their indispensable role in light sources and information processing. During the past decades, the three- and four-wave mixing ($\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$) effects have been extensively studied, especially in the micro-/nano-structures by which the photon-photon interaction strength is greatly enhanced. So far, the high-order nonlinearity beyond the $\\chi^{(3)}$ has rarely been studied in dielectric materials due to their weak intrinsic nonlinear susceptibility, even in high-quality microcavities. Here, an effective five-wave mixing process ($\\chi^{(4)}$) is synthesized for the first time, by incorporating $\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ processes in a single microcavity. The coherence of the synthetic $\\chi^{(4)}$ is verified by generating time-energy entangled visible-telecom photon-pairs, which requires only one drive laser at the telecom waveband. The photon pair generation rate from the synthetic process shows an enhancement factor over $500$ times upon intrinsic five-wave mixing. Our work demonstrates a universal approach of nonlinear synthesis via photonic structure engineering at the mesoscopic scale rather than material engineering, and thus opens a new avenue for realizing high-order optical nonlinearities and exploring novel functional photonic devices.

D 98, 126009 (2018)] explore a gedankenexperiment in which the (gravitational or electromagnetic) interaction between two objects, one placed in a state of quantum superposition of two locations, seems to allow for faster-than-light communication. Building on the analysis carried out in Mari et al. [Sci. Rep. 6, 22777 (2016).], Belenchia et al. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] argue that, by considering the quantization of radiation and the existence of vacuum quantum fluctuations of the fields, the apparent possibility of superluminal signaling is completely avoided. Moreover, in the gravitational case, such a conclusion is taken as providing support for the view that gravity must necessarily have a quantum nature. In this work, we reconsider the situation and find several limitations of these assessments. ",

    "abstract": "We consider reflection and transmission of 2D quantum wavepackets with phase vortices (also known in optics as spatiotemporal vortex pulses) at potential step-like, delta-function, and rectangular barriers. The presence of a vortex significantly modifies the Wigner time delays and Goos-H\\\"{a}nchen shifts, previously studied for Gaussian-like wavepackets. In particular, the scattered wavepackets undergo non-zero time delays and lateral shifts even for purely real scattering coefficients, when the standard Wigner and Artmann formulae vanish. We derive analytical expressions for the vortex-induced times delays and spatial shifts of 2D vortices and verify these with numerical calculations of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The time delays and shifts are resonantly enhanced in the vicinity of the critical-angle incidence for a step-like potential and near transmission resonances for a rectangular barrier. ",

All properties of the dynamical system are faithfully encoded as quantum observables. The energy spectrum of these systems is $\\mathbb{R}$, yet there is no decay to infinite negative energy.
