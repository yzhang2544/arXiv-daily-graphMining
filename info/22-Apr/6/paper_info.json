    "abstract": "Many model potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been reported for water; however, none are strictly from \"first principles\". Here we report such a potential, based on a many-body representation at the CCSD(T) level of theory up to the ultimate 4-body interaction. The new PES is benchmarked for the isomers of the water hexamer for dissociation energies, harmonic frequencies, and unrestricted diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations of the zero-point energies of the Prism, Book, and Cage isomers. Dissociation energies of several isomers of the 20-mer agree well with recent benchmark energies. Exploratory DMC calculations on this cluster verify the robustness of the new PES for quantum simulations. The accuracy and speed of the new PES are demonstrated for standard condensed phase properties, i.e., the radial distribution function and the self-diffusion constant. Quantum effects are shown to be substantial for these observables and also needed to bring theory into an excellent agreement with experiment. ",

    "abstract": "Providing an accurate, representative sample of mass flux across large open areas for atmospheric studies or the extreme conditions of a hypersonic engine is challenging for traditional intrusive or point-based sensors. Here, we demonstrate that laser absorption spectroscopy with frequency combs can simultaneously measure all of the components of mass flux (velocity, temperature, pressure, and species concentration) with low uncertainty, spatial resolution corresponding to the span of the laser line of sight, and no supplemental sensor readings. The low uncertainty is provided by the broad spectral bandwidth, high resolution, and extremely well-known and controlled frequency axis of stabilized, mode-locked frequency combs. We demonstrate these capabilities in the isolator of a ground-test supersonic propulsion engine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The mass flux measurements are consistent within 3.6% of the facility-level engine air supply values. A vertical scan of the laser beams in the isolator measures the spatially resolved mass flux, which is compared with computational fluid dynamics simulations. A rigorous uncertainty analysis demonstrates a DCS instrument uncertainty of ~0.4%, and total uncertainty (including non-instrument sources) of ~7% for mass flux measurements. These measurements demonstrate DCS as a low-uncertainty mass flux sensor for a variety of applications. ",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces consisting of nano-scale structures are underpinning new physical principles for the creation and shaping of quantum states of light. Multi-photon states that are entangled in spatial or angular domains are an essential resource for quantum imaging and sensing applications, however their production traditionally relies on bulky nonlinear crystals. We predict and demonstrate experimentally the generation of spatially entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down-conversion from a metasurface incorporating a nonlinear thin film of lithium niobate. This is achieved through nonlocal resonances with tailored angular dispersion mediated by an integrated silica meta-grating, enabling control of the emission pattern and associated quantum states of photon pairs by designing the grating profile and tuning the pump frequency. We measure the correlations of photon positions and identify their spatial anti-bunching through violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, witnessing the presence of multi-mode entanglement. Simultaneously, the photon-pair rate is strongly enhanced by 450 times as compared to unpatterned films due to high-quality-factor metasurface resonances, and the coincidence to accidental ratio reaches 5000. These results pave the way to miniaturization of various quantum devices by incorporating ultra-thin metasurfaces functioning as room-temperature sources of quantum-entangled photons. ",

Higher energy resolution is required for biological imaging and microscope spectroscopy. In this paper, we report on a Au/Ti (10/20 nm) bilayer TES that showed high energy resolution. This was achieved by lowering the critical temperature Tc to 115 mK and the resultant energy resolution was 67 meV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 0.8 eV. When Tc was lowered to 115 mK, the theoretical resolution would scaled up to 30 meV FWHM, considering that the typical energy resolution of optical TESs is 150 meV and Tc is 300 mK. To investigate the gap between the theoretical expectation (30 meV) and the measured value (67 meV), we measured its complex impedance and current noise. We found excess Johnson noise in the TES and an excess Johnson term M was 1.5 at a bias point where the resistance was 10% of normal resistance. For reference, the TES was compared with a TES showing typical energy resolution (156 meV FWHM). We will discuss what improved the energy resolution and what might have been the limiting factor on it. ",

The peak dose delivered to the fused silica rods was $18$ MGy.

Traditionally, finite difference algorithms have been employed to solve these problems. In this paper, a novel numerical algorithm based on the spectral method is devised. The quasi-three-dimensional problem is transformed into a problem resembling a two-dimensional line source using an integral transformation strategy. Then, a stair-step approximation is adopted to address the range dependence of the two-dimensional problem; because this approximation is essentially a discretization, the range-dependent two-dimensional problem is further simplified into a one-dimensional problem. Finally, we apply the Chebyshev--Tau spectral method to accurately solve the one-dimensional problem. We present the corresponding numerical program for the proposed algorithm and describe some representative numerical examples. The simulation results ultimately verify the reliability and capability of the proposed algorithm. ",

Based on their good spatial resolution and high rate compatibility, pixelated silicon detectors could meet the new requirements. To assess their applicability in proton therapy, ATLAS pixelated silicon detectors are used to measure the lateral beam profile with high spatial resolution. Furthermore, a dose dependent detector calibration is presented to allow the measurement of the requested output constancy. A strategy to verify the proton energy during the daily quality assurance is under study.

Considering the clinical significance of coronary arteries, an efficient computer model is a vital step towards tissue engineering, enhancing the research of coronary diseases, and developing medical treatment and interventional tools. In this work, we apply inverse uncertainty quantification to a microscale agent-based arterial tissue model, a component of the 3D multiscale model of in-stent restenosis (ISR3D). IUQ provides calibration of the arterial tissue model to achieve realistic mechanical behaviour in line with the experimental data measured from the tissue's macroscopic behaviour. Bayesian calibration with bias term correction is applied as an IUQ technique to reduce the uncertainty of unknown polynomial coefficients of the attractive force function and achieve agreement with the experimental data based on the uniaxial strain tests of arterial tissue. Due to the high computational costs of the ISR3D model, the Gaussian process (GP) regression surrogate model is introduced to ensure the feasibility of the IUQ computations. The result is an IUQ methodology to calibrate a model with uncertain parameters and a microscale agent-based model of arterial tissue, which produces mechanical behaviour in line with the experimental data.

The proposed scheme is built on harnessing the collective behavior of laser networks for storing a number of phase patterns as stable fixed points of the governing dynamical equations and retrieving such patterns through proper excitation conditions, thus exhibiting an associative memory property. The associative memory functionality is first discussed in the strong pumping regime of a network of passive dissipatively coupled lasers which simulate the classical XY model. It is discussed that despite the large storage capacity of the network, the large overlap between fixed-point patterns effectively limits pattern retrieval to only two images. Next, we show that this restriction can be uplifted by using nonreciprocal coupling between lasers and this allows for utilizing a large storage capacity. This work opens new possibilities for neural computation with coherent laser networks as novel analog processors. In addition, the underlying dynamical model discussed here suggests a novel energy-based recurrent neural network that handles continuous data as opposed to Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines which are intrinsically binary systems.

Despite this impressive proof of concept, their overall size and considerable number of elements represent obstacles for the exploitation of these antennas in nanophotonic applications and for their incorporation onto photonic chips. In order to address these challenges, we investigate an alternative design. In particular, we numerically demonstrate unidirectionality of an ultracompact optical antenna based on two parallel gold nanorods (side-by-side dimer). Our results show that exciting the antiphase mode by an emitter placed in the near-field can lead to unidirectional emission. Furthermore, in order to verify the feasibility of this design, we study the effect on the directionality of several parameters such as shape of the nanorods, possible defects in dimer assembly, and different position and orientation of the emitter. We conclude that this design is robust to changes, making it experimentally achievable. ",

The electrical interface of these ASICs to frontend printed circuit boards (PCBs) is commonly accomplished with wire bonds. Through Silicon Via (TSV) technology has been proposed as an alternative interconnect technique that will reduce assembly complexity of ASIC packaging by replacing wire bonding with flip-chip bonding. TSV technology is advantageous in large detector arrays where TSVs enable close detector tiling on all sides. Wafer-level probe card testing of TSV ASICs is frustrated by solder balls introduced onto the ASIC surface for flip-chip bonding that hamper alignment. Therefore, we developed the ASIC Test Stand (ATS) to enable rapid screening and characterization of individual ASIC die. We successfully demonstrated ATS operation on ASICs originally developed for CdZnTe detectors on the Nuclear Spectroscopic and Telescope Array (\\textit{NuSTAR}) mission that were later modified with TSVs in a via-last process. We tested both back-side blind-TSVs and front-side through-TSVs, with results from internal test pulser measurements that demonstrate performance equal to or exceeding the probe card wafer-level testing data. The ATS can easily be expanded or duplicated in order to parallelize ASIC screening for large area imaging detectors of future space programs. ",

    "abstract": "Recent progresses have revealed that quantum systems with multiple position-dependent couplings, e.g., giant atoms, can exhibit some unconventional phenomena, such as non-exponential decay etc. However, their potential applications are still open questions. In this paper, we propose a giant-cavity-based quantum sensor for the first time, whose performance can be greatly enhanced compared to traditional cavity-based sensors. In our proposal, two cavities couple to a dissipative reservoir at multiple points while they couple to a gain reservoir in a single-point way. To detecting a unknown parameter using this sensor, a waveguide is coupled to one of the cavities where detecting fields can pass through for homodyne detection. We find that multiple position-dependent couplings can induce an inherent non-reciprocal coupling between the cavities, which can enhance the performance of sensors. Output noise in our scheme can be reduced to the shot noise level, which is about one order magnitude lower than the results in Ref. [Nature Communications, 2018, 9, 4320.]. Besides, the signal-to-noise ratio per photon is also enhanced by about one order of magnitude. These results show that the multiple-point-coupling structure is beneficial to nowadays quantum devices. ",

    "abstract": "I prove that, if a change happens in a closed quantum system so that its state is perfectly distinguishable from all past or future states, the Hamiltonian is $\\widehat{H}=-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial\\ }{\\partial\\tau}$. A time operator $\\widehat{\\tau}$ emerges as its canonical conjugate. This Hamiltonian is usually rejected because it has no ground state, but I show that even a weaker form of irreversibility is inconsistent with a ground state. What is the right choice, that the world's Hamiltonian is $-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial\\ }{\\partial\\tau}$, or that no change is irreversible? ",
