    "abstract": "Deep neural operators can learn operators mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces via deep neural networks and have become an emerging paradigm of scientific machine learning. However, training neural operators usually requires a large amount of high-fidelity data, which is often difficult to obtain in real engineering problems. Here, we address this challenge by using multifidelity learning, i.e., learning from multifidelity datasets. We develop a multifidelity neural operator based on a deep operator network (DeepONet). A multifidelity DeepONet includes two standard DeepONets coupled by residual learning and input augmentation. Multifidelity DeepONet significantly reduces the required amount of high-fidelity data and achieves one order of magnitude smaller error when using the same amount of high-fidelity data. We apply a multifidelity DeepONet to learn the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), a framework to compute nanoscale heat transport. By combining a trained multifidelity DeepONet with genetic algorithm or topology optimization, we demonstrate a fast solver for the inverse design of BTE problems. ",

    "title": "Entanglement, Complexity, and Causal Asymmetry in Quantum Theories",
    "abstract": "It is often claimed that one cannot locate a notion of causation in fundamental physical theories. The reason most commonly given is that the dynamics of those theories do not support any distinction between the past and the future, and this vitiates any attempt to locate a notion of causal asymmetry -- and thus of causation -- in fundamental physical theories. I argue that this is incorrect: the ubiquitous generation of entanglement between quantum systems grounds a relevant asymmetry in the dynamical evolution of quantum systems. I show that by exploiting a connection between the amount of entanglement in a quantum state and the algorithmic complexity of that state, one can use recently developed tools for causal inference to identify a causal asymmetry -- and a notion of causation -- in the dynamical evolution of quantum systems. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10701-022-00562-0 ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a unit cell showing a band-gap in the lower acoustic domain. The corresponding metamaterial is made up of a periodic arrangement of this unit cell. We rigorously show that the relaxed micromorphic model can be used for metamaterials' design at large scales as soon as suficiently large specimens are considered. We manufacture the metamaterial via metal etching procedures applied to a titanium plate so as to show that its production for realistic applications is viable. Experimental tests are also carried out confirming that the metamaterials' response is in good agreement with the theoretical design. In order to show that our micromorphic model opens unprecedented possibilities in metastructural design, we conceive a finite-size structure that is able to focus elastic energy in a confined region, thus enabling its possible subsequent re-use. Indeed, thanks to the introduction of a well-posed set of micromorphic boundary conditions, we can combine different metamaterials and classical Cauchy materials in such a way that the elastic energy produced by a source of vibrations is focused in specific collection points. The design of this structure would have not been otherwise possible (via e.g., direct simulations), due to the large dimensions of the metastructure, couting hundreds of unit cells. ",

We analyse these phenomena for (a) longitudinal sound waves in a gas or fluid and (b) transverse electromagnetic waves interacting with electrons in a plasma or metal. In both cases, assuming quasi-monochromatic yet arbitrarily inhomogeneous wavefields, the connections between the ponderomotive force, Stokes drift velocity, kinetic energy, and canonical wave momentum carried by the medium particles are given by the same simple expressions. This sheds light on the nature of these phenomena, their fine interplay, and can be useful for applications to dynamical transport phenomena in various types of waves. ",

    "title": "Introducing a Symmetry-Breaking Coupler into a Dielectric Metasurface  Enables Robust High-Q Quasibound States in the Continuum and Efficient  Nonlinear Frequency Conversion",
    "abstract": "Dielectric metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) exhibit very high quality factor resonances and electric field confinement. However, accessing the high-Q end of the quasi-BIC regime usually requires marginally distorting the metasurface design from a BIC condition, pushing the needed nanoscale fabrication precision to the limit. This work introduces a novel concept for generating high-Q quasi-BICs, which strongly relaxes this requirement by incorporating a relatively large perturbative element close to high-symmetry points of an undistorted BIC metasurface, acting as a coupler to the radiation continuum. We validate this approach by adding a $\\sim$100 nm diameter cylinder between two reflection-symmetry points separated by a 300 nm gap in an elliptical disk metasurface unit cell, using gallium phosphide as the dielectric. We find that high-Q resonances emerge when the cylindrical coupler is placed at any position between such symmetry points. We further explore this metasurface's second harmonic generation capability in the optical range. Displacing the coupler as much as a full diameter from a BIC condition produces record-breaking normalized conversion efficiencies >10$^{2}$ W$^{-1}$. The strategy of enclosing a disruptive element between multiple high-symmetry points in a BIC metasurface could be applied to construct robust high-Q quasi-BICs in many geometrical designs. ",

Polaron quasiparticle properties are essential to our understanding of a variety of paradigmatic quantum many-body systems realized in ultracold atomic gases and in the solid state, from imbalanced Bose-Fermi and Fermi-Fermi mixtures to fermionic Hubbard models. In this topical review, we focus on the so-called repulsive polaron branch, which emerges as an excited many-body state in systems with underlying attractive interactions such as ultracold atomic mixtures, and is characterized by an effective repulsion between the impurity and the surrounding medium. We give a brief account of the current theoretical and experimental understanding of repulsive polaron properties, for impurities embedded in both fermionic and bosonic media, and we highlight open issues deserving future investigations.
