    "abstract": "The Transition Edge Sensor is extremely sensitive to the change of temperature, combined with the high-Z metal of a certain thickness, it can realize the high energy resolution measurement of particles such as X-rays. X-rays with energies below 10 keV have very weak penetrating ability, so only a few microns thick of gold or bismuth can obtain quantum efficiency higher than 70\\%. Therefore, the entire structure of the TES X-ray detector in this energy range can be realized in the microfabrication process. However, for X-rays or gamma rays from 10 keV to 200 keV, sub-millimeter absorber layers are required, which cannot be realized by microfabrication process. This paper first briefly introduces a set of TES X-ray detectors and their auxiliary systems built by ShanghaiTech University, then focus on the introduction of the TES $\\gamma$-ray detector, with absorber based on an sub-millimeter lead-tin alloy sphere. The detector has a quantum efficiency above 70\\% near 100 keV, and an energy resolution of about 161.5eV@59.5keV. ",

A record high refractive index of 77.02+43.22i is obtained at terahertz frequencies. The detailed investigations reveal that the enhancement of the effective refractive index of the structure via deep subwavelength coupling in a bilayer design is governed by a power law, which is an effective and simpler approach to design high index metamaterial. The approach relies on deep subwavelength coupling to obtain extremely high refractive index values that can lead to many practical applications in the field of imaging, lithography, design of delay lines and interferometers.

The all-optical sensors do not suffer from electromagnetic interference. We choose to integrate a silicon slot double micro-ring (SDMR) resonators in an acoustically resonant membrane. Optimization of the several key structural parameters is investigated to achieve the mode-field distributions of transmission spectrum based on Comsol Multiphysics software. Our numerical studies show that the proposed ultrasonic sensor offers higher sensitivity and a larger detection frequency range than conventional piezoelectric based ultrasound transducer. For a SDMR system with an area of 15um*30um, sensitivity as high as 2453.7mv/kpa, and over a bandwidth range of 1-150MHz. The sensitivity value is 36 times higher than that of single slot micro-ring ultrasonic sensor. The theoretical-factor of the SDMR can be approximately 1.24*10^6 with bending radius of 5um. The investigation on the SDMR system is a valuable exploration of the photo-acoustic microscopy for the ultra-high Q factor and large frequency range. ",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor nanocrystals, quantum dots, are known to exhibit the quantum-confined Stark effect which reveals itself in the shift of their photoluminescence spectra in response to external electric field. It was, therefore, proposed to use quantum dots deposited on the microparticle surface for the optical measurement of the charge acquired by the microparticles in low-temperature plasmas. Thermal balance of a quantum dot residing on the surface of a microparticle immersed in a plasma is considered in this work. It is shown for typical plasma parameters that under periodically pulsed plasma conditions, the spectral shift of the photoluminescence of the quantum dot caused by the oscillations of its temperature becomes undetectable at the effective thermal flux characterizing the thermal contact between the quantum dot and the microparticle $\\sim 10^9$~s$^{-1}$. Under these conditions, the entire spectral shift observed during the period of plasma pulsing should be attributed to the quantum-confined Stark effect due to the microparticle charge. Lower-boundary estimate for the effective thermal flux for the direct contact between the quantum dot and the microparticle is $\\sim 10^{12}$~s$^{-1}$. ",

Narrowing the bandwidth will result in the lengthening of the coherence time. This will erase temporal distinguishability of photons due to time delay in pulsed photon interference. However, this is changed in an SU(1,1)-type quantum interferometer where quantum entanglement is involved. In this paper, we investigate how the temporal coherence of the fields in a pulse-pumped SU(1,1) interferometer changes with the bandwidth of optical filtering. We find that, because of the quantum entanglement, the coherence of the fields does not improve when optical filtering is applied, in contrary to the classical coherence theory, and quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum interference in addition to distinguishability.

    "abstract": "Metrology experiments can be limited by the noise produced by the laser involved via small fluctuations in the laser's power or frequency. Typically, active power stabilization schemes consisting of an in-loop sensor and a feedback control loop are employed. Those schemes are fundamentally limited by shot noise coupling at the in-loop sensor. In this letter we propose to use the optical spring effect to passively stabilize the classical power fluctuations of a laser beam. In a proof of principle experiment, we show that the relative power noise of the laser is stabilized from approximately $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ to a minimum value of $1.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$, corresponding to the power noise reduction by a factor of $125$. The bandwidth at which stabilization occurs ranges from $400$ Hz to $100$ kHz. The work reported in this letter further paves the way for high power laser stability techniques which could be implemented in optomechanical experiments and in gravitational wave detectors. ",

    "abstract": "Arrays of Rydberg atoms constitute a highly tunable, strongly interacting venue for the pursuit of exotic states of matter. We develop a new strategy for accessing a family of fractionalized phases known as quantum spin liquids in two-dimensional Rydberg arrays. We specifically use effective field theory methods to study arrays assembled from Rydberg chains tuned to an Ising phase transition that famously hosts emergent fermions propagating within each chain. This highly entangled starting point allows us to naturally access spin liquids familiar from Kitaev's honeycomb model, albeit from an entirely different framework. In particular, we argue that finite-range repulsive Rydberg interactions, which frustrate nearby symmetry-breaking orders, can enable coherent propagation of emergent fermions between the chains in which they were born. Delocalization of emergent fermions across the full two-dimensional Rydberg array yields a gapless Z2 spin liquid with a single massless Dirac cone. Here, the Rydberg occupation numbers exhibit universal power-law correlations that provide a straightforward experimental diagnostic of this phase. We further show that explicitly breaking symmetries perturbs the gapless spin liquid into gapped, topologically ordered descendants: Breaking lattice symmetries generates toric-code topological order, whereas introducing chirality generates non-Abelian Ising topological order. In the toric-code phase, we analytically construct microscopic incarnations of non-Abelian defects, which can be created and transported by dynamically controlling the atom positions in the array. Our work suggests that appropriately tuned Rydberg arrays provide a cold-atoms counterpart of solid-state 'Kitaev materials' and, more generally, spotlights a new angle for pursuing experimental platforms for Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalization.

While several reports on defect and strain-induced single photon emission from 2D chalcogenides exist, a bottom-up, lithography-free approach to producing a high density of emitters remains elusive. Further, the physical properties of quantum emission in the case of strained 2D semiconductors are far from being understood. Here, we demonstrate a bottom-up, scalable, and lithography-free approach to creating large areas of localized emitters with high density (~150 emitters/um2) in a WSe2 monolayer. We induce strain inside the WSe2 monolayer with high spatial density by conformally placing the WSe2 monolayer over a uniform array of Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm. Cryogenic, time-resolved, and gate-tunable luminescence measurements combined with near-field luminescence spectroscopy suggest the formation of localized states in strained regions that emit single photons with a high spatial density. Our approach of using a metal nanoparticle array to generate a high density of strained quantum emitters opens a new path towards scalable, tunable, and versatile quantum light sources. ",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic metasurfaces have attracted significant interest recently due to their low profile and advantageous applications. Practically, many metasurface designs start with a set of constraints for the radiated far-field, such as main-beam direction(s) and side lobe levels, and end with a non-uniform physical structure for the surface. This problem is quite challenging, since the required tangential field transformations are not completely known when only constraints are placed on the scattered fields. Hence, the required surface properties cannot be solved for analytically. Moreover, the translation of the desired surface properties to the physical unit cells can be time-consuming and difficult, as it is often a one-to-many mapping in a large solution space. Here, we divide the inverse design process into two steps: a macroscopic and microscopic design step. In the former, we use an iterative optimization process to find the surface properties that radiate a far-field pattern that complies with specified constraints. This iterative process exploits non-radiating currents to ensure a passive and lossless design. In the microscopic step, these optimized surface properties are realized with physical unit cells using machine learning surrogate models. The effectiveness of this end-to-end synthesis process is demonstrated through measurement results of a beam-splitting prototype. ",

As the size of such circuits is increased, maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging, leading to a reduction in the quality of the operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we show how embedding an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability over the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear optical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial multi-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these circuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show how their programmability allows us to turn the multi-mode fibre itself into a generalised multi-outcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. Finally, we discuss the scalability of our approach, numerically showing how a high circuit fidelity can be achieved with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode-mixer. Our work serves as an alternative yet powerful approach for realising precise control over high-dimensional quantum states of light, with clear applications in next-generation quantum communication and computing technologies.
