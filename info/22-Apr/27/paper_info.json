    "abstract": "Optical vortices, which have been extensively studied over the last decades, offer an additional degree of freedom useful in many applications, such as optical tweezers and quantum control. Stimulated Brillouin scattering, providing a narrow linewidth and a strong nonlinear response, has been used to realise quasi-continuous wave (CW) lasers. Here, we report stable oscillation of optical vortices and acoustic modes in a Brillouin laser based on chiral photonic crystal fibre, which robustly supports helical Bloch modes (HBMs) that carry circularly-polarized optical vortex and display circular birefringence. We implement a narrow-linewidth Brillouin fibre laser that stably emits 1st- and 2nd-order vortex-carrying HBMs. Angular momentum conservation selection rules dictate that pump and backward Brillouin signals have opposite topological charge and spin. Additionally, we show that when the chiral PCF is placed within a laser ring cavity, the linewidth-narrowing associated with lasing permits the peak of the Brillouin gain that corresponds to acoustic mode to be measured with resolution of 10 kHz and accuracy of 520 kHz. The results pave the way to a new generation of vortex-carrying SBS systems with applications in quantum information processing, vortex-carrying nonreciprocal systems. ",

    "abstract": "The development of integrated semiconductor lasers has miniaturized traditional bulky laser systems, enabling a wide range of photonic applications. A progression from pure III-V based lasers to III-V/external cavity structures has harnessed low-loss waveguides in different material systems, leading to significant improvements in laser coherence and stability. Despite these successes, however, key functions remain absent. In this work, we address a critical missing function by integrating the Pockels effect into a semiconductor laser. Using a hybrid integrated III-V/Lithium Niobate structure, we demonstrate several essential capabilities that have not existed in previous integrated lasers. These include a record-high frequency modulation speed of 2 exahertz/s (2.0$\\times$10$^{18}$ Hz/s) and fast switching at 50 MHz, both of which are made possible by integration of the electro-optic effect. Moreover, the device co-lases at infrared and visible frequencies via the second-harmonic frequency conversion process, the first such integrated multi-color laser. Combined with its narrow linewidth and wide tunability, this new type of integrated laser holds promise for many applications including LiDAR, microwave photonics, atomic physics, and AR/VR. ",

The probe uses Raman spectroscopy to detect TB in the supernatant of a patient's sputum. We deploy a machine learning algorithm, principal component analysis, on the acquired Raman data to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity. On testing 112 potential TB patients, our results show that the developed sensor's accuracy is 100% for true-positive and 93.4% for true-negative.

In this work, UV-LA is performed to regrow a silicon-on-insulator wafer partially amorphized by arsenic ion implantation as well as to activate the dopants. In a microsecond scale ( 10^-6 s to 10^-5 s) UV-LA process, monocrystalline solid phase recrystallization and dopant activation without junction deepening are evidenced, thus opening various applications in low thermal budget integration flows. However, some concerns remain. First, the surface morphology is degraded after the regrowth, possibly because of the non-perfect uniformity of the used laser beam and/or the formation of defects near the surface involving the excess dopants. Second, many of the dopants are inactive and seem to form deep levels in the Si band gap, suggesting a further optimization of the ion implantation condition to manage the initial crystal damage and the heating profile to better accommodate the dopants into the substitutional sites.

    "abstract": "The discovery of molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties such as specific frequency and intensity of absorption or emission is a major challenge in creating next-generation organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaics. This raises the question: how can we predict a potential chemical structure from these properties? Approaches that attempt to tackle this inverse design problem include virtual screening, active machine learning and genetic algorithms. However, these approaches rely on a molecular database or many electronic structure calculations, and significant computational savings could be achieved if there was prior knowledge of (i) whether the optoelectronic properties of a parent molecule could easily be improved and (ii) what morphing operations on a parent molecule could improve these properties. In this perspective we address both of these challenges from first principles. We firstly adapt the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule to organic chromophores and show how this indicates how easily the absorption and emission of a molecule can be improved. We then show how by combining electronic structure theory and intensity borrowing perturbation theory we can predict whether or not the proposed morphing operations will achieve the desired spectral alteration, and thereby derive widely-applicable design rules. We go on to provide proof-of-concept illustrations of this approach to optimizing the visible absorption of acenes and the emission of radical OLEDs. We believe this approach can be integrated into genetic algorithms by biasing morphing operations in favour of those which are likely to be successful, leading to faster molecular discovery and greener chemistry.

The optimization of the diffuse basis necessary for the Rydberg electron description was driven by the Koopmans' theorem and used the even tempered Gaussian (ETG) functions. The electronic correlation was sufficiently covered by the aug-ano-pVQZ basis that was carefully merged with the optimal contracted diffuse orbitals. At the EOM-CCSD level of theory and using only compact subsets of the resulting basis that were specifically selected for states of the given angular momentum, many more excited states could be reached than with superior and expensive approaches such as the method of the explicitly correlated Gaussians (ECG), while differing from the ECG excitation energies mostly only by several meV. Namely, the states up to 24S, 25P, 14D, 16F and 16G were obtained, some of which were even surpassing the accuracy of the Full-CI employing optimal Slater functions by an order of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "Fast (sub-second) spectroscopy with high spectral resolution is of vital importance for revealing quantum chemistry kinetics of complex chemical and biological reactions. Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers can achieve high spectral resolution and operate at hundreds of ms time scales in rapid-scan mode. However, the linear translation of a scanning mirror imposes stringent time-resolution limitations to these systems, which makes simultaneous high spectral and temporal resolution impossible. Here, we demonstrate an FT spectrometer whose operational principle is based on continuous rotational, rather than linear, motion of the scanning mirror, decoupling the spectral resolution from the temporal one. This enables 0.5 cm${}^{-1}$ resolution on sub-ms time scales. Furthermore, we show that such rotational FT spectrometers can perform dual-comb spectroscopy with a single comb source, since the Doppler-shifted version of the comb serves as the second comb. In this way, we combine the advantages of dual-comb and FT spectroscopy using a single quantum cascade laser frequency comb as a light source. Our technique does not require any diffractive or dispersive optical elements and hence preserve the Jacquinot's-, Fellgett's-, and Connes'-advantages of FT spectrometers. The system supports a large optical bandwidth from visible to THz frequencies. The combination of a rotational delay line with collimated coherent or non-coherent light sources pave the way for FT spectrometers in applications where high speed, large optical bandwidth, and high spectral resolution are desired.

High density optically transparent materials are ideally suited for this purpose since their density gradient can be measured with laser interferometry, and they allow in-situ optical metrology methods for the critical distance measurements often needed in a $G$ apparatus. We present an upper bound on possible internal density gradients in lead tungstate (PbWO$_4$) crystals determined using a laser interferometer. We placed an upper bound on the fractional atomic density gradient in two PbWO$_4$ test crystals of ${1 \\over \\rho}{d\\rho \\over dx}<2.1 \\times 10^{-8}$ cm$^{-1}$. This value is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than what is required for $G$ measurements. They are also consistent with but more sensitive than a recently reported measurements of the same samples, using neutron interferometry. These results indicate that PbWO$_4$ crystals are well suited to be used as test masses in $G$ experiments. Future measurements of internal density gradients of test masses used for measurements of $G$ can now be conducted non-destructively for a wide range of possible test masses. ",

Presence of a non-zero voltage reading in cases of no applied voltage is the experimental signature of a non-linear state-dependent shift of the electromagnetic field operator. We implement blinded measurement and data analysis with three control bit strings. Control of systematic effects is realized by producing one of the control bit strings with a classical random-bit generator.

Due to the fact that quantum mechanical experiments are, often, hard to be implemented, the possibility to connect delay times with laser lateral displacements gives us the opportunity to prepare, in optical laboratories, experiments which are equivalent to the quantum mechanical ones in detecting delay times. In this article, we will show in detail not only the relationship between delay times and Goos-Haenchen shifts, but also the close connection between the impulse change in quantum mechanics and angular deviations in optics. Lateral shifts are caused by the phase of Fresnel coefficients whereas angular deviations by the breaking of symmetry of the wave number distributions. The classical formula for the delay time is based on the use of the stationary phase method and contains a divergence for incidence at a critical potential energy. For Gaussian beams, the mean value calculation removes such a divergence. The closed expression for the delay time for incidence at critical energy show an excellent agreement with the numerical calculation. The three-dimensional analysis of delay times allow to find the final and definitive connection between wave packets reflected by a potential in quantum mechanics and optical beams reflected by a dielectric/air interface.

Here we provide a detailed analysis on why nonreciprocal photon-mediated interaction enhances inter-atomic excitation transport efficiency. We investigate a system consisting of two two-level emitters embedded in a generic photonic environment. By comparing symmetric and asymmetric photon-exchange, we analytically show that breaking electromagnetic reciprocity makes it possible for the cooperative decay rate to exceed the spontaneous decay rate even in a translation-invariant homogeneous system. This means that the excitation of an emitter must decay mostly into the other emitter rather than leaking and dissipating into the reservoir photonic modes. We also provide an example where a chain of two-level emitters dominantly interact via the reciprocal modes of a plasmonic waveguide. We then show that breaking reciprocity in such a system via driving a DC current through the plasmonic material can drastically increase the probability of photon emission from one emitter to another, leading to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in quantum energy-transport efficiency.
