    "abstract": "We present a detailed investigation on thickness-dependent third-order (\\c{hi}^(3)) nonlinear optical properties of RF-sputtered WSe2 thin-films using ultrashort pulses centered at different excitation wavelengths. The single-beam Z-scan based investigation in the visible spectrum reveals the prominent role of Pauli-blocking towards inducing saturable absorption or optical limiting in WSe2 thin-films of various thicknesses. The study also explores the dispersion in third-order nonlinear susceptibility (\\c{hi}^(3)) in WSe2 thin films. Interestingly, WSe2 thin-films of any thickness exhibit a self-focusing effect depicting a positive nonlinear refractive index (n2 > 0). The frequency-dependent nonlinear absorption (\\b{eta}) bear distinct correlations with the bandgap of the films which is also investigated through density-functional-theory (DFT) based simulations. The alteration in bandstructure is primarily due to the Se-deficiency induced defect bands in WSe2 thin-films which has discernible impact on the optical limiting characteristics. ",

The optical measurements determine the scattering and absorption cross-section spectra in absolute units, and electron tomography determines the 3D morphology. Numerical simulations of the spectra for the individual particle geometry, and the specific optical setup used, allow for a quantitative comparison including the cross-section magnitude. Silver nanoparticles produced by photochemically driven colloidal synthesis, including decahedra, tetrahedra and bi-tetrahedra are investigated. A mismatch of measured and simulated spectra is found when assuming pure silver particles, which is resolved by the presence of a few atomic layers of tarnish (Ag2S) on the surface, not evident in electron tomography.

In this work microsecond-scale UV-LA is applied on a stack comparable to an interconnect structure (dielectric/Cu/Ta/SiO2/Si) in either melt or sub-melt regime for grain growth.

While the fundamental emission linewidth of these lasers can be Fourier limited, their thermo-optic characteristics lead to drifts in their carrier frequency, posing important challenges for applications requiring ultra-stable emission. We propose here a method for measuring accurately the temperature-dependent index of refraction of diamond by employing standing Stokes waves produced in a monolithic Fabry-Perot (FP) diamond Raman resonator. Our approach takes into account the influence of the temperature on the first-order phonon line and the average lattice phonon frequency under intense stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) conditions. We further utilize this model to calculate the temperature-dependent thermo-optic coefficient and the Gruneisen parameter of diamond in the visible spectral range. The theory is accompanied by the demonstration of tunable Fourier-limited Stokes nanosecond pulses with a stabilized center frequency deviation of less than <4 MHz. ",

However, so far this effect has been shown to be sensitive to the incident polarization, restricting its applications. Here, we report, for the first time, polarization-independent resonant lattice Kerker effect in metasurfaces composed of periodic Ge$_2$Se$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) disks. For such a metasurface of square lattice, the spectrally overlap of the electric dipole and magnetic dipole surface lattice resonances can be realized by choosing an appropriate GST crystalline fraction regardless of the incident polarization. The operation wavelength and the required GST crystalline fraction can be conveniently tuned over large ranges since these parameters scale linearly with the disk size and the lattice period, greatly facilitating the design. Making use of the obtained resonant lattice Kerker effect, we realize a reconfigurable and polarization-independent lattice Huygens' metasurface with a dynamic phase modulation of close to $2\\pi$ and high transmittance. This work will advance the engineering of the resonant lattice Kerker effect and promote its applications in phase modulation and wavefront control. ",

    "abstract": "To undergo diffusive shock acceleration, electrons need to be pre-accelerated to increase their energies by several orders of magnitude, else their gyro-radii are smaller than the finite width of the shock. In oblique shocks, where the upstream magnetic field orientation is neither parallel or perpendicular to the shock normal, electrons can escape to the shock upstream, modifying the shock foot to a region called the electron foreshock. To determine the pre-acceleration in this region, we undertake PIC simulations of oblique shocks while varying the obliquity and in-plane angles. We show that while the proportion of reflected electrons is negligible for $\\theta_{\\rm Bn} = 74.3^\\circ$, it increases to $R \\sim 5\\%$ for $\\theta_{\\rm Bn} = 30^\\circ$, and that, via the electron acoustic instability, these electrons power electrostatic waves upstream with energy density proportional to $R^{0.6}$ and a wavelength $\\approx 2 \\lambda_{\\rm{se}}$, where $\\lambda_{\\rm{se}}$ is the electron skin length. While the initial reflection mechanism is typically a combination of shock surfing acceleration and magnetic mirroring, we show that once the electrostatic waves have been generated upstream they themselves can increase the momenta of upstream electrons parallel to the magnetic field. In $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of cases, upstream electrons are prematurely turned away from the shock and never injected downstream. In contrast, a similar fraction are re-scattered back towards the shock after reflection, re-interact with the shock with energies much greater than thermal, and cross into the downstream. ",

However, realization of custom-tailored waveforms needed for these applications is currently hindered due to limited flexibility for optical rectification of femtosecond pulses in bulk crystals. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) circuits provide a versatile solution for such waveform synthesis through combining the merits of complex integrated architectures, low-loss distribution of pump pulses on-chip, and an efficient optical rectification. Our distributed pulse phase-matching scheme grants shaping the temporal, spectral, phase, amplitude, and farfield characteristics of the emitted THz field through designer on-chip components. This strictly circumvents prior limitations caused by the phase-delay mismatch in conventional systems and relaxes the requirement for cumbersome spectral pre-engineering of the pumping light. We provide a toolbox of basic blocks that produce broadband emission up to 680 GHz with adaptable phase and coherence properties by using near-infrared pump pulse energies below 100 pJ. ",

    "abstract": "As a second paper in series with arXiv:2108.01539, we discuss here quantum vacuum friction on an intrinsically dissipative particle. The friction arises not only from the field fluctuations but also from the dipole fluctuations intrinsic to the particle. As a result, the dissipative particle can be out of the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), where it loses or gains internal energy. Only if the temperature of the particle equals a special NESS temperature will the particle be in NESS. We first derive the NESS conditions which give the NESS temperature of the particle as a function of the radiation temperature and the velocity of the particle. Imposing the NESS conditions, we then obtain an expression for the quantum vacuum friction in NESS. The NESS quantum vacuum friction is shown to be always negative definite, therefore a true drag. The NESS temperature and quantum vacuum friction are calculated numerically for various models. Out of NESS, even though the quantum vacuum frictional force no longer has a definite sign in the rest frame of the radiation, we find the external force needed to keep the particle moving must be in the same direction as the motion of the particle. This then excludes the possibility of making a perpetual motion machine, which could convert the vacuum energy into useful mechanical work. In addition, we find that the deviation of the temperature of the particle from its NESS temperature causes the particle to lose or gain internal energy in such a way that the particle would return to NESS after deviating from it. This enables experimental measurements of the NESS temperature of the particle to serve as a feasible signature for these quantum vacuum frictional effects. ",

Here, we show that these sources provide additional security benefits, thanks to the tunability of coherence in the emitted photon-number states. Generating either mixed or coherent states of light allows for enhanced performance of many quantum cryptography applications. We identify the optimal optical pumping scheme for the main quantum-cryptographic primitives, and benchmark their performance with respect to Poisson-distributed sources such as attenuated laser states and down-conversion sources.
