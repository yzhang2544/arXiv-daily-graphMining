    "abstract": "High-power infrared laser systems with broadband tunability are of great importance due to their wide range of applications in spectroscopy and free-space communications. These systems require nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for wavelength up/down conversion using sum/difference frequency generation, respectively. NLO crystals need to satisfy many competing criteria, including large nonlinear optical susceptibility, large laser induced damage threshold (LIDT), wide transparency range and phase-matchability. Here, we report bulk single crystals of SnP_2S_6 with a large non-resonant SHG coefficient of d33= 53 pm/V at 1550nm and a large LIDT of 350 GW/cm^2 for femtosecond laser pulses. It also exhibits a broad transparency range from 0.54 {\\mu}m to 8.5{\\mu}m (bandgap of ~2.3 eV) and can be both Type I and Type II phase-matched. The complete linear and SHG tensors are measured as well as predicted by first principles calculations, and they are in excellent agreement. A proximate double-resonance condition in the electronic band structure for both the fundamental and the SHG light is shown to enhance the non-resonant SHG response. Therefore, SnP2S6 is an outstanding candidate for infrared laser applications. ",

    "abstract": "In the recent past, optical tweezers incorporating a stratified medium have been exploited to generate complex translational and rotational dynamics in mesoscopic particles due to the coupling between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the light, generated as a consequence of the tight focusing of light by a high numerical aperture objective lens into the stratified medium. Here, we consider an optical tweezers system with a tilted stratified medium (direction of stratification at an angle with the axis of the incident beam), and show that for input circularly polarized Gaussian beams, the resulting spin-orbit interaction deeply influences the generation of transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM) and Belinfante momentum of light, and allows additional control on their magnitude. Importantly, the TSAM generated in our system consists of both the orthogonal components, which is in sharp contrast to the case of evanescent waves and surface plasmons, where only one of the TSAM components are generated. The broken symmetry due to the tilt ensures that, depending upon the helicity of the input beam, the magnitude of the mutually orthogonal components of the TSAM depend entirely on the tilt angle. This may prove to be an effective handle in exotic spin-controlled manipulation of particles in experiments. ",

Conventional WDM devices based on silicon waveguides and photonic crystals have limited transmittance due to high loss introduced by the strong backward scattering from defects. In addition, it is challenging to reduce the footprint of those devices. Here we theoretically demonstrate a WDM device in the telecommunication range based on all-dielectric silicon topological valley photonic crystal (VPC) structures. We tune its effective refractive index by tuning the physical parameters of the lattice in the silicon substrate, which can continuously tune the working wavelength range of the topological edge states, which allows designing WDM devices with different channels. The WDM device has two channels (1470 nm-1523 nm and 1548 nm-1609 nm), with contrast ratios of 22.4 dB and 24.9 dB, respectively. The principle of manipulating the working bandwidth of the topological edge states can be generally applied in designing different integratable photonic devices, thus it will find broad applications.

These modulators use a simple fabrication process; coating the top and bottom surfaces of a thin lithium niobate wafer with transparent electrodes.

Polarization of light propagating through this region is modulated at the applied frequency. Polarization modulation is converted to intensity modulation by placing the modulator between polarizers.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that flower-like hybrid nanostructures of NiCo2O4 and Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes (NCO@MWCNT) exhibit a strong non-linearity in their absorption, specifically an excited state absorption (ESA) induced RSA, when exposed to nanosecond laser pulses. We obtain strong nonlinear absorption coefficient (\\b{eta}) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) in hybrid NCO@MWCNT, the values that are 2-times and 2-orders of magnitude higher, respectively compared to NCO or MWCNT alone. This offers straightforward application in optical limiting with optical limiting (FOL) and optical onset (FON) threshold ca. 2-10 times lower than benchmark NLO materials, e.g., graphene, family of 2-D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials and recently established NCO. Notably, for femtosecond pumping, NLO response of NCO@MWCNT is dominated by saturable absorption (SA) with a week contribution from two photon absorption (TPA), arising respectively from MWCNT and NCO. A remarkable sign reversal along with a larger amplitude is obtained for n2 thanks to the charge transfer from MWCNT to NCO. ",

    "abstract": "Wetting of the membrane to displace air or conditioning liquids is important to exploit the complex porosity of a filtration membrane. This study reveals the details of wetting in multibore membrane-based filtration modules. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we quantify the fluid distribution patterns during initial membrane wetting in dead-end permeation mode. The spatio-temporal evolution of aqueous copper sulfate solution wetting the membrane fibers was investigated as a function of the applied flux, packing density, and position along the membrane module length. Three initial wetting conditions were examined: delivery-state membranes, ethanol-washed and dried (air-filled) membranes, and ethanol-filled membranes. Significant changes in wetting patterns were observed due to interfacial and polymer swelling effects. This in-situ investigation reveals a slow wetting progression over six hours and more to obtain complete wetting, even at high fluxes of 200 LMH. However, an increased flux leads to faster wetting kinetics as the evolving wetting patterns are flux dependent. The packing density of the multibore fibers additionally impacts the wetting kinetics by shifting the prevalent pressure conditions. Although in dead-end mode, the wetting progression is non-uniform along the membrane module length. In addition to this parameter study, different pre-wetting agents' effect on the displacement behavior was investigated in depth. This study helps to understand (a) complex wetting phenomena inside multibore membranes in dead-end filtration, (b) the membranes' interaction with their surroundings due to neighboring membranes, and (c) the effect of the used fluid system for displacement on the resulting wetting patterns.

Recently, we showed that such particle could support high-order Mie resonance modes with giant field localization and enhancement. Optimizing the internal fields appears as a key challenge for enhancing wave matter interactions in dielectric mesoscale particles. However, a dielectric particle is always located in some medium, and not in a vacuum. Moreover, the question is how much the environment medium affects the internal field intensities enhancement in the super-resonance effect. Based on Mie theory we show for the first time that the presence of the environment leads to a significant decrease in the intensity of the field in the particle. Thus, the study of the effect of super-resonance becomes meaningless without taking into account the environment. However, a greater enhancement of the internal field is found for the blue-shifted Mie size parameter of the sphere when the particle, for example, is in air rather than in vacuum. ",

Thermal reduction of [AuCl$_4$]$^-$ species to metallic gold phase, along with its subsequent mixing with silicon under laser irradiation creates a nanostructured material with a unique composition and morphology revealed by electron microscopy, tomography and elemental analysis. Combination of such basic plasmonic and nanophotonic materials as gold and silicon within a single microsphere allows for efficient light-to-heat conversion, as well as single-particle SERS sensing with temperature feedback modality and expanded functionality. Moreover, the characteristic Raman signal and hot-electron induced nonlinear photoluminescence coexisting within Au-Si hybrids, as well as commonly criticized randomness of the nanomaterials prepared by laser ablation in liquid, were proved useful for realization of anti-counterfeiting labels based on physically unclonable function approach.

    "abstract": "Fragmentation of liquid metal droplets irradiated by linearly and circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses is observed in our experiment. The obtained shadowgraph snapshots demonstrate that a circularly polarized pulse may produce several randomly-oriented jets effused from the expanding droplets, while a linearly polarized laser pulse generates strictly the cruciform jets. The latter orientation is tied with polarization plane, rotation of which causes rotation of the cruciform jets by the same angle. To shed light on the experimental data we performed molecular dynamics simulation of droplet expansion induced by angle-dependent heating. Our simulation shows that the jet directions are determined by an oriented angle-dependent energy distribution within a frontal hemisphere layer of droplet after absorption of linearly polarized light. As a result, the produced flow velocity field guided by surface tension forms two high-speed opposite jets oriented across the electric field vector as in our experiment. A shock-wave pulse generated in the frontal layer has angle-dependent amplitude inherited from the oriented energy deposition. The release part of shock pulse produces a cavitation zone nearby the droplet center, and thus an expanding spherical shell is formed from the droplet. The flow velocities within a rearside hemisphere of the shell, produced after reflection of the shock wave from the rear side of droplet, generate two low-speed opposite jets oriented along the electric field vector. Thus we found that the cruciform jets are originated independently from the frontal and rear sides of droplet, and a pair of frontal jets is faster than a pair of rearside jets. ",

Here, a Raman fiber laser (RFL) with reconfigurable and programmable spectra in an ultra-wide bandwidth is developed based on spectral-spatial manipulation of light in multimode fiber (MMF). The proposed fiber laser uses nonlinear gain from cascaded stimulated Raman scattering, random distributed feedback from Rayleigh scattering, and point feedback from an MMF-based smart spectral filter. Through wavefront shaping controlled by a genetic algorithm, light of selective wavelength(s) can be focused in the MMF, forming the filter that, together with the active part of the laser, actively shape the output spectrum with a high degree of freedom. We achieved arbitrary spectral shaping of the cascaded RFL (e.g., continuously tunable single-wavelength and multi-wavelength laser with customizable linewidth, mode separation, and power distribution) from the 1st- to the 3rd-order Stokes emission by adjusting the pump power and auto-optimization of the smart filter.

The gate is insensitive to the motional states of the particles -- the molecules can be in thermal states, the atoms do not need to be trapped during Rydberg excitation, the gate does not heat the molecules, and heating of the atoms is irrelevant. Within a large, static array, the gate can be applied to arbitrary pairs of molecules separated by tens of micrometres, making the scheme highly scalable. The molecule-atom interaction can also be used for rapid qubit initialization and efficient, non-destructive qubit readout, without driving any molecular transitions. Single qubit gates are driven using microwave pulses alone, exploiting the strong electric dipole transitions between rotational states.

Moreover, phonons are highly promising candidates to connect heterogeneous quantum systems on a chip, such as microwave and optical photons for long-distance transmission of quantum states via optical fibers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of distributing quantum information using phonons, by realizing quantum entanglement between two traveling phonons and creating a time-bin encoded traveling phononic qubit. The mechanical quantum state is generated in an optomechanical cavity and then launched into a phononic waveguide in which it propagates for around two hundred micrometers. We further show how the phononic, together with a photonic qubit, can be used to violate a Bell-type inequality. ",

    "title": "The self-learning AI controller for adaptive power beaming with  fiber-array laser transmitter system",
    "abstract": "In this study we consider adaptive power beaming with fiber-array laser transmitter system in presence of atmospheric turbulence. For optimization of power transition through the atmosphere fiber-array is traditionally controlled by stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm where control feedback is provided via radio frequency link by an optical-to-electrical power conversion sensor, attached to a cooperative target. The SPGD algorithm continuously and randomly perturbs voltages applied to fiber-array phase shifters and fiber tip positioners in order to maximize sensor signal, i.e. uses, so-called, \"blind\" optimization principle. In opposite to this approach a perspective artificially intelligent (AI) control systems for synthesis of optimal control can utilize various pupil- or target-plane data available for the analysis including wavefront sensor data, photo-voltaic array (PVA) data, other optical or atmospheric parameters, and potentially can eliminate well-known drawbacks of SPGD-based controllers. In this study an optimal control is synthesized by a deep neural network (DNN) using target-plane PVA sensor data as its input. A DNN training is occurred online in sync with control system operation and is performed by applying of small perturbations to DNN's outputs. This approach does not require initial DNN's pre-training as well as guarantees optimization of system performance in time. All theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments. ",
