    "abstract": "THz oscillators generated via frequency-multiplication of microwaves are facing difficulty in achieving low phase noise. Photonics-based techniques, in which optical two tones are translated to a THz wave through opto-electronic conversion, are promising if the relative phase noise between the two tones is well suppressed. Here, a THz ($\\approx$ 560 GHz) wave with an unprecedented phase noise is provided by a frequency-stabilized, dissipative Kerr microresonator soliton comb. The repetition frequency of the comb is stabilized to a long fiber in a two-wavelength delayed self-heterodyne interferometer, significantly reducing the phase noise of the THz wave. A new measurement technique to characterize the phase noise of the THz wave beyond the limit of a frequency-multiplied microwave is also demonstrated, showing the superior phase noise of the THz wave to any other THz oscillators (> 300 GHz).

While the 15N-1H multiple-quantum coherences can be directly excited from the dipolar order created by the method of adiabatic demagnetization in the rotating frame, it is technically more advantageous to acquire the chemical shift evolution of the heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence by two separate chemical shift evolution periods for 1H and 15N. We also show that the heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation spectrum can be obtained by shearing the corresponding heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectrum. ",

    "abstract": "It is critical to construct an accurate optical model of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in many applications to describe the angular and spectral responses of the photon detection efficiency (PDE) of the PMTs in their working media. In this study, we propose a new PMT optical model to describe both light interactions with the PMT window and optical processes inside PMTs with reasonable accuracy based on the optics theory and a GEANT4-based simulation toolkit. The proposed model builds a relationship between the PDE and the underlying processes that the PDE relies on. This model also provides a tool to transform the PDE measured in one working medium (like air) to the PDE in other media (like water, liquid scintillator, etc). Using two 20\" MCP-PMTs and one 20\" dynode PMT, we demonstrate a complete procedure to obtain the key parameters used in the model from experimental data, such as the optical properties of the antireflective coating and photocathode of the three PMTs. The proposed model can effectively reproduce the angular responses of the quantum efficiency of PMTs, even though an ideally uniform photocathode is assumed in the model. Interestingly, the proposed model predicts a similar level ($20\\%\\sim30\\%$) of light yield excess observed in the experimental data of many liquid scintillator-based neutrino detectors, compared with that predicted at the stage of detector design. However, this excess has never been explained, and the proposed PMT model provides a good explanation for it, which highlights the imperfections of PMT models used in their detector simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Optical tweezers employing forces produced by light underpin important manipulation tools in many areas of applied and biological physics. Conventional optical tweezers are based on refractive optics, and they require excessive auxiliary optical elements to reshape both amplitude and phase, as well as wavevector and angular momentum of light, and thus impose limitations to the overall cost and integration of optical systems. Metamaterials provide both electric and optically induced magnetic response in subwavelength optical structures, and they are highly beneficial to achieve unprecedented control of light required for many applications, also opening new opportunities for optical manipulation. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of optical tweezers employing the physics and concepts of metamaterials (the so-called meta-tweezers) and demonstrate that metamaterial structures could not only advance classical operations with particles, such as trapping, transporting, and sorting, but they uncover exotic optical forces such as pulling and lateral forces. Remarkably, apart from manipulation of particles, metastructures can be powered dynamically by light to realize ingenious meta-robots. We provide an outlook for future opportunities in this area ranging from enhanced particle manipulation to meta-robot actuation. ",

Numerical simulation is used to elucidate the role of the vortex biome as a function of nonlinearity strength and the initial spacing between the engineered vortices. The results apply directly to other nonlinear quantum fluids as well and may be useful in the control of complex condensates in which vortex dynamics produce topologically protected phases. ",

To avoid the need for a fluorescent label, the intrinsic autofluorescence of proteins in the ultraviolet offers the benefits of fluorescence techniques without introducing the labelling drawbacks. Unfortunately, the low autofluorescence brightness of proteins has greatly challenged single molecule detection so far. Here we introduce optical horn antennas, a dedicated nanophotonic platform enabling the label-free detection of single proteins in the UV. This design combines fluorescence plasmonic enhancement, efficient collection up to 85{\\textdegree} angle and background screening. We detect the UV autofluorescence from immobilized and diffusing single proteins, and monitor protein unfolding and dissociation upon denaturation. Optical horn antennas open up a unique and promising form of fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate single proteins in their native states in real time. ",

    "abstract": "When light propagates through a multimode optical fibre (MMF), the spatial information it carries is scrambled. Wavefront shaping can undo this scrambling, typically one spatial mode at a time - enabling deployment of MMFs as ultra-thin micro-endoscopes. In this work we go beyond serial wavefront shaping by showing how to simultaneously unscramble all spatial modes emerging from an MMF in parallel. We introduce a passive multiple-scattering element - crafted through the process of inverse design - that is complementary to an MMF and undoes its optical effects. This optical inverter makes possible both single-shot wide-field imaging and super-resolution imaging through MMFs. Our design consists of a cascade of diffractive elements, and can be understood from the perspective of both multi-plane light conversion, and as a physically inspired deep diffractive neural network. This physical architecture can outperform state-of-the-art electronic neural networks tasked with unscrambling light, as it preserves the phase and coherence information of the optical signals flowing through it. Here we demonstrate our MMF inversion concept through numerical simulations, and efficiently sort and unscramble up to ~400 step-index fibre modes, reforming incoherent images of scenes at arbitrary distances from the distal fibre facet. We also describe how our optical inverter can dynamically adapt to see through flexible fibres with a range of experimentally realistic TMs - made possible by moulding optical memory effects into the structure of our design. Although complex, our inversion scheme is based on current fabrication technology so could be realised in the near future. Beyond imaging through scattering media, these concepts open up a range of new avenues for optical multiplexing, communications and computation in the realms of classical and quantum photonics. ",

Due to absence of resistance-capacitance (RC) delay, high bandwidth and low power consumption, optoelectronic artificial synaptic devices are highly attractive. Yet stable, scalable, and complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible synapses have not been demonstrated. In this work, persistence in the photoconductivity of undoped and magnesium-doped scandium nitride (ScN) is equated to the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic plasticity of the biological synapses responsible for memory and learning. Primary functionalities of a biological synapse like short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), the transition from STM-to-LTM, learning and forgetting, frequency-selective optical filtering, frequency-dependent potentiation and depression, Hebbian learning, and logic gate operations are demonstrated.

Slightly above a specific electric field, a collisional shielding can take place, suppressing the molecular losses in a gas. The overall description of the quantum physical mechanism comes back to the dynamics on a unique energy surface, which depends on the relative distance and angular approach of the molecules. This surface enables to interpret how the dipole moments of the molecules are induced and interlocked by the electric field and the dipole-dipole interaction during the process, especially when the shielding is triggered. Averaging the relative angular motion over a unique partial wave (the lowest one when the ultracold regime is reached), the model reproduces well the behaviour of the rate coefficients observed experimentally and predicted theoretically [Matsuda et al., Science 370, 1324 (2020); Li et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 1144 (2021)]. This economic model encapsulates the main physics of the quantum process. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative to a full quantum dynamical treatment and is promising for future studies of collisions involving more bodies. ",
