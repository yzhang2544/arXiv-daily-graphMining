    "abstract": "Recent experiments and theory demonstrate that the the ground state properties and chemical reactivity of molecules can be modified inside an optical cavity. The vibrational strong or ultrastrong coupling results in the formation of vibrational polaritons which are usually observed through infrared spectra (IR). Here, we provide a theoretical framework to conduct multidimensional quantum simulations of the infrared spectra when the molecule is interacting with cavity modes. Taking single water molecule as an example, combing with accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces, our implemented cavity vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state configuration interaction (cVSCF/VCI) is shown to be able to provide quantitative predictions of the IR spectra when the molecule is inside or outside the cavity. The spectral signatures of resonance splittings and blue/red shift of certain bands are found to be highly related with the frequency and polarization direction of the cavity modes. Further analyses of the simulated spectra shows that polaritonic strong vibrational coupling greatly induce the coupling between molecule's vibrational modes, indicating the intramolecular vibrational energy transfer may be significantly accelerated by the cavity.

    "title": "Investigating the effects of electron bounce-cyclotron resonance on  plasma dynamics in capacitive discharges operated in the presence of a weak  transverse magnetic field",
    "abstract": "Recently, S Patil et al. have reported the existence of an enhanced operating regime when a low-pressure (5 mTorr) capacitively coupled discharge (CCP) is driven by a very high radio-frequency (60 MHz) source in the presence of a weak external magnetic field applied parallel to its electrodes. Their Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations show, that a significantly higher bulk plasma density and ion flux can be achieved at the electrode when the electron cyclotron frequency equals half of the applied RF frequency for a given fixed voltage. In the present work we take a detailed look at this phenomenon and further delineate the effect of this \"electron bounce cyclotron resonance (EBCR)\" on the electron and ion dynamics of the system. We find that the ionization collision rate and stochastic heating is maximum under resonance condition. The electron energy distribution function also indicates that the population of tail end electrons is highest for the case where EBCR is maximum. Formation of electric field transients in the bulk plasma region are also seen at lower values of applied magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate that the EBCR induced effect is a low pressure phenomenon and weakens as the neutral gas pressure increases. The potential utility of this effect to advance the operational performance of CCP devices for industrial purposes is discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have shown great potential for nonlinear optical applications, such as photon generation, all-optical switch, and time refraction because of the ultrafast hot electrons and hot-electron-induced nonlinearity enhancement. Recently, n-type inorganic ENZ materials, especially transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), with femtosecond hot-electron responses (<500fs) and huge optical nonlinearity enhancement (>2000 times) have been reported detailedly. Here, modified poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) p-type organic films exhibit vanishing real permittivity near 1550nm, namely in the conventional band (C band) for optical communications. We find that PEDOT films have a 100 times larger nonlinear response than indium tin oxide (ITO), a kind of classic inorganic ENZ material, in the non-ENZ region and a similar but less hot-carrier induced enhancement of optical nonlinearity. Furthermore, hot holes in modified PEDOT (p-type) films exhibit a longer relaxation time and a lower enhancement multiple of electron temperature than hot electrons in n-type inorganic ENZ materials. Our findings firstly offer new promising tunable organic ENZ materials with ENZ wavelengths in optical communication bands and reveal unique properties of organic ENZ materials as distinct from inorganic ENZ materials, which provide more possibilities for on-chip nanophotonic devices, nonlinear optics, and plasmonics.

While the presence of all unconventional polarization states makes the FP beams useful for various applications, the dependence of the refractive index on the polarization restricts the efficient generation of FP beams across the electromagnetic spectrum through nonlinear frequency processes. To avoid such difficulty, we use two contiguous BIBO crystals with orthogonal optic axes and generate an ultrafast FP beam at 405 nm with average power as high as 18.3 mW at a single-pass conversion efficiency of 2.19%. Using Stokes parameters and Stokes phases, we observed the doubling of C-points and L-lines singularities and the orbital angular momentum in the SHG process. We have also devised a new technique to estimate the polarization coverage of the pump and SHG FP beams and observed the variation in polarization coverage with the intensity weightage of the constituting beams. Interestingly, the SHG beam has the highest polarization coverage for the FP beam of equal intensity weightage of the superposed beams. We validated our experimental results in close agreement with the theoretical results. ",

The fast and deterministic polarization modulation means that the PMD noise is pushed far away from the frequencies of interest and upon reflection from a Faraday mirror at the receiver, the pulses have a well defined polarization when they return to the transmitter, which facilitates stable optical phase detection and fibre phase compensation. In an open-loop test setup that uses a mode-locked laser and a simple pulse interleaver, the polarization mode dispersion is shown to be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude ",

Such an analogue model of quantum gravity looks especially interesting near the phase transitions in hyperbolic metamaterials where it becomes possible to switch quantum gravity effects on and off as a function of metamaterial temperature. We also predict strong enhancement of sonoluminescence in ferrofluid based hyperbolic metamaterials, which looks analogous to particle creation in strong gravitational fields. ",

Current snapshot HSI techniques all require a trade-off between spatial and spectral resolution and are thus unable to achieve high resolutions in both simultaneously. Additionally, the techniques are resource inefficient with most of the photons lost through spectral filtering. Here, we demonstrate a snapshot HSI technique utilizing the strong spectro-temporal correlations inherent in entangled photons using a modified quantum ghost spectroscopy system, where the target is directly imaged with one photon and the spectral information gained through ghost spectroscopy from the partner photon. As only a few rows of pixels near the edge of the camera are used for the spectrometer, almost no spatial resolution is sacrificed for spectral. Also since no spectral filtering is required, all photons contribute to the HSI process making the technique much more resource efficient. ",

    "abstract": "Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) arrays are currently being developed and deployed for astronomical applications in the visible and near infrared and for sub-millimetre astronomy. One of the main drawbacks of MKIDs is that large arrays would exhibit a pixel yield, the percentage of individually distinguishable pixels to the total number of pixels, of 75 - 80 %. Imperfections arising during the fabrication can induce an uncontrolled shift in the resonance frequency of individual resonators which can end up resonating at the same frequency of a different resonator. This makes a number of resonators indistinguishable and therefore unusable for imaging. This paper proposes an approach to individually re-tune the colliding resonators in order to remove the degeneracy and increase the number of MKIDs with unique resonant frequencies. The frequency re-tuning is achieved through a DC bias of the resonator, the kinetic inductance of a superconducting thin film is current dependent and its dependence is non linear. Even though this approach has been already proposed, an innovative pixel design, described in this paper, may solve two issues previously described in literature such as increased electromagnetic losses to the DC-bias line, and the multiplexibility of multiple resonators on a single feedline.

Thus, a demand exists for the compatibility of quantum photonic processors with a larger wavelength range. Silicon nitride (SiN) has a high confinement and wide transparency window, enabling compact, low-loss quantum photonic processors at wavelengths outside the C band. Here, we report a SiN universal 12-mode quantum photonic processor with optimal operation at a wavelength of 940 nm, which is compatible with InGaAs quantum dot light sources that emit light in the 900 nm to 970 nm wavelength range. The processor can implement arbitrary unitary transformations on its 12 input modes with a fidelity of 98.6 %, with a mean optical loss of 3.4 dB/mode. ",

Cavity enhanced and long lived spin wave photon entanglement has been demonstrated by applying dual laser beams onto optical-lattice atoms. However, owing to cross readouts by two beams, retrieval efficiency of spin wave qubit is decreased by one quarter compared to that of single mode spin wave at all storage times. Here, by coupling cold atoms to two modes of a polarization interferometer based cavity, we achieve perfect qubit retrieval in cavity enhanced and long lived atom photon entanglement. A write laser beam is applied onto cold atoms, we then create a magnetic field insensitive spin wave qubit that is entangled with the photonic qubit encoded onto two arms of the interferometer. The spin wave qubit is retrieved by a read beam, which avoids the cross readouts.

    "abstract": "Under suitable assumptions, the algorithms in [Lin, Tong, Quantum 2020] can estimate the ground state energy and prepare the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian with near-optimal query complexities. However, this is based on a block encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, whose implementation is known to require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QET-U), which uses a controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit and no multi-qubit control operations, and is thus suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that outperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for estimating the ground state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians, we propose a new method that exploits certain anti-commutation relations and further removes the need of implementing the controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Coupled with Trotter based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM Qiskit for the transverse field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multi-qubit Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary amplitude estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal complexity for ground state preparation and energy estimating using a constant number of ancilla qubits (no more than 3). ",
