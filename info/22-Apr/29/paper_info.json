    "abstract": "We propose an electrically pumped laser diode based on multiple HgTe quantum wells with band structure engineered for Auger recombination suppression. A model for accounting for hot phonons is developed for calculating the nonequilibrium temperature of electrons and holes. Using a comprehensive model accounting for carrier drift and diffusion, Auger recombination and hotphonon effects, we predict of lasing at $\\lambda \\sim 3 $ $\\mu$m at room temperature in 2.2 nm HgTe/Cd$_{0.85}$Hg$_{0.15}$Te quantum well heterostructure. The output power in the pulse can reach up to 600 mW for 100 nanosecond-duration pulses. ",

    "title": "Smart sensors using artificial intelligence for on-detector electronics  and ASICs",
    "abstract": "Cutting edge detectors push sensing technology by further improving spatial and temporal resolution, increasing detector area and volume, and generally reducing backgrounds and noise. This has led to a explosion of more and more data being generated in next-generation experiments. Therefore, the need for near-sensor, at the data source, processing with more powerful algorithms is becoming increasingly important to more efficiently capture the right experimental data, reduce downstream system complexity, and enable faster and lower-power feedback loops. In this paper, we discuss the motivations and potential applications for on-detector AI. Furthermore, the unique requirements of particle physics can uniquely drive the development of novel AI hardware and design tools. We describe existing modern work for particle physics in this area. Finally, we outline a number of areas of opportunity where we can advance machine learning techniques, codesign workflows, and future microelectronics technologies which will accelerate design, performance, and implementations for next generation experiments.

    "abstract": "We formulate a non-relativistic quantum field theory to model interactions between quantized electromagnetic fields and localized charge-current distributions. The electronic degrees of freedom are encoded in microscopic polarization and magnetization field operators whose moments are identified with the multipole moments of the charge-current distribution. The multipolar Hamiltonian is obtained from the minimal coupling Hamiltonian through a unitary transformation corresponding to the canonical PZW transformation in classical or semi-classical theory; we renormalize this Hamiltonian at leading-order in perturbation theory, the result of which is used to compute the shift of the electronic energy levels due to interactions between the electrons and quantum vacuum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. Our renormalized energy shift constitutes a generalization of the Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen, valid for general localized assemblies of atoms and molecules, possibly with net charge but absent free current. By expanding the fields in a series of multipole moments, we study contributions to this energy shift coming from specific multipole moments. ",

    "abstract": "Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) is a state-of-the-art stochastic electronic structure method, providing a methodology to compute FCI-level state energies of molecular systems within a quantum chemical basis. However, especially to probe {\\em dynamics} at the FCIQMC level, it is necessary to devise more efficient schemes to produce nuclear forces and potential energy surfaces (PES) from FCIQMC. In this work, we derive the general formula for nuclear force from FCIQMC, and clarify different contributions of the total force. This method to obtain FCIQMC forces eliminates previous restrictions, and can be used with frozen core approximation and free selection of orbitals, making it promising for more efficient nuclear force calculations. After numerical check of this procedure on the binding curve of N$_2$ molecule, we use the FCIQMC energy and force to obtain the full-dimensional ground state PES of water molecule via Gaussian processes regression. The new water FCIQMC PES can be used as the basis for H$_2$O ground state nuclear dynamics, structure optimization, and rotation-vibrational spectrum calculation. ",

Single defect creation is demonstrated by photon antibunching in intensity-correlation experiments, thus establishing our approach as a reproducible procedure for generating single artificial atoms in silicon for quantum technologies.

We find analytical solution for the polariton density matrix, showing the polariton nonlinearity causing fast relaxation correlated with the pump so as to yield the condensation at threshold. Increasing the pump intensity, a nonequilibrium phase transition towards the condensation of lower polaritons emerges, with a statistics transiting from a thermal, through a super-Poissonian and to a nonclassical distribution beyond the understanding at the level of off-diagonal long-range order. The results signify the role of dark states for polariton fluctuations, and lead to a nonclassical counting statistics of emitted photons, which elaborates the role of the key parameters, e.g., pump, detuning and temperature.

    "abstract": "The simplest picture of excitons in materials with atomic-like localization of electrons is that of Frenkel excitons, where electrons and holes stay close together, which is associated with a large binding energy. Here, using the example of the layered oxide V2O5 , we show how localized charge-transfer excitations combine to form excitons that also have a huge binding energy but, at the same time, a large electron-hole distance, and we explain this seemingly contradictory finding. The anisotropy of the exciton delocalization is determined by the local anisotropy of the structure, whereas the exciton extends orthogonally to the chains formed by the crystal structure. Moreover, we show that the bright exciton goes together with a dark exciton of even larger binding energy and more pronounced anisotropy. These findings are obtained by combining first principles many-body perturbation theory calculations, ellipsometry experiments, and tight binding modelling, leading to very good agreement and a consistent picture. Our explanation is general and can be extended to other materials. ",

The resolving power of non-membrane MKIDs has remained stubbornly around 10 at 1 $\\mu$m despite significant improvements in the system noise. Here we show that the resolving power can be roughly doubled with a simple bilayer design without needing to place the device on a membrane, avoiding a significant increase in fabrication complexity. Based on modeling of the phonon propagation, we find that the majority of the improvement comes from the inability of high energy phonons to enter the additional layer due to the lack of available phonon states.
